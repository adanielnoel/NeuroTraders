Mixed earnings also added to the choppy action. For details, see [ID:nN28118907] and [ID:nLDE69R17T]\n\n\u201cThe more the market goes up, the more apprehensive investors are to continue to add risk,\u201d said Alan Lancz, president at Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc in Toledo, Ohio.\n\nLancz said that with the looming Fed statement and the U.S. elections next week, investors \u201cmay prune some risk and take some profits as the market has appreciated quite a bit over the past two months.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dipped 26.00 points, or 0.23 percent, to 11,100.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was off 1.02 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,181.43. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC eased 6.90 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,496.36.\n\nSince the beginning of September, the S&P 500 is up almost 13 percent.\n\nOn the downside, 3M Co (MMM.N) fell 5.2 percent to $85.65 after it shaved 6 cents off its full-year profit forecast. [ID:nN25282000]\n\nOn the upside, Motorola Inc MOT.N gained 5.3 percent to $8.52 after its mobile devices business posted a quarterly profit. Dow component Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) added nearly 1 percent to $66.21 as earnings beat expectations. [ID:nN28234253] and [ID:nN28202765]\n\nThe Nasdaq fared worse than the other two indexes as Research In Motion Ltd RIM.TORIMM.O fell 2.3 percent to $54.55 after Oppenheimer cut the stock to \u201cperform\u201d from \u201coutperform.\u201d [RCH/US]\n\nAnticipation of a Fed move has been a driver of recent market action as investors speculated over the size and time frame of further stimulus. Equity investors have bet that more easing will invigorate an economic recovery and lift asset prices.\n\nMost leading economists expected the Fed to buy between $80 billion and $100 billion in assets per month under a new program to bolster the struggling economy, a Reuters poll found.
