        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - St. Paul-based 3M Co, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers and the maker of Post-it notes, will take new steps to ensure that its suppliers of paper, pulp and packaging provide materials that come from sustainably logged timber.\n\nThe new paper-sourcing policy, aimed at preventing the destruction of fragile forests, comes after pressure on 3M from environmental activists, who accused the company of outdated practices.\n\nThe company, which also manufacturers Scotch brand tape products, will now require some 5,000 direct suppliers, located in more than 70 countries, to provide data, including the source of their harvested wood fiber. The company says it may sever ties with suppliers that fail to meet its standards.\n\nWhile other companies have also set conservation standards for their suppliers, 3M\u2019s action is expected to have broad ripple effects, because of the size of its supply network, said Todd Paglia, executive director at ForestEthics, a forest and climate advocacy organization.\n\nForestEthics, which led a campaign against 3M, is now applauding the company\u2019s new standards.\n\n\u201cNo other manufacturer has adopted such a rigorous policy with such reach around the world,\u201d Paglia said.\n\n3M is the latest company to take voluntary steps to reform its supply chain practices amid pressure from environmental groups. In January, Wilmar International Ltd, the world\u2019s largest palm oil processor, opened its supply chains to outside scrutiny in what environmentalists called an unprecedented step to help safeguard tropical forests.\n\nUnder 3M\u2019s policy, all paper-based products and packaging suppliers will be expected to harvest in ways that don\u2019t threaten peatland ecosystems and intact forest landscapes. The policy also aims to protect dense, high-carbon stock forests and ensure the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nThe company said it developed its policy in collaboration with environmental groups. The company is working with a non-profit agency, The Forest Trust, to help make sure suppliers are not running afoul of conservation standards. Greenpeace has also hailed the new policy.\n\nThe company, which declined to specify how much it spends purchasing paper products, is in the process of reviewing its suppliers and says it will issue its first public progress report in May.\n\n\u201cWe are taking responsibility for making sure our pulp and paper suppliers meet the requirements of the policy, and help them to raise their performance if necessary,\u201d said Jean Sweeney, 3M\u2019s vice president of environmental, health, safety and sustainability operations.\n\nAs a result of its new policy, 3M has entered into discussions with Canada\u2019s Resolute Forest Products Inc, which has been criticized by Greenpeace for its logging practices. Although 3M does not purchase material directly from Resolute, some companies that supply it with paper products do. Sweeney said that for now, 3M will not initiate new business that includes Resolute.\n\nA Resolute spokesman said the company does not comment on specific customer or vendor relationships, but said that \u201cResolute adheres to the letter and spirit of the law, and in many cases exceeds regulatory requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe actively speak with customers and prospective customers and tout Canada\u2019s leadership and our own leadership in forestry practices and in overall sustainability matters,\u201d said Seth Kursman, Resolute\u2019s vice president of corporate communications, sustainability and government affairs.\n\nAs part of its new initiative, 3M has created positions in each of its four regions around the world to oversee implementation of the paper-sourcing policy.\n\nThe costs of implementing the policy are immaterial to earnings, according to 3M, which reported $31.8 billion in sales last year.\n\nForestEthics ran a multi-year campaign against 3M that included a 40-foot Post-it note hung off a bridge near 3M\u2019s headquarters. The fake \u201cto-do list\u201d sign included the words \u201cdestroy forests\u201d with a checkmark next to it.\n\nUp to now, 3M has lacked a meaningful paper buying policy, said Rolf Skar, Greenpeace\u2019s forest campaign director. Greenpeace had been working behind the scenes and was considering ramping up its campaign if 3M did not act, Skar said.\n\n\u201cThey probably heard the footsteps of an escalating campaign, but also see sustainability as a brand asset,\u201d Skar said."
