        "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars and Swedish car safety supplier Autoliv (ALV.N) have signed a deal with U.S. firm Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), best known for its graphics technology in computer games, to develop software systems for self-driving cars.\n\nA joint venture between Volvo, owned by China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holdings [GEELY.UL], and Autoliv will work with NVIDIA to develop systems that use artificial intelligence to recognize objects around vehicles, anticipate threats and navigate safely.\n\nThe venture set up last year, called Zenuity, will provide Volvo Cars with self-driving software which Autoliv will also be able to sell to other carmakers.\n\nVolvo said it aims to have almost fully autonomous cars for sale by 2021.\n\nVolvo has been using Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence systems in a pilot of semi-autonomous vehicles in its home town Gothenburg in southern Sweden since the start of the year.\n\nNvidia, which also has partnerships with carmakers Toyota (7203.T), Audi (NSUG.DE) and Mercedes, is among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving car race.\n\nGerman carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has joined forces with U.S. chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) and Mobileye MBLY.N, the Israeli vision system and mapping expert, to develop a self-driving platform, which is targeted for production in 2021.\n\nU.S. parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH.N) and tyremaker Continental (CONG.DE) has since joined the tie-up.\n\nIn April, Germany\u2019s Daimler (DAIGn.DE) formed a similar alliance with supplier Robert Bosch ROBG.UL to speed development of self-driving vehicles."

This is why we are expanding our expert knowledge required. Cooperation with Nvidia will be a major step in this direction,\u201d he said.\n\nNvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called \u201cbrain\u201d of the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe U.S.-based group separately announced it was also partnering with Volvo Cars and Swedish auto supplier Autoliv to develop self-driving car technology for vehicles due to hit the market by 2021.

Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi is also using the system to reach full autonomous driving by 2020.\n\nIn a call with reporters, Nvidia\u2019s senior automotive director Danny Shapiro said carmakers and their main suppliers are now moving away from the research and development phase of autonomous vehicles and into concrete production plans.\n\nThe system developed jointly by ZF and Hella, and using Nvidia\u2019s Drive PX platform, will combine front cameras with radar and software to create technology meeting the Euro NCAP safety certification for so-called \u201cLevel 3\u201d driving, in which some, but not all, driving is performed by the car.\n\nVolvo is already using the Drive PX for the self-driving cars in its \u201cDrive Me\u201d autonomous pilot program.\n\nVolvo\u2019s production vehicles built on Nvidia\u2019s platform, as announced on Monday, are planned for sale by 2021.
