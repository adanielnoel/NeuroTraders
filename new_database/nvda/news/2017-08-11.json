        "body": "(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp\u2019s quarterly revenue in its widely watched data center and automotive businesses missed estimates, dragging down the chipmaker\u2019s shares that have nearly tripled in value over the past 12 months.\n\nNvidia shares were down 6.6 percent at $153.87 in extended trading on Thursday. Shares have risen 181 percent over the past year, the strongest performance across the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nNvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics-processing chips, but in recent years has been expanding into newer technologies including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars.\n\n\u201cNvidia was priced for perfection heading into earnings,\u201d said Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees, adding the company did not have any room for anything but perfection.\n\nRevenue from Nvidia\u2019s data center business \u2014 which counts Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp\u2019s Azure cloud business among its customers \u2014 more than doubled to $416 million but missed estimates of $423.3 million, according to FactSet.\n\nAutomotive business revenue surged 19.3 percent to $142 million, but also fell short of analyst expectations of $146.2 million, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.\n\nThe data center business is still relatively small and is driven by small number of customers who can change preferences tremendously from quarter to quarter, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.\n\nIt can be a big opportunity in the long term but is unpredictable in the near term, Rasgon added. \u201cThe issue here is that.. it\u2019s a lumpy business.\u201d\n\nHowever, earnings and revenue easily beat analysts\u2019 targets, partly due to strength in its traditional gaming chips, that are also used to process cryptocurrency transactions, said Chief Executive Jensen Huang on a post-earnings call on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin made cryptocurrencies popular in recent years, but newer technologies, including Ethereum, have sparked a wave of mining using high-end gaming graphics cards. Miners use computers to process cryptocurrency transactions, and they are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow. And over time, it will become quite large,\u201d Hang said.\n\nNet income more than doubled to $583 million, or 92 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 30.\n\nFor the third quarter, Nvidia said it expects revenue to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus 2 percent. Analysts were expecting $2.13 billion."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O) fell 3 percent on Thursday ahead of its quarterly earnings report, amid a broad market drop and despite expectations of strong revenue growth on demand for its chips from a wave of interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California company\u2019s expansion into cars, cloud computing and artificial intelligence has been richly rewarded with a 186-percent stock surge over the past year, the strongest performance across the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nBut even a strong quarterly report may not be enough to drive additional short-term gains, warned Joel Kulina, a technology stock trader at Wedbush in Toronto.\n\n\u201cMy gut is to the downside,\u201d Kulina said. \u201cIf it traded up 10 percent tonight, I\u2019d be floored.\u201d\n\nNvidia\u2019s drop on Thursday accompanied a 1.6 percent slump in the Nasdaq and a 1.1 percent decline in the S&P 500.\n\nThe company\u2019s second-quarter results, due out after the close of the U.S. stock market, are likely to be lifted by demand related to Nintendo\u2019s Switch videogame console and cryptocurrency \u201cminers,\u201d Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a research note on Tuesday.\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques for security and can be sold for money. Miners use computers to process cryptocurrency transactions, and they are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin BTC=BTSP made cryptocurrencies popular in recent years, but newer technologies, including Ethereum, have sparked a wave of mining using high-end gaming graphics cards. These cards are made with chips from Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), with some products selling out.\n\nFollowing its second-quarter report, AMD said cryptocurrency miners contributed to strong demand for its chips.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect Nvidia to report revenue growth for the quarter through July of 37 percent to $1.96 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nNvidia recently traded at 52 times expected earnings, compared to an earnings multiple of 57 for AMD and 12 for Intel (INTC.O).\n\nUnderscoring growing interest from technology heavyweights, Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Thursday announced it was working on blockchain, a public book-keeping system central to cryptocurrencies. Chipmaker Intel said in press release it was working with Microsoft on the project.\n\n\u201cIntel is an active participant in the blockchain revolution,\u201d it said."
