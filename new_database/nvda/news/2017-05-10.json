        "body": "(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) reported a better-than-expected 48.4 percent jump in quarterly revenue, helped by strong demand for its chips that are used by major cloud computing providers in data centers.\n\nNvidia\u2019s shares jumped 14.2 percent to $117.57 after the bell.\n\nData center revenue more than doubled in the first quarter to $409 million, handily beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $318.2 million, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cAll of the world\u2019s major internet and cloud service providers now use Nvidia\u2019s Tesla-based GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerators,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nKress said the major companies include Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, IBM Corp (IBM.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).\n\nNvidia\u2019s chips, also used by Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services, offer artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities that are crucial for faster data analysis.\n\nChief Executive Jensen Huang, who co-founded Nvidia and has led the company since its inception in 1993, has broadened its efforts into fast-growing areas such as the automotive semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s impressive about the numbers is the robust nature of Nvidia\u2019s business model as the company changes,\u201d Loop Capital analyst Betsy van Hees said.\n\nRevenue in Nvidia\u2019s automotive business, which produces the DRIVE PX 2 self-driving system used by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), reported a roughly 24 percent rise to $140 million.\n\nAnalysts were expecting revenue of $132 million, according to FactSet.\n\nRevenue from the company\u2019s gaming business, which includes the popular GeForce graphics card series, rose nearly 50 percent to $1.03 billion. The business accounted for 53 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue in the quarter.\n\nAnalysts were expecting revenue of $1.11 billion from the gaming business, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company also forecast current-quarter revenue of $1.95 billion, plus or minus 2 percent. Analysts on average were expecting $1.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe company\u2019s net income more than doubled to $507 million, or 79 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 30.\n\nNvidia\u2019s revenue jumped to $1.94 billion from $1.31 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThrough Tuesday's close, Nvidia's shares had fallen 3.6 percent this year, well underperforming the roughly 7 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 .SPX. The downturn comes after the stock more than tripled last year and was the best performer on the S&P 500."
