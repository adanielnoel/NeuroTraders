        "body": "(Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia Corp touched a record high for the second straight day on Monday following yet another steep increase in the chipmaker\u2019s price target by a Wall Street analyst.\n\nNvidia\u2019s shares, valued at a low $23.3 in 2015, have since surged to hit a high of $190.10 on Monday, with at least four brokerages setting their price targets at $200 or above.\n\nAnalysts have focused on the company\u2019s progress in artificial intelligence, in particular.\n\n\u201cOur sense is management believes that investors still severely underestimates the impact of AI and the size of the potential market,\u201d Evercore analyst C J Muse wrote in a note on Friday after hosting Nvidia\u2019s management.\n\nNvidia has been rapidly expanding into newer technologies including artificial intelligence, cloud computing and self-driving cars, away from designing graphics-processing chips for which the company was known for.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya listed Nvidia a \u201ctop pick\u201d, basing his view \u201con (Nvidia\u2018s) underappreciated transformation from a traditional PC graphics vendor, into a supplier into high-end gaming, enterprise graphics, cloud, accelerated computing and automotive markets,\u201d according to Seeking Alpha.\n\nArya raised his price target on Monday by $25 to $210, the second highest on the Street. Evercore ISI\u2019s whopping $70 price target raise on Friday to $250 is currently the highest.\n\nWall Street is bullish on the stock, with 22 of 38 brokerages having a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation, as per Thomson Reuters data. Twelve have \u201chold\u201d and 4 have \u201csell\u201d rating.\n\nBroadening its push into AI, Nvidia has been partnering with auto makers to help develop self-driving vehicles.\n\nIn May, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp through which the Japanese car maker would use Nvidia's AI technology to develop self-driving vehicle systems planned for the next few years. reut.rs/2wB8Qst\n\n\u201cNVDA has created an industry standard for AI systems that will be nearly impossible to replicate,\u201d Evercore\u2019s Muse wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nNvidia is also gaining from rising demand for its chips used to process cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nHowever, the company has little room for any missteps.\n\nNvidia\u2019s shares fell last month after the company\u2019s second-quarter revenue in its data center and automotive businesses missed estimates."
