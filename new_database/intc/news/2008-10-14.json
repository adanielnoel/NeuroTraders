        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) posted a 12 percent increase in third-quarter profit as gross margins beat expectations, sending its shares up 8 percent on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the world\u2019s largest chip maker guided lower Wall Street\u2019s expectations for revenue in the current quarter, analysts said the move was not as bad as some had feared.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that they did better than expected. Gross margins came in better than people were expecting, for both this quarter and in its outlook for the fourth quarter. For me, this is a relief rally more than anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouple of things I\u2018m looking for on the call: they lowered capital expenditure for 2008, the key is what the capex will be for 2009, since it\u2019ll affect gross margins. I\u2018m looking for a 2009 outlook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for how Intel shares will perform going forward, tell me how the market will do and I\u2019ll tell you how Intel will do. All things being equal, it should outperform the market, but who can tell with this crazy market these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile there will be estimate revisions in this earnings season, it seems they won\u2019t be disastrous. Intel\u2019s number cut (on fourth quarter revenue) was not that bad. It\u2019s definitely a shortfall. The consensus had been for $10.8 billion and now they are guiding more to like $10.5 billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey look pretty healthy to me and a little bit of a positive surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore important to me to some extent is gross margin, which I think people were looking for to come in at 57 percent, came in at 59 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this environment, the stock was trading down today basically reflecting the fact that the world is going to be slower in the future. These are numbers that if you have to be somewhere with a slower future, this may not be a bad place to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe revenue guidance was in line, which is better than feared and in this day and age that is considered good. The only thing we wanted to know was the revenue guidance and it was line with expectations and a little better than the worst case assumption. Net net it was a good guidance considering what people expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite as bad as we expected. It\u2019s a bit of a guide down on the revenue, but the stock is up because it isn\u2019t quite as bad as people thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody is going to guide down as Intel has done, but everybody\u2019s stock is already down. Now we need to see whether they are going to rally here. Intel is important because it is the first and it is big. How it trades tomorrow will give us some idea of what is going to happen with the rest of the earnings period.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe semiconductor companies are the back-end-of-the-food-chain kind of companies. We know that computer sales have gotten hit hard. It\u2019s a question of which companies are going to guide down earlier before they puke.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turns out the guidance, while it is below consensus, it\u2019s not substantially below consensus, which might explain why the stock was trading up in after-hours trading.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than feared and that\u2019s really all that Intel needed, given how far the stock had pulled back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe demand is a matter of the economic climate, so we\u2019re not seeing any issues with Intel\u2019s products because of Intel issues, we\u2019re seeing that the economy as a whole is putting pressure on consumers\u2019 spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re executing and you\u2019ve got to hand it to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s executing very well, and the signal regarding the rest of the industry is there does seem to be slowdown but it\u2019s not catastrophic.\u201d",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) Chief Executive Paul Otellini\u2019s said on Tuesday that it was too soon to know the extent of the global economic crisis, with some customers worried and others seeing little to no impact.\n\n\u201cThe financial crisis is creating some signs of stress that may impact our business, but the extent of that is difficult to quantify,\u201d Otellini told investors on a conference call as he discussed Intel\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.\n\nIntel, which supplies the chips that run roughly four out of every five of the world\u2019s personal computers, said it had yet to see any order cancellations -- known in the industry as \u201cpull-ins\u201d -- from PC makers worried by weak demand.\n\nWall Street analysts repeatedly probed but Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith stood firm and refused to speculate in a world that has seen record gyrations in the stock market in the last two weeks.\n\nExecutives said sales of chips that run powerful business computers known as servers was weak relative to what the company had expected, but that it was too early to say how this pattern would play out in the fourth quarter. But downplaying the risk of the Wall Street crisis to its business, Intel said financial firms buy only one in six of its server chips.\n\nSmith alluded that in less uncertain times the strength of the company\u2019s third-quarter results would have encouraged the company to provide a bullish outlook for the fourth quarter -- traditionally its seasonally strongest sales period.\n\n\u201cThe issues we have been talking about -- if you just look at Q3 (third quarter) you would expect a strong Q4 (fourth quarter) -- seasonal or maybe a little better,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel gave itself more running room in its predictions for the last quarter of this year and stayed away from venturing into predictions for next year.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest computer chipmaker said on Tuesday it expects revenue in the fourth quarter of $10.1 billion to $10.9 billion. The midpoint of that range, $10.5 billion, was around 2 percentage points lower than Wall Street had hoped.\n\n\u201cRight now as we look at the fourth quarter, we need to see the impact of what is roiling through the credit markets and that\u2019s what is giving us the higher range of potential outcomes for revenue in the fourth quarter,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have got to watch that and then we will have a better sense for 2009.\u201d\n\nThe best Intel would promise is that it will hold an update on Dec. 4 of its business midway through the fourth quarter -- six weeks before reporting its full, year-end results in January.\n\nOtellini did say sales could take a continuing hit from big business as corporate budget cutters scale back computer purchases. \u201cWe expect the corporate segment to continue to show some softness as IT (information technology) spending gets rationalized in this macro environment,\u201d he said.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Technology investors watching as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and other semiconductor makers report earnings this week have one question: How bad can it get?\n\n\u201cPeople expect the worst,\u201d said Doug Freedman of American Technology Research in San Francisco, speaking of Intel earnings, which are due on Tuesday and come against a backdrop of dismal economic news that has sent stocks down.\n\nChristopher Danely of J.P. Morgan in San Francisco said demand was going \u201cstraight down the tubes.\u201d\n\nEconomists worry that the United States is heading for recession affecting demand for everything from cars and houses to television and computers.\n\nTexas Instruments TXN.N, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N, Xilinx (XLNX.O) Inc and Altera Corp (ALTR.O) also report this week or next.\n\nBut analysts are not sure that all the bad news has trickled back to the microchip makers from companies that make, sell and distribute products that use chips.\n\n\u201cWhen Intel gives guidance it may or may not have received guidance from distributors that terrible things are happening,\u201d said Brian Piccioni of BMO Capital Markets in Canada.\n\nAnd that leaves things uncertain for now.\n\n\u201cWe all want to know about 2009. They (the companies) have no idea,\u201d said Danely. \u201cThey\u2019re not that scared and wonder why people on Wall Street are.\u201d\n\nHe said stocks reflect the market\u2019s understanding that business conditions will be bad for the first half of next year, even if the companies have been slow to acknowledge it.\n\nPatrick Wang, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan, said what companies say about the end of this year will also matter. \u201cWe do need to make sure inventories remain under control,\u201d he said.\n\nProblems extend beyond the rich markets in Europe and the United States. Edwin Mok of Needham & Company in San Francisco said distributors told him there are now demand problems in the smaller Asia market and emerging markets such as Brazil.\n\nAnalysts also question whether Intel\u2019s low-end Atom processor, introduced in March, might be selling quickly -- but at the expense of more profitable chips.\n\n\u201cI expect that the unit demand will expand more than people expect, but the value of those units is probably lower,\u201d said Freedman.\n\nMok said he is awaiting confirmation from Intel of its view that growth in demand for netbooks -- a new, small class of computers that are cheaper than laptops -- \u201cis incremental, not cannibalization of the higher-end machines.\u201d\n\nFreedman said the bad economic situation will be directly reflected in Intel\u2019s non-operating income, based on investments that take a hit from lower market prices.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the last time we had problems, their non-operating income line lost several million dollars,\u201d he said, recalling the last major downturn.\n\nOn the positive side, Freedman said Intel and some other chip firms will get a boost from a research and development tax credit in the $700 billion bailout for financial institutions enacted this month.",

Intel said its ability to cut microprocessor production costs as microprocessor revenue rose helped margins, even as demand shifted toward lower margin chips used in a new class of small computers called netbooks.\n\nIntel said it expected gross margin to remain at recent high levels around 59 percent during the fourth quarter, plus or minus a couple of percentage points.\n\nMarket research firm Gartner Inc also released data on Tuesday showing that personal computer unit shipments surged 15 percent in the third-quarter, but that much of this growth was for mini-notebooks that sell at prices under $500.",

PepsiCo\u2019s shares had their worst day since the 1987 stock market crash.\n\nThe Nasdaq underperformed throughout the day. Intel was among the top drags on the Nasdaq as investors worried about the chipmaker\u2019s quarterly results.

Citigroup jumped 18.2 percent and Bank of America climbed 16.4 percent.\n\n\u201cWhile a lot of news has been focused on financials, there is a slow motion tsunami coming our way as far as the economy is concerned,\u201d said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cTechs are cyclicals and have heavy exposure overseas, and the global economy is feeling a greater brunt of the slowdown,\u201d Goldman said.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was down 76.62 points, or 0.82 percent, at 9,310.99. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was down 5.34 points, or 0.53 percent, at 998.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 65.24 points, or 3.54 percent, at 1,779.01.\n\nEnergy and materials companies also fell as the price of oil slid on growing worries that a recession would curb the demand for oil and other commodities. Chevron shares fell 1.9 percent to $68.54.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures for November delivery fell $2.56, or 3.15 percent, to settle at $78.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s weaker-than-expected earnings also deepened concerns about how consumer spending will hold up in the face of declines in home values and stocks, as well as tighter credit. PepsiCo\u2019s shares tumbled 11.9 percent to $54.40.\n\nCoca-Cola was the biggest drag on the Dow, on investor concerns that rival soft-drink maker Pepsi\u2019s weak results may signal weakness in the rest of the beverage sector. Coca-Cola shares fell 7.5 percent to $43.73.\n\nAn index of retail stocks fell 4 percent on worries about consumer spending.\n\nApple Inc shares fell 5.6 percent to $104.08 after it cut the price on its entry-level notebook computer to $999 in a move expected to attract budget-minded buyers at a time when recession fears loom over the global economy.\n\nCitigroup and Bank of America ranked among the Dow\u2019s biggest percentage gainers. Citigroup climbed 18.2 percent to $18.62, while Bank of America surged 16.4 percent to $26.53. They are among the institutions widely reported to be included in the Treasury Department\u2019s plan to take equity stakes in banks to shore up the battered financial system.\n\nThe Treasury did not name the nine banks that will initially be participating in the program.\n\nTrading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.88 billion shares changing hands, below last year\u2019s estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.89 billion shares traded, above last year\u2019s daily average of 2.17 billion.\n\nAdvancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 17 to 15, while on the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by about 2 to 1.",
