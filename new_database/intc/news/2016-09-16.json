        "body": "JERUSALEM, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is collaborating with Intel Corp to develop a wearable device and machine learning platform for Huntington disease patients, Teva said on Thursday.\n\nThe platform will monitor and analyse key symptoms that impact daily living to better understand disease progression and improve treatment evaluation, Israel-based Teva, the world\u2019s largest generic drugmaker, said.\n\nHuntington is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by uncoordinated and uncontrollable movements, cognitive deterioration and behavioural and/or psychological problems.\n\nTeva, working with Intel, will deploy the technology in a sub-study within an ongoing study on Huntington, which will start later this year in the United States and Canada.\n\nPatients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure their functioning and movement. Data will be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform developed by Intel to analyse data from wearable devices.\n\n\u201cCurrent measurement of symptoms is largely based on observation when the patient sees the doctor,\u201d said Michael Hayden, president of Teva Global R&D. \u201cThis technology now provides us with an opportunity to have continuous monitoring.\u201d (Reporting by Steven Scheer; editing by Susan Thomas)",
