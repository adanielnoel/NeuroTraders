        "body": "July 17 - ASML\u2019s customer co-investment programme, which includes a proposed 15% equity participation by Intel, is positive for the Dutch-based lithography company on many fronts, and will have wider benefits for the semiconductor industry, Fitch Ratings says.\n\nThe programme will see Intel take an initial 10% stake, rising to 15% subject to ASML shareholder approval for total cash proceeds of EUR2.5bn. Negotiations with Samsung (\u2018A+'/Stable) and TSMC (not rated) could lead to them taking strategic stakes of up to a further 10%. Importantly, strategic owners will make material commitments to fund ASML\u2019s R&D for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and 450mm lithography, as well as advance purchase commitments for these technologies, over the next five years.\n\nThe announcement last week is a key development for ASML (\u2018BBB\u2019/Stable). It opens the way for significant minority ownership by some of the industry\u2019s largest manufacturers. Intel, Samsung and TSMC are ASML\u2019s largest customers and bellwether companies for capital spending and for dictating the pace at which lithography techniques can advance.\n\nIntel\u2019s commitment highlights how embedded ASML has become in the industry\u2019s supply chain, specifically in \u201cfeature shrink.\u201d This is the physics of making chips smaller and improving the capabilities of devices like smartphones.\n\nIn addition to its equity investment, Intel will commit R&D funding of approximately EUR830m over five years. Roughly two-thirds of this will be aimed at accelerating the ability to process 450mm wafers verses the current 300mm standard, and one-third to EUV. This investment is expected to bring forward the delivery of production tools for 450mm and second generation EUV by two years to 2018.\n\nEUV and 450mm are potentially the most important technological changes for the industry for the next 10 to 15 years. Equity and R&D participation by key customers shares the risks and mitigates the margin pressures caused by developing this level of new technology.\n\nThis acceleration and other co-investment agreements are likely to further consolidate advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, as perhaps one other lithographer and fewer semiconductor makers will have the resources to keep up. As a result, these companies are likely to consolidate market share.\n\nASML is being chosen by its customers to be one of the few members of the semiconductor supply chain with advanced technology capabilities. Leading edge lithography is now effectively a two-player market. Intel is also supporting Nikon\u2019s development of 450mm tools, but the structure and scale of the ASML investment stands out, while its R&D support for ASML\u2019s EUV development underlines ASML\u2019s leadership in advanced techniques. Partnerships of this nature and scale are likely, in our view, to make it difficult for ASML\u2019s competitor to win significant market share in this technology.\n\nFor Intel and the wider industry the programme accelerates the timing in which these technologies become available as mainstream production techniques. The move to 450mm will have significant cost advantages for the industry. Moving to 450mm from 300mm doubles the wafer area and the number of chips that can be produced on a wafer.\n\nIntel estimates 30% - 40% cost savings and an NPV benefit to its cost structure of USD10bn. These savings will multiply across the industry and the move to 450mm will now be possible that much sooner. The non-voting and non-exclusive nature of Intel\u2019s participation ensures that these benefits will be spread across the industry.\n\nFor Intel, the investment is a key element of its defence of the PC market against ARM-based processor solutions, as well as Intel\u2019s strategy to break into smartphone and tablet markets in the longer-term.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast weaker than expected current-quarter revenues, reinforcing fears that a wavering global economy and a lack of consumer interest are dampening personal computer sales.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, storage corporation EMC EMC.N and subsidiary VMWare Inc (VMW.N) announced preliminary quarterly results, and confirmed that EMC\u2019s Pat Gelsinger will take the helm at VMWare.\n\n\u201dThey cut numbers, but inventories are up quite a bit. Things are slowing and high inventories may be a headwind. People were expecting them to guide revenues to be flat or lower in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThings seem to be slowing much more. We still think the guidance is a bit too optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201dIntel did a very good job delivering results close to where estimates had drifted on the Street. Their Q3 estimate was very close to what I was expecting. If you look at the full-year guidance for 2012, they are basically saying 7.5 percent third quarter growth and mid single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s very close to Street expectations.\n\n\u201dAs macro events have transpired in the second quarter, people looked at the original high single-digit guidance as being stretched. The Street would have been concerned had they stuck with that guidance, but they didn\u2018t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a solid print and outlook for the third quarter and full year, given the economic backdrop they\u2019re dealing with. The PC client business -- their biggest -- was $60 million below our estimate. That\u2019s infinitesimal. The data center business was a little bit better than expected.\u201d\n\n\u201dExecution in Q2 was a little bit better than expected, but it looks like they are balancing that with a little bit lower revenue growth and spending than I was expecting in Q3. Gross margins look pretty good.\n\n\u201dThis will largely be viewed as in line, with Q2 a little bit better than expected. But there\u2019s a risk that these numbers could still sound challenging to achieve.\n\n\u201cThe seasonal growth that Intel is expecting is less than normal. That is clearly taking into account global macro conditions. Normal seasonal PC demand would show Q3 growth of at least 9 to 10 percent, and Intel\u2019s guidance is comfortably below that.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s an interesting move, Paul has done a tremendous job at VMWare. He\u2019s primarily responsible for taking VMWare from a startup to a global organization.\n\n\u201dThis is good for EMC. It needs the type of leadership that someone like Paul can bring. You have to wonder how much longer Joe Tucci will be CEO, and that Paul may take over if he wants to.\n\nVMWare has really kept up with Gartner\u2019s expectations in 2012 in server virtualization. Microsoft will not have a real competitive product out until the end of the year.\n\n\u201cPat Gelsinger is a very capable executive. For folks on the inside, it will be an easy transition because Pat is a lot like Paul with his tech background. He is not afraid to talk tech and he will have instant credibility in Palo Alto.\u201d\n\n\u201dThere\u2019s a sense of relief that the quarter is okay, but I don\u2019t think investors are happy to see EMC slopping out Paul Maritz. If It\u2019s not broken, why do you fix it?\n\n\u201dI\u2018m glad they made the quarter okay, but I don\u2019t like shifting management like this. I\u2018m just not convinced this is in the best interest of the shareholders.\n\n\u201dMaritz is a known entity, we already have a new CFO, why do we have to have a new CEO at this time? I don\u2019t think investors are happy.\n\n\u201cI mean he was running one of the biggest software companies, and now he\u2019s doing this strategy thing at EMC.\u201d",
