        "body": "(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) cut revenue growth forecast for its highly profitable business of making chips for data centers as businesses reduce spending due to weak macroeconomic growth.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker\u2019s shares reversed course to trade down as much as 3.8 percent after the bell on Tuesday following the forecast.\n\nIntel has been counting on the data center business to help offset declining demand for its chips used in personal computers, its biggest revenue generator.\n\nThe company agreed in June to acquire Altera Corp (ALTR.O) for $16.7 billion to expand its line-up of the higher-margin chips used in data centers.\n\nIntel said on Tuesday it expected the data center business to grow in \u201clow double digits\u201d in 2015, compared with its earlier forecast of about 15 percent growth.\n\nThe business, the company\u2019s second biggest, had grown 19.2 percent in the first quarter, 9.7 percent in the second and 12 percent in the latest quarter.\n\nThe company was not \u201crethinking the long-term growth\u201d of the business, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of two things \u2014 data center weakness and units \u2014 it looks like their units are still pretty weak, they are seeing upside from pricing,\u201d analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said.\n\nThe weak data center forecast took the shine away from the company\u2019s better-than-expected profit and revenue in the third quarter.\n\nThe company also trimmed its 2015 capital expenditure for the third time to $7.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.\n\nIntel had previously forecast capital expenditure of $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million.\n\nThe company said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The midpoint of the range is a marginal increase from a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nIntel said revenue from its PC business fell 7.5 percent to $8.51 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 26.\n\nWorldwide shipments of personal computers fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner.\n\nIntel\u2019s net income fell to $3.11 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 59 cents per share.\n\nNet revenue declined to $14.47 billion from $14.55 billion, but beat analysts\u2019 estimate of $14.22 billion.\n\nUp to Tuesday\u2019s close of $32.04, Intel\u2019s stock had fallen 11.7 percent this year, steeper than the 9.4 percent fall in the broader semiconductor index .SOX.",
