        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street expects bad news when Intel Corp (INTC.O) reports its second-quarter results on Wednesday although a few short sellers appear to believe the worst is over for the chipmaker\u2019s recently sinking stock.\n\nSigns of weak demand for personal computers have taken a toll on the shares of Intel ahead of its quarterly report due after the market\u2019s close, with Wall Street expecting a year-over-year dip in quarterly revenue for the first time since 2013.\n\nIntel\u2019s stock is down 18 percent year to date and has fallen about 7 percent since June 25, when Micron Technology (MU.O) blamed weakness in PCs for a drop in quarterly revenues.\n\n\u201cThe narrative is that it doesn\u2019t get much worse than it is right now,\u201d said FBR analyst Chris Rolland, who rates Intel \u201coutperform.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as DCG (the data center group) hangs in there, I think the stock will probably go up from here,\u201d he said.\n\nSuggesting that some short sellers believe Intel\u2019s stock is unlikely to fall much further, the number of shares borrowed has fallen 21 percent since June 29, according to SunGard\u2019s Astec Analytics.\n\nBut the number of Intel shares shorted at the end of June was the highest since mid-March according to exchange data.\n\n\u201cOur number still suggests many short sellers are holding onto their positions,\u201d wrote SunGard analyst Karl Loomes in an email.\n\nShares out on loan are typically used for short sales.\n\nOptions market traders appear to be slightly cautious ahead of Intel\u2019s report. Open interest in Intel puts has been growing at a faster pace than calls since June. Currently 1.2 puts are open for each call, the highest this reading has been this year according to Trade Alert.\n\nIntel\u2019s stock was flat on Tuesday and trades at 13 times expected earnings.\n\nAlso hurting Intel\u2019s stock recently, rival processor maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) last week posted a steeper-than-expected dip in fiscal first-quarter due to weakness in PCs.\n\nSeagate Technology (STX.O), which makes hard-drives for PCs, on Monday warned of poor results for its June quarter.\n\nIntel\u2019s data center group, which includes high-end server chips, has helped offset trouble in the PC industry in recent years, but it might also be at risk.\n\nLast Thursday, QLogic Corp\u2019s QLGC.O stock slid 21 percent after the network infrastructure maker warned that its revenue in the June quarter would be less than expected due to general weakness in server and storage markets.",
