The chip maker is counting on developers to fill the AppUp Center with free and paid applications designed for netbooks and other mobile devices that the company calls mobile Internet devices, a catch-all term that describes handheld devices with smaller screens.\n\nOf the eight applications mentioned in blog post, four of them -- Fring, PopCatcher, Fanomena, and Fluoh -- were either announced previously or are produced by developers that earlier voiced their support for the AppUp Center. The remaining four applications are video editor JayCut, image browser PhotoFlow, Last.fm client Vagalume, and EyeSight, an application that relies on a netbook\u2019s built-in camera to let users control the device and applications with hand gestures.\n\nMWC, which will be held in Barcelona, runs from Feb. 15 to Feb, 18.",
