        "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Intel Corp, the world\u2019s biggest computer chip maker, on Thursday won clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell an in-home health monitoring system for patients with chronic conditions.\n\nThe system, called Health Guide, combines an in-home patient device as well as online access that enables health care professionals to monitor patients and remotely manage care.\n\nIt incorporates interactive tools for personalized care management and integrates vital sign collection, patient reminders, multimedia educational content and feedback, and communications tools such as video conferencing and e-mail.\n\nThe Health Guide system can connect to specific models of wired and wireless medical devices, including blood pressure monitors, glucose meters, pulse oximeters, peak flow meters and weight scales. It also stores and displays collected information on a touch screen and sends to a secure host server, where health care professionals can review the information.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on chronic conditions and that\u2019s approaching a billion patients. The system will enable those people to connect with their caregivers from home,\u201d Louis Burns, vice president and general manager of Intel\u2019s Digital Health Group, said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe declined to estimate the size of the market or growth rates but said the system will initially be marketed to insurance companies, health care providers and governments.\n\nThe company is still doing pilot studies and initial results suggest using the system will save money, Burns said.\n\n\u201cThe feedback has been good. The clinicians like it and the elders like it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe elders like it because it\u2019s intuitive ... and they\u2019re an active participant in what\u2019s going on with their health,\u201d he said, adding that older patients are used to being put into a passive role with regard to their own health care.\n\nMedical device makers Medtronic Inc and St. Jude Medical Inc already have remote monitoring systems for heart patients. Burns said he viewed those systems as complements, rather than competitors, to Health Guide.\n\nIntel said it expects Health Guide to be commercially available from health care providers in the United States and the UK late this year or early next year.\n\nAndrew Rocklin, principal of Chicago-based Diamond Management and Technology Consultants, said the Intel system could be expanded to include patients just discharged from the hospital, as well as the generally healthy population looking to stay well.\n\nThe key to success, he said, is Intel\u2019s ability to sell it broadly so that it can be established as an industry standard.\n\n\u201cEven one big insurance company, or even better a consortia of insurance companies, could start driving scale,\u201d Rocklin said.\n\nShares of Intel, among the most actively traded on the Nasdaq Thursday morning, were up 15 cents to $19.96.",
