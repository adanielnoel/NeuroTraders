        "body": "(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world\u2019s largest computer chipmaker, raised its full-year revenue and profit forecasts, helped by strong growth in its data center business.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were up 2.2. percent at $42.25 in extended trading.\n\nFor the full year, the company said it expects to earn, on an adjusted basis, $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $3.01 per share on revenue of $61.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nIn July, the company had previously forecast full-year adjusted profit of $3 per share on revenue of $61.3 billion.\n\n\u201cThe combination of a solid quarter and healthy guidance will be something the bulls can hang their hat on tomorrow,\u201d Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights said.\n\nRevenue from Intel\u2019s higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent to $4.9 billion in the third quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectation of $4.79 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said on a call.\n\nIntel, which has been switching its focus to the data center business, is also venturing into newer areas such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars to reduce its reliance on the PC market.\n\nThe chipmaker completed the acquisition of Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N in August to compete with peers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and tap the fast-growing market of driverless cars.\n\n\u201cWith cloud, Internet of Things, and self-driving cars creating newer growth areas, now is the time for Intel to lay the seeds of growth in these key areas,\u201d Ives said.\n\nRevenue from client computing, as Intel calls its PC chip business, remained flat at $8.9 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.68 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nIntel recently launched its Coffee Lake line of processors, which analysts believe will pose challenges for rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc\u2019s (AMD.O) Ryzen processors.\n\nThe company's net income rose to $4.52 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $3.38 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2zRIW6x)\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.01 cents per share, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of 80 cents per share.",
