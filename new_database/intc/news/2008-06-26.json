        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker and decades-long business partner of Microsoft Corp, has no immediate plans to roll out the software giant\u2019s Windows Vista operating system to all its employees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a refresh cycle now and there are a number of factors considered before we select software,\u201d an Intel spokesman explained without elaborating.\n\nIntel and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have for years been known as \u201cWintel,\u201d because the two have worked together since the early days of the personal computer industry to tie Intel\u2019s microprocessors with Microsoft\u2019s operating system.\n\n\u201cWe are testing and deploying Windows Vista in certain departments,\u201d the Intel spokesman said.\n\nThe decision by Intel is the latest setback to Vista, which has faced slow adoption by large corporate customers, many of which are choosing to wait for the release of Microsoft\u2019s next operating system code-named Windows 7.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been very little enterprise-wide uptake of Vista,\u201d said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay, of big-business use of Vista across entire companies. \u201cThey look at Vista and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to throw out a bunch of hardware and software.'\u201d\n\nUsing Windows Vista can often require expensive upgrades of computer hardware, because Vista requires larger amounts of computer memory to run smoothly, among other requirements.\n\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, California, has about 80,000 employees across the globe and maintains a network of about a dozen multibillion dollar plants that churn out its processors that are the electronic brains of PCs.\n\nTogether, Intel and Microsoft control some 80 percent or more of the global personal computing industry.\n\nThe Inquirer, a London-based technology website, and the New York Times earlier reported Intel\u2019s decision not to roll out Vista across the entire company.\n\nAmong consumers, however, many millions of copies of Vista are in use, with Microsoft saying that more than 140 million copies are installed on PCs around the globe.\n\n\u201cThe consumer market is moving along apace,\u201d Kay said. \u201cAnd in the small- and medium-business market you\u2019re seeing decent adoption of Vista.\u201d",
