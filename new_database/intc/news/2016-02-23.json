        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wireless provider AT&T Inc said on Monday it will partner with chipmaker Intel Corp to test the functionality of drones on its high-speed LTE wireless network.\n\nAT&T will work with Intel to examine the efficiency of drones on its LTE network at higher altitudes and potential interference with airwaves related to areas such as video streaming and flight information, AT&T said in a statement.\n\nIntel has been aggressively investing in drone technology in recent years. With the U.S. wireless market over-saturated, AT&T is betting on growth from the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d, or web-connected machines and gadgets from cars, home appliances to drones, a new battleground for the company and rivals ranging from Verizon Communications Inc to Amazon.com Inc.\n\n\u201dAT&T and Intel will be testing how the network can enable the most exciting business use cases for drones,\u201d AT&T\u2019s senior vice president, Internet of things solutions, Chris Penrose, said.\n\nAT&T\u2019s LTE network can help bring wireless connectivity to industries such as logistics, agriculture, construction and insurance, he said.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week, Intel has set up an \u201cIntel Drone Zone\u201d to demonstrate its drone technology over AT&T\u2019s wireless network.",
