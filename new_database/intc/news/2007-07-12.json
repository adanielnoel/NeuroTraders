(INTC.O), saying the brokerage\u2019s checks suggested second-quarter sales were above the mid-point of the chipmaker\u2019s outlook.\n\nThe brokerage, which also raised its price target on the stock to $29 from $28, said it sees solid demand for the company\u2019s Merom family of processors.\n\nBanc of America now expects the company to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $8.7 billion in the second quarter. Its previous estimate was for a profit of 20 cents a share and sales of $8.6 billion.\n\nIn a note to investors, analyst Sumit Dhanda said he expects continued market share gains across all microprocessor segments. Dhanda cited Semiconductor Industry Association data, which he said showed well-above seasonal trends for processor shipments in the June quarter.\n\nDhanda kept his \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock.\n\nHe believes NOR flash sales of Intel, which is scheduled to report its earnings on July 17, improved from a depressed base in the first quarter. Desktop processor sales also appear to have staged a strong rebound, he added.\n\nThe analyst believes business momentum has improved across the sector. While demand uncertainties remain, key cyclical indicators -- like channel inventory and utilization trends -- are favorable, he said.\n\n\u201cStock prices also enjoying a tailwind from aggressive buyback programs,\u201d he added.
