I cannot comment on the timing of the decision,\u201d spokesman Jonathan Todd said.\n\nIntel shares were down 3.9 percent to $15.51 by 1742 GMT, underperforming a 1.4 percent lower Dow Jones industrial average .DJI.\n\n\u201cWe are not part of that (European Commission) decision making process. Those reports are speculative and therefore we will not comment,\u201d Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said.\n\nThe EU executive charged Intel in 2007 of giving illegal rebates to computer makers to limit their use of chips made by smaller rival AMD AMD.N or avoid them completely.\n\nIn July last year, it filed additional charges against Intel, saying it paid retailers not to sell PCs using AMD chips. Intel has said repeatedly it has not done anything wrong. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and David Lawsky; Editing by Bate Felix; editing by Simon Jessop)",
