The revision indicated the economic crisis is set to hurt computer sales even in the holiday season, and beyond.\n\nIntel said it expected a fourth-quarter revenue of $9 billion, plus or minus $300 million.\n\nBarrett said Intel\u2019s \u201ckey issue\u201d right now was to have a banking cushion or savings cushion to be able to stay the course in terms of its research and development budget and the overall capital budget, but the company was \u201calways looking at opportunities\u201d for acquisitions compatible with its business.",
