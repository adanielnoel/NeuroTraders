        "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel\u2019s top military electronic surveillance unit expelled dozens of veterans on Monday for refusing to spy on Palestinians living under occupation, Army Radio said.\n\nThe commander of Unit 8200, named as Brigadier-General \u201cA\u201d, barred the 43 reserve soldiers who wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top army chiefs in September, saying they could no longer serve in the unit, the radio said.\n\nComing a few weeks after Israel\u2019s 50-day war against Islamist militants in the Gaza Strip, the letter was seen as an unprecedented rebuke of Netanyahu\u2019s security policies but the military dismissed it as a publicity stunt by a small fringe.\n\nBy decrying the sweep of eavesdropping on Palestinians, and the role such espionage plays in setting up air strikes that have often inflicted civilian casualties, the move opened a window on clandestine practices.\n\n\u201cWe refuse to take part in actions against Palestinians and refuse to continue serving as a tool for deepening military rule in the occupied (Palestinian) territories,\u201d the Yedioth Ahronoth daily quoted the letter as saying.\n\nNo signatories\u2019 names were published, in apparent keeping with their non-disclosure commitments to Unit 8200, which monitors enemy Arab states and Iran as well as the Palestinians.\n\nSeveral were interviewed anonymously in the Israeli media, however, and complained about what they described as the gathering of Palestinians\u2019 private information - for example, sexual preferences or health problems \u201cthat might be used to extort people into becoming informants\u201d.\n\nChannel 1 TV quoted from Unit 8200 commander\u2019s dismissal letter: \u201cYou have crossed a red line and acted inappropriately and in light of what you have written, we part company with you.\u201d",
