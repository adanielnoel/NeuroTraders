        "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics, already a world leader in TVs and smartphones, is taking the fight to Intel Corp for the No.1 slot in semiconductors, betting on strong growth in so-called logic chips that are the brains inside today\u2019s fast-selling smart mobile devices.\n\nIntel dominates the market for computer processors (CPUs) - its Intel Inside sticker is on around 80 percent of the world\u2019s PCs - but future growth is in mobile application processors.\n\nDemand for these is seen rising around 40 percent annually through 2014, according to Nomura research, while growth in PC processors will be in single digits. By 2015, the global market for application processors (AP) will have jumped fourfold to $33 billion, while the CPU market will shrink by more than a tenth to $34 billion, according to NH Investment & Securities.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for leading AP makers such as Samsung, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and mobile chip designer ARM Holdings.\n\nIntel has yet to set a marker in the mobile chip market.\n\nSamsung, which leads the market in memory chips that are used in computers, is converting some memory chip production lines to logic chips and will invest close to $2 billion in a new logic chip plant in South Korea, in a clear bet that smartphones and tablets will be the real growth driver for a $311 billion global semiconductor industry that is being shaken up by the rapid advances in technology and consumer gadgetry.\n\n\u201cThe overall competition landscape will change as the boundary between CPU and AP blurs, with Intel trying mobile chips, and the performance of ARM-based APs improving to the level of CPU ... That indicates Samsung\u2019s ultimate target could be Intel and Qualcomm,\u201d said Greg Nho at HMC Investment & Securities.\n\nFrancis Sideco, analyst at research firm IHS iSuppli, predicted Samsung could overtake Intel in overall semiconductor output. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that would need Samsung to expand its (AP) customer base beyond themselves and Apple. Also, Intel would have to completely miss the boat on its mobile ambitions.\u201d\n\nSamsung has a headstart as it builds application processors that power the world\u2019s most popular smartphones and tablets - the iPhone, iPad and Samsung\u2019s own Galaxy products.\n\nIntel has little presence in this dynamic market. In April, India\u2019s little-known Lava International launched its Xolo X900 smartphone, the first to use Intel\u2019s new Medfield processor. Intel chips will also be used in some smartphones from Lenovo, Google\u2019s Motorola Mobility and others. This will give Intel an entrance to the mobile market, but it has yet to rival mainstream mobile chips such as Apple\u2019s A5, Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon and Samsung\u2019s Exynos processors.\n\n\u201cHow big they get and how fast remains to be determined ... I don\u2019t think anyone expects these to be mega hits, but rather proof of concept,\u201d said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna.\n\nIntel is also seeing its long-time partner Microsoft tie-up with ARM to take on Apple, as ARM\u2019s mobile-friendly chips may be better suited for tablets running Windows 8 - expected to be released by the fourth quarter. Microsoft\u2019s alliance with ARM, an Intel rival and the dominant designer of chips for smartphones and tablets, signals a shift in the tech balance of power from the \u2018Wintel\u2019 alliance that set the standard in early computing.\n\n\u201cSamsung is betting that mobile processor market growth will further accelerate when Windows 8 is released, which will use ARM-based application processors, and that\u2019s partly behind its aggressive capacity expansion,\u201d said NH Investment & Securities analyst Lee Sun-tae.\n\nLonger-term, it suggests application processors can be used in computers, encroaching on the market for central processing units (CPU), where Intel is leader.\n\n\u201cSamsung is expected to gain a toehold in the CPU market to be in direct competition with Intel, as power-efficient ARM-based application processors, which Samsung makes, will square off with Intel chips, which boast high performance but need to improve power efficiency,\u201d said Seo Won-seok, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.\n\nIntel had $48.7 billion of chip revenue last year - some $20 billion more than second-ranked Samsung - giving it 9.2 percent market share, according to iSuppli.\n\n\u201cCatching Intel would require significant growth in memory market share along with an Intel stumble,\u201d said Mike Howard, an analyst at iSuppli. \u201cWhile there are challenges for Samsung to continue to grow market share in memory (chips)... I would anticipate a major alliance, long-term, between Intel and another major memory company to rival Samsung.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, Intel\u2019s market share was 14.9 percent, more than three times Samsung\u2019s 3.9 percent. While Intel\u2019s share has since stagnated, Samsung\u2019s has increased to above 9 percent, prompting Intel to make acquisitions and expand into memory chips. Its market share was at a decade-high last year, boosted by rising sales of NAND flash memory chips and its acquisition of Infineon\u2019s wireless chip business.\n\nNow Samsung is chipping away at that gap again, and is expected to switch more of its memory chip lines to produce the chips used in tablets and smartphones.\n\nFor its part, Intel is betting its 2-year lead in manufacturing technology will help it keep ahead, and the Santa Clara, California-based firm is speeding up the rate at which it uses its most advanced factories to make mobile chips.\n\nIt is increasing capital spending by about 17 percent this year, and is building a $5 billion plant in Chandler, Arizona, which will manufacture chips at just 15 nanometers - that\u2019s the gap between the transistors, and is several thousand times thinner than a human hair. Samsung plans to use 20 nm and 14 nm technology when its new logic chip plant is completed late next year.\n\n\u201cAlthough ARM-camp players are also likely to enter 20-22 nm geometry in 2013, Intel should still be a step ahead of the competition as it already produced the 22 nm-based Ivy Bridge CPU for the computer market in 2012,\u201d Nomura analysts wrote in a recent note.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to forecast who will be the winner or if Intel\u2019s entrance will pose any substantial threat to the ARM camp, given that ARM architecture is unarguably ahead of (Intel\u2018s) x86 APs in power consumption, while production costs are also lower.\u201d\n\nSamsung\u2019s biggest challenge will be to get its mobile application chips into more devices than just its own and Apple\u2018s, particularly as the low-end smartphone market is growing at a much faster pace.\n\n\u201cWhat Samsung needs to address first is to diversify its customer base and make standard chips for a variety of customers - as Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Nvidia do,\u201d said HMC\u2019s Nho. Those firms\u2019 chips are found in products of LG Electronics, HTC and Motorola Mobility.\n\nAs new production lines come on stream in 2013 and Samsung finds new mobile chip customers, competition will heat up against Intel and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, which makes chips under contract for fab-less players such as Qualcomm and TI.\n\nBut Samsung\u2019s Achilles heel is that it competes in some product areas such as mobile phones with its potential chip foundry clients, which could make some firms uncomfortable in handing over their technology to a rival.\n\nA recent dispute with Apple over mobile patents, while at the same time supplying chips to its U.S. competitor, shows the sensitivity and complexity of such arrangements, sparking speculation that Apple may switch to TSMC, or even Intel, for some of its chips.\n\nIndeed, Apple increased purchase of mobile DRAM chips from Japan\u2019s Elpida late last year seeking to lessen its reliance on Samsung, which makes mobile processors, DRAM, NAND-flash chips and display screens for iPhones and iPads.\n\nA shuffle among Samsung\u2019s managers, with components chief Kwon Oh-hyun moving to CEO, is seen as addressing some of those concerns. \u201cSamsung is trying to alleviate component customers\u2019 concerns by putting the component side of the company back in the seat of power,\u201d said Mark Newman, a Bernstein analyst.",
