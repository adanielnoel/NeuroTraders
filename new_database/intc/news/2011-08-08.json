        "body": "* Outlook uncertain for much of chip market (Rewrites first paragraph, adds detail on Intel, background)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Intel\u2019s business is on course despite the meltdown in global stock markets and U.S. sovereign debt downgrade, thanks to demand in developing markets, its chief financial officer said.\n\nIn sharp contrast to panicked investors who sent the Dow Jones down more than 5 percent on Monday, an unruffled Stacy Smith said consumers in booming economies like China and Brazil that now make up half of Intel\u2019s sales were not scared by U.S. issues.\n\n\u201cWhen your country is doing well, you know, you\u2019re probably somewhat inoculated from some of the shocks going on elsewhere in the world,\u201d he said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.\n\nIntel\u2019s share price has bumped along at a low valuation for some time as investors have clamored for the Santa Clara, California company to move faster and more aggressively into mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets. Intel chips won\u2019t be in smartphones before next year, for instance.\n\nSmith, who himself carries three smartphones and also owns a tablet, insisted there were no signs of problems to make him change his business forecast. \u201cNothing that\u2019s happened in the last week or so changes my view of Q3,\u201d he added.\n\nHe spoke shortly after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 5.5 percent in reaction to S&P\u2019s cut of the U.S. sovereign debt rating.\n\nWhile analysts say the direct impact on the economy from the credit rating downgrade itself is limited, a sustained drop in share prices would have a negative impact on wealth, and likely force both consumers and businesses to hunker down.\n\nA few weeks ago, Intel trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets but pointing to healthy expansion in China.\n\nIntel could see more signs of trouble later this month as its manufacturing customers gauge demand for the normally-busy back-to-school season.\n\n\u201cThings could materially change, not just for Intel but for many companies later in August depending on feedback the supply chain gets about back to school,\u201d said Robert W Baird & Co analyst Tristan Gerra.\n\nFor years technology analysts predicted developing economies would leapfrog past desktop computers to buy thin, fast, Web-connected portables. Instead, Europeans and Americans have turned to the lighter devices while emerging market buyers have started off with robust PCs the whole family can use and that bring Intel big profits, Smith said.\n\nIntel remains notably more optimistic about the PC industry\u2019s prospects than many investors and executives in other parts of the electronics industry.\n\nMajor chip companies like ARM Holdings ARM.L and Texas Instruments TXN.N have warned that spending during the crucial holiday season could fall well short of expectations. [ID:nN1E76P0SU]\n\nEven blockbuster expectations for smartphones beyond Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) iPhones have cooled slightly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the specifics of the debt downgrade of the U.S. changes the overall business trajectory that we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d Smith said of Intel. He declined to discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter.\n\nLast month, Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of about $14 billion, give or take $500 million, better than the $13.5 billion analysts had expected on average. [ID:nN1E76I25R]\n\nIts shares are down almost 16 percent since hitting a year\u2019s high in May, but that vastly outperformed the plunge of roughly 24 percent by the Philadelphia semiconductor index .SOX.\n\nIntel, whose stock fell 3.27 percent on Monday, is not planning to start a new venture making chips for chip design companies, Smith said, knocking down speculation by some analysts.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of very small foundry deals ... but we have no plans to enter the foundry business,\u201d he said.
