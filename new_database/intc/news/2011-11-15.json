        "body": "AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian army defectors attacked an intelligence complex on the edge of Damascus early on Wednesday, in the first reported assault on a major security facility in the eight-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, activists said.\n\nMembers of the Free Syrian Army fired shoulder-mounted rockets and machineguns at a large Air Force Intelligence complex situated on the northern edge of the capital on the Damascus-Aleppo highway at about 2:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. EST).\n\nA gunfight ensued and helicopters circled the area, the sources said.\n\n\u201cI heard several explosions, the sound of machinegun fire being exchanged,\u201d said a resident of the suburb of Harasta, who declined to be named.\n\nThere was no immediate report of casualties and the area where the fighting occurred remained inaccessible, the sources said.\n\nSyria\u2019s ban on most foreign media makes it hard to verify events on the ground.\n\nTogether with Military Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence is in charge of preventing dissent within the army. The two divisions have been instrumental in a crackdown on the uprising against Assad, which the United Nations says has killed 3,500 people.\n\nSyria\u2019s military is controlled by Assad\u2019s brother Maher and members of their minority Alawite sect, while the army is comprised mostly of Sunni Muslims, who also form the majority of Syria\u2019s population and have been defecting from the army in mounting numbers.\n\nThe pervasive security apparatus, dominated by Alawites, underpins the power structure. Security chiefs of an estimated eight major secret police organizations answer directly to President Assad.\n\nAn Arab official, who did not want to be named, said insurgent attacks on loyalist forces rose sharply in the last 10 days, although the army remains largely cohesive.\n\nSyrian authorities blame \u201carmed terrorist groups\u201d for the unrest, and say they have killed 1,100 army and police.",
