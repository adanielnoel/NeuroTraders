        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 4 (Reuters) - Intel Corp\u2019s (INTC.O) shares climbed more than 1 percent on Wednesday with Wall Street investors expecting the world\u2019s largest chipmaker to take the wraps off its latest chip manufacturing technology.\n\nA number of brokerage analysts said Intel was likely to unveil cutting-edge 22 nanometer (nm) chipmaking technology during a news conference later on Wednesday. They said the technology may help Intel catch up in a global smartphone and mobile device market now dominated by rival ARM Holdings Plc ARM.L.\n\nARM\u2019s shares sank 7.7 percent in London trading. Intel was up as much as 1.3 percent at $23.55, before backing down to stand about 0.4 percent higher at $23.13. [ID:nLDE7430HD]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s speculation (the announcement) could relate to its new 22 nanometer production process due to start in November 2011, or may be about Intel\u2019s mobile chip Medfield,\u201d a European trader said.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Intel\u2019s processors are the brains in 80 percent of the world\u2019s personal computers but it has failed to make headway on gadgets like Apple\u2019s (AAPL.O) iPad.\n\nEnergy-efficient chips licensed by ARM that conserve smartphone batteries are favored by Apple and its competitors, and are the industry standard on mobile devices at Intel\u2019s expense.
