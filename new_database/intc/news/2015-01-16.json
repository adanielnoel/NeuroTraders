        "body": "(Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast revenue and gross margins for this quarter that disappointed investors, sending its shares down 2.7 percent in extended trading.\n\nRevenue from its mainstay PC business fell about 3 percent to $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter, raising doubts about a long-anticipated recovery of the personal computer business.\n\nGlobal PC shipments fell 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to research firm IDC, capping three years of declines.\n\nThat was not as bad as expected, raising hopes among some investors that the PC market is starting to stabilize, but Intel did not deliver any spirited talk about a recovery on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 we\u2019re predicting kind of flat, nothing spectacular but stable, is how I would call it,\u201d Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters in an interview.\n\nDespite the tepid PC market, Intel is targeting revenue growth this year in the \u201cmid-single digit percentage points\u201d, which Smith said would be helped by faster growth in providing chips for data centers and Internet-connected gadgets.\n\nOptimism over a PC recovery has propelled Intel\u2019s stock up 16 percent in the past three months, compared with a 7 percent gain for the S&P 500, to levels not seen since 2001.\n\nIn the light of that, Wall Street was hoping for more encouraging figures.\n\n\u201cThe top line looked a little bit light of the Street and gross margin looked a little bit light,\u201d Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said.\n\n\u201cPC was weaker in the fourth quarter than we were expecting,\u201d Rolland added.\n\nThe chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting revenue of $13.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter rose to $3.66 billion, or 74 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 27, from $2.6 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 66 cents per share on revenue of $14.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nIntel shares were down 2.7 percent in after-hours trading at $35.28, after closing on Nasdaq at $36.19.",
