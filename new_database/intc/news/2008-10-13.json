Morgan in San Francisco said demand was going \u201cstraight down the tubes.\u201d\n\nEconomists worry that the United States is heading for recession affecting demand for everything from cars and houses to television and computers.\n\nTexas Instruments TXN.N, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N, Xilinx (XLNX.O) Inc and Altera Corp (ALTR.O) also report this week or next.\n\nBut analysts are not sure that all the bad news has trickled back to the microchip makers from companies that make, sell and distribute products that use chips.\n\n\u201cWhen Intel gives guidance it may or may not have received guidance from distributors that terrible things are happening,\u201d said Brian Piccioni of BMO Capital Markets in Canada.\n\nAnd that leaves things uncertain for now.\n\n\u201cWe all want to know about 2009. They (the companies) have no idea,\u201d said Danely. \u201cThey\u2019re not that scared and wonder why people on Wall Street are.\u201d\n\nHe said stocks reflect the market\u2019s understanding that business conditions will be bad for the first half of next year, even if the companies have been slow to acknowledge it.\n\nPatrick Wang, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan, said what companies say about the end of this year will also matter. \u201cWe do need to make sure inventories remain under control,\u201d he said.\n\nProblems extend beyond the rich markets in Europe and the United States. Edwin Mok of Needham & Company in San Francisco said distributors told him there are now demand problems in the smaller Asia market and emerging markets such as Brazil.\n\nAnalysts also question whether Intel\u2019s low-end Atom processor, introduced in March, might be selling quickly -- but at the expense of more profitable chips.\n\n\u201cI expect that the unit demand will expand more than people expect, but the value of those units is probably lower,\u201d said Freedman.\n\nMok said he is awaiting confirmation from Intel of its view that growth in demand for netbooks -- a new, small class of computers that are cheaper than laptops -- \u201cis incremental, not cannibalization of the higher-end machines.\u201d\n\nFreedman said the bad economic situation will be directly reflected in Intel\u2019s non-operating income, based on investments that take a hit from lower market prices.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the last time we had problems, their non-operating income line lost several million dollars,\u201d he said, recalling the last major downturn.\n\nOn the positive side, Freedman said Intel and some other chip firms will get a boost from a research and development tax credit in the $700 billion bailout for financial institutions enacted this month.",
