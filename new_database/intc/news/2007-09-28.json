That compared to an earlier target range of $9 billion to $9.6 billion, and $8.74 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nBarrett said his company has been regaining market share from Advanced Micro Devices Inc with new products. Intel has also fought market share losses to AMD with price cuts to older products.\n\nIntel stumbled in 2005 but it started introducing chips with new designs in the middle of last year that have helped the company regain market share against its smaller rival.\n\nEarlier this month, AMD introduced a line of chips code-named Barcelona that have four cores, the main computing engines in computers, to compete with quad-core processors from Intel.\n\nWhen asked whether he had concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown, Barrett said most of Intel\u2019s business is abroad.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of our business is outside the United States ... The growth of our business is predominantly in emerging markets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dIf there was a worldwide slowdown, that would be a concern to us,\u201c Barrett said. \u201dBut most of the dialogue has been on the\n\nIntel shares closed down 15 cents, or 0.58 percent, at $25.76 on Nasdaq and AMD stock finished off 47 cents, or 3.4 percent, at $13.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.",
