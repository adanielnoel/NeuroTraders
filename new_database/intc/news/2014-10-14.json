        "body": "BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel\u2019s investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung.\n\nFor more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it\u2019s started to help the local semiconductor industry,\u201d said Nomura analyst Leping Huang.\n\nThe deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel\u2019s beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company\u2019s years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\n\nA key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal.\n\nThe agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips.\n\nChina is the world\u2019s largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co, or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan.\n\nChina\u2019s ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance program PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry.\n\nFor Intel, the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world\u2019s biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China\u2019s chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption.\n\nDeng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People\u2019s Congress, said in March that China\u2019s $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country\u2019s entire yearly petroleum imports.\n\nIn June, the State Council offered the country\u2019s most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020.\n\nAn important part of Beijing\u2019s effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq.\n\nThe two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nAs part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA.\n\nBeijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup.\n\nSince taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker.\n\nA central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek.\n\nIntel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nIn May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel\u2019s architecture.\n\n\u201cWith China, what they want is for you to be a true partner,\u201d Krzanich told reporters in September. \u201cWe go in and we partner, we build factories, we build R&D and we help local companies.\u201d\n\nIntel\u2019s deal with Tsinghua Unigroup comes three months after Qualcomm agreed to partner with Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China\u2019s largest foundry, to produce some of Qualcomm\u2019s smartphone chips.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Qualcomm will help SMIC implement its first high-end 28 nanometer manufacturing technology.\n\nIt also coincides with a year-long Chinese anti-monopoly investigation into Qualcomm. Critics say the probe unfairly targets foreign companies in order to help domestic companies, which Chinese authorities flatly deny.\n\nKrzanich first discussed ways to collaborate with the Chinese firms during a visit to Tsinghua University in April, where he and Intel China head Yang Xu met Tsinghua Holding\u2019s Xu Jinhong, Unigroup\u2019s Zhou Weiguo, Spreadtrum founder Li Liyou, who is also a Tsinghua University alumnus.\n\nHe made a second trip to Beijing, the whirlwind visit in August, after which the deal fell into place.\n\n\u201cTsinghua University is an important driving force for the development of national science and technology, and Tsinghua Holdings is a key part of that effort,\u201d Tsinghua Holdings Chief Executive Xu Jinhong told Reuters by email.\n\nXu characterized the Intel investment as \u201ca new model for cooperation between Chinese and U.S. companies in the chip industry.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say that Intel\u2019s deal will give the Santa Clara-based company a moderate boost by gaining a partner with strong relationships with local phone manufacturers.\n\nThe deal should also give Intel enough protection of its intellectual property through licensing arrangements and other conditions, said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University.",
