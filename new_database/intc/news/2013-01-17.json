        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stronger-than-expected data on housing starts and jobless claims lit a fire under stocks on Thursday, pushing the S&P 500 to a five-year high and its third day of gains.\n\nA pair of economic reports lifted investors\u2019 sentiment. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a five-year low last week and housing starts jumped last month to the highest since June 2008.\n\nStrength in the housing and labor markets is key to sustained growth and higher corporate profits, helping to bring out buyers even on a day when earnings reports were mixed.\n\nGains were tempered by weakness in the financial sector, with Bank of America (BAC.N) down 4.2 percent to $11.28 and Citigroup (C.N) off 2.9 percent to $41.24 after their results.\n\nIn other negative earnings news, shares of chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) fell 5.2 percent to $21.49 in extended-hours trading after the company forecast quarterly revenue that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations. Intel had ended the regular session up 2.6 percent at $22.68.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended at its highest since December 2007 and now sits just 5.6 percent from its all-time closing high of 1,565.15.\n\n\u201cHaving consolidated really for the last two weeks, the fact that we broke out, I think that that is sucking in quite a bit of money,\u201d said James Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 84.79 points, or 0.63 percent, at 13,596.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 8.31 points, or 0.56 percent, at 1,480.94. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 18.46 points, or 0.59 percent, at 3,136.00.\n\nBetter-than-expected earnings and revenue reported by online marketplace eBay (EBAY.O) late Wednesday helped the stock gain 2.7 percent to $54.33.\n\nIn the housing sector, PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) shares gained 4.9 percent to $20.29 and Toll Brothers Inc (TOL.N) advanced 3.1 percent to $35.99. The PHLX housing sector index .HGX climbed 2.4 percent, reaching its highest close since August 2007.\n\nSemiconductor shares .SOX rose 2 percent to the highest close in eight months.\n\nFinancials were the only S&P 500 sector to register a slight decline for the day.\n\nBank of America\u2019s fourth-quarter profit fell as it took more charges to clean up mortgage-related problems. Citigroup posted $2.32 billion of charges for layoffs and lawsuits.\n\nEnergy shares led gains on the Dow as U.S. crude oil prices jumped more than 1 percent.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp forecast current-quarter revenue that was slightly below expectations, as the personal computer industry grapples with falling sales and a fundamental shift in consumer preferences toward tablets and smartphones.\n\n\u201dIntel needs to keep investing in new plants this year, even though revenue could be flat to down over the course of 2013, he said.\n\n\u201dThey have to continue to invest in new technologies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think weakness is a buying opportunity. There are not enough catalysts to push revenues up.\u201d\n\n\u201dAt $13 billon, the capex number implies that the PC business is fine, that they need that capacity. Given that PC business isn\u2019t growing as much as before, you would have expected around a $10 billion type of range. The fact that we\u2019re $3 billion above that has got to get some investors concerned about the possibility of excess capacity.\n\n\u201dWhich is why to me that number gives us confirmation that they\u2019re planning to really ramp their foundry business this year.\n\n\u201dA lot of folks had expected Intel to really be in line or even below.\n\n\u201dRevenue guidance of kind of low single digits and GM guidance of 60 percent is about 100 bps higher than the street.\n\n\u201dIt means that we\u2019re not going to continue to slide lower. PCs really degraded over the course of 2012, and the guidance and the numbers they giving us here probably means that we\u2019ve hit the bottom, we\u2019re seeing stability, and we should start to see some growth shortly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. Intel has really not been all that accurate in their long-term forecasts. But it signifies that they feel more comfortable with the PC landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201dThere seem to be a lot of investors who thought that Intel\u2019s utilization rates would drop and that gross margins would go down with it. Seems like they\u2019re managing through this downturn pretty well.\n\n\u201dIt seems like PCs were slightly lower than we expected. It seems like they slightly under-shipped the market. They\u2019re up 7 percent in the more profitable server market.\n\n\u201dFirst quarter seems like it\u2019s going to be slightly lower than what the Street was anticipating, but we think again that\u2019s weakness in PCs, and some in servers, in the first quarter. Looks like their guidance for the year is very strong with 60 percent gross margins -- that would be up from 58 percent in Q1.\n\n\u201dIt seems like they\u2019re positive and they think they\u2019re going to grow in the low single digits. That\u2019s because we think, in the second half of 2013, we expect to see growth in the PC market.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s the best tool in Intel\u2019s toolbox: their manufacturing.\n\n\u201dThey\u2019re going to push forward and that separates them from their competitors and allows them to come out with lower-power, higher-performance processors in the future.\n\n\u201dSome of these new PCs that are coming out are innovative and can actually start taking back some high-end or $700 tablets. We think that if you get a full PC that is convertible to look like a tablet with touch, we think that\u2019s a very compelling product.\n\nThe results show that the \u201cPC industry is still around and maybe it was slightly exaggerated that the death of the PC was here.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe numbers are not worse than feared.\n\n\u201dThe Q4 beat looks like the tax rate. Gross margins came in slightly better than expected.\n\nWith regard to the higher-than expected capital expenditure forecast, \u201cthis is a company that is continuing to spend money to participate in the market. That may concern some investors.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe gross margin guidance is a little higher than people thought. That may be supporting the stock.\n\n\u201dPeople are starting to freak out about the capex.\n\n\u201dThey are making the bet this year and hoping for a big revenue lift in 2014. If you think that PCs are not growing that much anymore, then what\u2019s going to drive it?\n\n\u201cThe concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don\u2019t have enough demand to fill them, they have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe upside to EPS came from 4 points of better tax rate, so that\u2019s not necessarily the best way to beat earnings.\n\n\u201dThe revenue outlook is light. The good thing is they are looking at pretty decent margins: a couple hundred basis points for the full year. The revenue isn\u2019t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat-to-down. But remember that is the expectation of flat. That is not the delivery of flat.\n\n\u201cIf they are able to be flat, that will be great, but it is probably going to be a challenge to be flat.\u201d",
