        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading microchip maker Intel Corp will offer online training to help teachers incorporate technology into their lesson plans in a program it estimates is worth $300 million over four years.\n\nIntel made the commitment in conjunction with the Clinton Global Initiative\u2019s third annual summit, which requires attendees to commit to philanthropic projects related to areas such as global warming, health, education and poverty.\n\n\u201cWe teach teachers how to use (technology) in the classroom, not just in the areas of math and science but we train teachers how to use technology to make art, history, language or any subject more exciting to kids,\u201d Intel Chairman Craig Barrett told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.\n\nThe new program is part of Intel\u2019s annual global investment of more than $100 million in improving education in schools and universities.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, Intel posted a profit of $1.3 billion on revenue of $8.7 billion.\n\nIntel said it would work with the governments of 15 countries to develop online courses to expand the reach, and flexibility, of in-person training programs that the company has supported for seven years.\n\nAs well as in developing countries such as India and China, Intel is working on the online program with countries such as France, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nBarrett said there is a need for more qualified math and science teachers in the United States, noting that about half the engineering graduates in the country are foreign nationals. He said more scholarships and financial aid would help as the number of American high-school graduates interested in these subjects appeared to be falling.\n\n\u201cThere are more computers per kid in the United States than in any other country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were just the availability of computers, the problem would have been solved. You have to conclude it\u2019s the basic education system and the capability of teachers to teach math and science.\u201d\n\nMore than 4 million teachers have used Intel\u2019s traditional training programs for help on a wide range of subjects, from AIDS awareness to finding new sources of drinking water.\n\nIntel estimated that 1.5 million teachers would sign on to the online program, adding that forecast was conservative.",

Intel has also fought market share losses to AMD with price cuts to older products.\n\nIntel stumbled in 2005 but it started introducing chips with new designs in the middle of last year that have helped the company regain market share against its smaller rival.\n\nEarlier this month, AMD introduced a line of chips code-named Barcelona that have four cores, the main computing engines in computers, to compete with quad-core processors from Intel.\n\nWhen asked whether he had concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown, Barrett said most of Intel\u2019s business is abroad.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of our business is outside the United States ... The growth of our business is predominantly in emerging markets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dIf there was a worldwide slowdown, that would be a concern to us,\u201c Barrett said. \u201dBut most of the dialogue has been on the\n\nIntel shares closed down 15 cents, or 0.58 percent, at $25.76 on Nasdaq and AMD stock finished off 47 cents, or 3.4 percent, at $13.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.",

Its push behind short-range wireless technology Wi-Fi was a big factor in the widespread adoption of that technology.\n\nTexas Instrument TXN.N is Nokia\u2019s largest chip supplier, and it also uses STMicroelectronics (STM.PA)(STM.MI), Broadcom BRCM.O and Infineon (IFXGn.DE) as suppliers.\n\nCurrently, Nokia is not manufacturing mobile devices using Intel chips.\n\nIntel said the companies were testing interoperability across Intel\u2019s forthcoming WiMax silicon \u201cBaxter Peak\u201d for laptops and mobile Internet devices, Nokia WiMax devices and Nokia Siemens Networks\u2019 [NSN.UL] WiMax infrastructure equipment.\n\nIntel, Nokia and NSN have already started testing devices with other device makers\u2019 products, using Sprint Nextel\u2019s (S.N) laboratory in Herndon, Virginia, Intel said.
