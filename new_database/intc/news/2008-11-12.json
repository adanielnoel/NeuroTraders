First, the magnitude of the miss -- it is a lot larger than most people will have expected.\n\n\u201dAnd secondly, they\u2019re pretty much missing across the board, in every geographic region.\n\n\u201dThis is more evidence to the severity of the consumer slowdown. This looks like a big miss, and we\u2019re not that far through the quarter.\n\n\u201cYou could make the point they are looking to take advantage of an oversold market to become more conservative with their guidance. But then, they\u2019ve lowered the bar a lot. You\u2019re seeing futures reacting to this already.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s very significant. For revenue to be that far down sequentially it means consumers have basically shut down for the holidays.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s so far below what they had expected.\n\n\u201cThe company had outlined weakness in enterprise but not the consumer yet. The stock\u2019s going to sell off and all semis will sell off on this.\u201d\n\n\u201dGiven the current market and climate, it\u2019s likely to be a negative (for the stock market) in the short run. We\u2019re likely to see drops in stocks between 4 and 10 percent. In the long run, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem at all for the company. In all likelihood, this is a bump in the road and a good buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely to have a negative impact on the sector as a whole, but again it\u2019s very much short-term focused.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s been largely expected. The real question is not the extent of the cut now but how far into the adjustment cycle we are.\n\n\u201dIs the adjustment cycle taking place faster than in past cycles? How much of this cut gets the bad news out of the way?\n\n\u201dThe normal pattern is for Intel to be down 10 to 12 percent in the March quarter and now we are seeing that type of behavior in the December quarter.\n\n\u201cSo the real question that investors have ... is what is March is going to look like off of this new number.\u201d",
