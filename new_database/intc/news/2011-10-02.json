        "body": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp has agreed to acquire mobile navigation software maker Telmap, the chief executive of the Israel-based company said on Sunday.\n\nDetails of the deal were not disclosed but Israeli media said Intel is paying about $300 million to $350 million.\n\nTelmap CEO Oren Nissim declined to comment on the price and said the deal was expected to close before the end of the year.\n\nTelmap will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel, which has two plants and four development centers in Israel, and will retain its brand, management and 210 employees.\n\n\u201cThe unique thing about this transaction is that here comes a giant and says \u2018We really like what you\u2019re doing, we believe in your strategy, we want to enhance and go forward. We\u2019re not here to swallow you up,'\u201d Nissim told Reuters.\n\nTeaming up with Intel will enable Telmap to provide a \u201ctrue alternative\u201d to offerings from giants such as Nokia and Google, Nissim said.\n\n\u201cI think to a large extent that from a strategic perspective came the only company that could have come,\u201d he said of Intel.\n\nIntel expects Telmap to become much bigger and reach places it hasn\u2019t before, whether it be in Europe, Asia-Pacific or the United States, Nissim said, adding Telmap will stay in Israel but expects to recruit workers abroad.\n\nPeter Riddle, general manager of Intel\u2019s AppUp developer program, in a blog posted at AppUp\u2019s annual gathering of developers in Seattle, said the deal was a step toward expanding Intel\u2019s mobile software services capabilities.\n\n\u201cTelmap delivers great multi-platform consumer experiences every day, and we\u2019re looking forward to combining that focus and excellence with Intel\u2019s to significantly grow their business,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cBut Telmap isn\u2019t just a great consumer service provider -- with Telmap we can directly provide developers with location-based services spanning devices, operating systems and CPU architectures.\u201d\n\nTelmap, which offers location-based services to provide details on traffic data, speed cameras and local offerings, expects to post revenue of $33 million in 2011 and be profitable for the second consecutive year.\n\nIntel, the world\u2019s No. 1 chipmaker, has become a larger provider of software and services following its acquisitions of McAfee and Wind River.\n\n\u201cIn mobility Intel fully understands that consumers are after where value is being created for them, which is at software, services, content,\u201d Nissim said.\n\n\u201cMany things in mobility are happening around a person\u2019s whereabouts. A lot of application developments are being done and Intel wants to be close to that pillar,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to its core business, Telmap will open up its platform to third-party developers who will be able to enhance their applications with location-based services, Nissim said.",
