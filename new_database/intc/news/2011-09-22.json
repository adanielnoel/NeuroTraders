The brokerage had earlier forecast growth of 5 percent for the same period.\n\n\u201cCloud offerings from Apple, Amazon, Google Inc (GOOG.O) and others could be an inflexion point in the consumption, storage and delivery of multimedia content and connectivity to consumers over multiple devices,\u201d the brokerage said in a note.\n\nAfter more than a year of iPad/tablet driven uncertainty the PC market appears to be stabilizing, the brokerage added.\n\n\u201cIntel has been, and should continue to be able to offset the direct impacts (from tablets) by consistently adding new features to its processors and by cleverly segmenting the market,\u201d BofA-Merrill said.\n\nBofA-Merrill, which sees Intel gaining a foothold in the mobile space in 2012 and accelerating progress in 2013, said the chipmaker\u2019s 1-2 year lead in semiconductor processing and its experience with low-power processes is a critical differentiator.\n\nIntel shares, which have risen about 14 percent over the last month, were down 1 percent in premarket trade. They closed at $21.94 on Wednesday on Nasdaq.\n\n((saqib.ahmed@thomsonreuters.com; within US +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging saqib.ahmed.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: INTEL/RESEARCH BOFAML",
