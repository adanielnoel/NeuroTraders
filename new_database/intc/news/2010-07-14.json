        "body": "NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The shares of chip and PC makers jumped on Wednesday on strong results from global technology bellwether Intel Corp (INTC.O), pointing to potential upside for the sectors in quarterly reports due in coming weeks.\n\nPersonal computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc DELL.O, as well as networking giant Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), rose in morning trading, one day after Intel said solid demand for PCs and servers helped lift its results.\n\nThe U.S. gains extend momentum from Asia, where Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), the world\u2019s top maker of DRAM memory chips, rose 3.5 percent to a three-week high, while leading contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW) closed up 1.3 percent.\n\nAcer Inc (2353.TW), the world\u2019s No.2 PC brand, closed 6 percent higher at a two-month high.\n\n\u201cIntel has given investors that boost of confidence they need,\u201d said Angela Hsiang, an analyst at KGI Securities in Taipei. \u201cWhile there are still broad fears about the wider economy, investors were looking for an excuse to buy and Intel provided that.\u201d\n\nThe tech sector\u2019s strength defied weakness in broader markets, which were weighed down by data showing a second straight month of declining U.S. retail sales.\n\n\u201cServer strength and corporate PC refresh activities should keep the PC demand story robust into 2011 and we could look to get constructive on shares as earnings season settles out,\u201d said analyst Craig Berger of FBR Capital Markets.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the U.S. market closed, Intel, the world\u2019s largest chipmaker and a dominant supplier of PC chips, posted margin and revenue forecasts that blew past Wall Street expectations, helping lift its shares 7.1 percent in extended trading [ID:nN12197658]. Intel shares were up only about 3 percent on Wednesday on Nasdaq.\n\nDutch chip equipment maker ASML Holding NV (ASML.AS)(ASML.O) added to the optimism on Wednesday when it raised its full year sales outlook as it sees robust demand for its machines that produce chips for PCs and smartphones.\n\nIntel\u2019s outlook helped raise expectations that technology spending could remain strong, even as broader fears about the Euro zone, a jobless U.S. recovery and a cooling of Chinese growth weigh on the sector.\n\n\u201cPeople are beginning to think the second half may not be as bad as they\u2019d feared and this is boosting Toshiba Corp (6502.T) and the technology sector as a whole,\u201d said Takeo Miyamoto, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo.\n\nAsia\u2019s top technology companies such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics are likely to see revenue grow by about 35 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data, coming off a weak 2009 that was hard hit by the global financial crisis.\n\nTrading volume was strong on most counters. Some 31.9 million Acer shares changed hands in Taipei, the highest level in about six weeks. Some 663,692 Samsung Electronic shares were traded in Seoul, the highest since early May.\n\nWithin the DRAM sector, Japan\u2019s Elpida Memory Inc 6665.T rose 3.6 percent, while South Korea\u2019s Hynix Semiconductor Inc (000660.KS) rose 3.4 percent. Contract chipmakers United Microelectronics Corp (2303.TW) rose 3.1 percent.\n\nOther PC issues, including Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) and Asustek Computer Inc (2357.TW) also rallied to firmer closes.\n\n\u201cThe key now is to look at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and International Business Machines Corp\u2019s (IBM.N) earnings in the next two weeks,\u201d Hsiang said. \u201cIf those come out strong, we\u2019re probably in line for a strong rally.\u201d\n\nThe second half of the calendar year is usually the strongest season for most technology brands, as students prepare to return to school after the summer holidays and ahead of the peak year-end shopping season.\n\nDespite the buoyant mood, some analysts warned the party could be short-lived if oversupply and a faltering economy lead to a weaker pricing environment that could weigh heavily on the company margins and revenue.\n\n\u201cI remain more cautious about the third-quarter outlook as chip prices are seen weakening in the second half,\u201d said Han Seung-hoon, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.\n\nSamsung is set to report its quarterly earnings on July 30, while TSMC is due to report on July 29.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world\u2019s biggest microchip maker, handily beat second-quarter sales and profit estimates and forecast third-quarter sales well ahead of Wall Street\u2019s consensus.\n\nThe upbeat numbers from the first major U.S. technology company to report this quarter suggest that global demand for PCs and servers is continuing to recover after last year\u2019s belt-tightening.\n\nShares of the company rose 6.5 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nFollowing are initial reactions of analysts and investors:\n\n\u201cThe numbers just blew me away, I cannot see any mention of any problems whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if Europe just never happened as far as Intel is concerned. No mention of Europe, their numbers are at the high end of demand, their margins, it\u2019s like they\u2019re printing dollar bills there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one thing about Intel shares is in spite of their numbers driving it up, it tends to sort of work itself up to $24-ish or so and then just fall right back as the economy affects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect the same to happen. I would be surprised if it reached significantly north of $25. Because they still have to overcome a huge share count.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a blow out. I think it\u2019s reminding the market that basically stocks are too cheap; the market was trading Intel at a pretty compressed multiple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that they are raising capital spending is confirming this idea that capacity is tight and there\u2019s some pretty good momentum and I think it\u2019s squeezing more buyers into the market. It\u2019s going to be a data point that causes people to flip from probably extreme pessimism to extreme optimism.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemand was stronger than many people anticipated, the Street was concerned corporate spending would be restrained with what\u2019s happened in Europe and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real thing that got the Street going was the gross margin guidance, which they raised. It shows a lot of confidence that the company has for the back half of the year. If the company was at all concerned about demand, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to raise that number.\u201d\n\n\u201cTech spending was a little more healthy than expected, on the server side and consumer side. We\u2019ve seen companies start to loosen up refresh cycle budgets and expand, and that\u2019s a sign things are continuing to expand despite concerns in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a quarter where people expected relatively strong performance, they beat that pretty handily and set a good forecast. They seem unaffected by the negativity that\u2019s impacting equities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis going to be really good for a lot of other tech companies, particularly enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be the case that this earnings period is so strong that it allays some of the fears about the broader economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again gross margins were incredibly strong, showing the benefit of the operational improvements that the company has made over the last few years, plus a good product mix and a strong manufacturing performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another indication that some of the very positive server data points that you\u2019ve been hearing year to date, and some of the constructive enterprise spending data points, are seeing good validation from Intel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey beat on the top line, they beat on the bottom line, the gross margin is through the roof. It couldn\u2019t be better. I think Intel is very under priced. And the key reason everybody missed on it is -- as they\u2019ve been talking about for eight months -- cloud infrastructure is just started.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we speak to our contacts who are IT purchasers and IT suppliers, we are not seeing any slowdown. Because Europe and Asia are investing in technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither the investor community has massively under-calculated what worldwide demand is or Intel is too optimistic here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s too early to call second-half demand so far because obviously Intel is the first one to report, but obviously earnings are off to a very bullish start.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still consumer demand in growing markets. There could be potential upsides coming from corporate IT renewals.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery strong mix in product revenues and very strong revenues. People were very focused on the PC client group while the data center group -- driven by new product introduction -- was what helped lift revenues.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorporate spending for large server farms was much stronger than people had expected.\u201d",

Some are expecting Fed officials to cut their outlook for U.S. economic growth, tracking recent moves by Wall Street economists.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed declares that growth will be marked down and we won\u2019t be roaring into recovery in the second half of the year, that\u2019s going to dampen enthusiasm,\u201d said Edward Riley, chief executive of Riley Asset Management in Boston.\n\nIntel (INTC.O), a Dow component, climbed 6 percent to $22.27 in premarket trading a day after it posted better-than-expected results, allaying concerns about a slowdown in technology business spending. For details, see [ID:nN12197658]\n\n\u201cIntel indicates that the health of the tech sector in general is still extremely strong,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if after the Fed statement investors didn\u2019t refocus on that since its sufficient to support a much better stock market.\u201d\n\nWith the S&P 500 index up 8 percent from a recent intraday low on July 1, investors are scrutinizing early second-quarter earnings reports for evidence that the rally can be sustained.\n\nS&P 500 futures SPc1 fell 3 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 fell 7 points, while Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 gained 2.8 points.\n\nSales at U.S. retailers fell for a second month in June, pulled down by weak receipts at automotive dealers and gasoline stations. The report could reduce positive sentiment along with the Fed statement. [ID:nN1350097]\n\nGoldman Sachs downgraded the homebuilder and chemical sectors to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cattractive\u201d and downgraded stocks in both groups. The firm wrote that the housing recovery was occurring more slowly and said there were less inspiring trends in key chemical end markets. [ID:nSGE66D0GV] and [ID:nSGE66D0GO]\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Nokia Siemens Networks is in talks to buy the telecom-equipment arm of Motorola Inc MOT.N in a deal that could be worth $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. [ID:nN1391664] Motorola shares gained 1.1 percent in premarket trade.\n\nU.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday appeared to nail down the votes needed to approve a historic overhaul of U.S. financial regulations and set up a final vote by the end of the week.

The stock was down 3 percent to $40.48 before the bell. [ID:nN13265343] (Editing by Padraic Cassidy)",
