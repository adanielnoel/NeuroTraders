It voluntarily disclosed the sales in 2012.\n\nThe software is controlled for national security reasons, and some of the recipients in China were on the \u201cEntity List\u201d kept by the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department.\n\nPersons or organizations on that list have been identified as posing a greater risk of diversion to weapons of mass destruction programs, terrorism, or other activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.\n\nIntel shares were down about 0.6 percent at $27.91 in morning U.S. trading on the Nasdaq.",
