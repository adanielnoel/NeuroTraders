        "body": "LANGLEY, Virginia (Reuters) - CIA Director Leon Panetta said on Wednesday President Barack Obama wants to aggressively pursue Islamic militants, stressing there has been no let-up in the war despite change in the White House.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with a group of reporters, Panetta also said that as a result of the global recession, the intelligence community is now preparing a daily report on how the foreign policy of countries suffering economic instability might change.\n\nHe mentioned specifically China and Russia as well as countries in Europe and Latin America, for example Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela.\n\nThe change in administrations from Republican President George W. Bush, who aggressively went after Islamic militants, to that of Democrat Obama has raised questions in Washington as to how persistent the new president would be in the struggle to prevent a repeat of the September 11 attacks.\n\nPanetta gave his clearest sign yet that nothing has changed in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to pursue, we are going to continue to bring pressure, we are going to continue a very aggressive effort to go after terrorists, to go after (Osama) bin Laden, until we bring them to justice,\u201d Panetta said.\n\n\u201cThat is a fundamental mission that we are committed to here,\u201d he said.\n\nPanetta did not specifically mention the use of unmanned Predator drones to fire missiles at al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan, which has drawn the ire of Pakistanis.\n\nBut he stressed that operations against militants would continue unabated, saying top officials from Obama on down believe they are probably \u201cthe most effective weapon we have to try to disrupt al Qaeda.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the operational efforts that have been put in place have been successful at disrupting them, and in going after members of al Qaeda,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States, frustrated by an intensifying Afghan insurgency and what it sees as Pakistan\u2019s reluctance to tackle the spillover, stepped up the missile attacks last year.\n\nAmid a debate in Washington over whether Obama will scrap the Bush slogan \u201cwar on terror\u201d to describe the U.S.-led effort to crush al Qaeda, Panetta did not use the phrase, but said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a war ... There\u2019s no question in my mind that we are facing terrorists and we are facing a threat to this country that requires we do everything possible to protect our safety.\u201d\n\nHe expressed particular concern about Somalia and Yemen becoming safe havens for al Qaeda, saying Somalia was essentially a failed state.\n\nPanetta said the daily economic intelligence report is being produced at the request of the Obama administration and is being distributed to key decision-makers. The first one was distributed on Wednesday, he said.\n\n\u201cObviously, the purpose of that of that is to make sure we are not surprised by the implications of (the) worldwide economic crisis and what happens with countries throughout the world as a result of that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe world economic crisis has become the biggest near-term U.S. security concern, displacing terrorism, U.S. intelligence agencies told Congress this month.\n\nThe annual threat assessment produced by the Office of the Director of National intelligence said a quarter of countries around the globe had already experienced at least \u201clow-level\u201d political instability, such as government changes, linked to the economy.\n\nPanetta, who was White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, left a fairly tranquil lifestyle in California to return to Washington for the arduous task of managing the CIA.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2018m a sucker for challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked how his has changed now, he chuckled and said: \u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere without a security detail.\u201d",
