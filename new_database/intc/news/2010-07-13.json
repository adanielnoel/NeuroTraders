The chip sector has been battered by fears that economic woes in Europe will hit end-demand for PCs and concerns that semiconductor margins might have peaked amid fast-growing inventories worldwide.\n\nBut analysts now expect a rebound in technology hardware upgrades or replacements by corporations -- after a two-year spending drought -- to underpin second-half sales of higher-margin server and notebook processors.\n\nDuring the last hour of trade, options volume was 3.7 times greater than normal with about 121,000 puts and 194,000 calls traded, data from options analytics firm Trade Alert show.\n\nBelanger noted the biggest orders have been bought in the July $20 and August $21 puts.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world\u2019s biggest microchip maker, handily beat second-quarter sales and profit estimates and forecast third-quarter sales well ahead of Wall Street\u2019s consensus.\n\nThe upbeat numbers from the first major U.S. technology company to report this quarter suggest that global demand for PCs and servers is continuing to recover after last year\u2019s belt-tightening.\n\nShares of the company rose 6.5 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nFollowing are initial reactions of analysts and investors:\n\n\u201cThe numbers just blew me away, I cannot see any mention of any problems whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if Europe just never happened as far as Intel is concerned. No mention of Europe, their numbers are at the high end of demand, their margins, it\u2019s like they\u2019re printing dollar bills there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one thing about Intel shares is in spite of their numbers driving it up, it tends to sort of work itself up to $24-ish or so and then just fall right back as the economy affects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect the same to happen. I would be surprised if it reached significantly north of $25. Because they still have to overcome a huge share count.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a blow out. I think it\u2019s reminding the market that basically stocks are too cheap; the market was trading Intel at a pretty compressed multiple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that they are raising capital spending is confirming this idea that capacity is tight and there\u2019s some pretty good momentum and I think it\u2019s squeezing more buyers into the market. It\u2019s going to be a data point that causes people to flip from probably extreme pessimism to extreme optimism.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemand was stronger than many people anticipated, the Street was concerned corporate spending would be restrained with what\u2019s happened in Europe and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real thing that got the Street going was the gross margin guidance, which they raised. It shows a lot of confidence that the company has for the back half of the year. If the company was at all concerned about demand, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to raise that number.\u201d\n\n\u201cTech spending was a little more healthy than expected, on the server side and consumer side. We\u2019ve seen companies start to loosen up refresh cycle budgets and expand, and that\u2019s a sign things are continuing to expand despite concerns in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a quarter where people expected relatively strong performance, they beat that pretty handily and set a good forecast. They seem unaffected by the negativity that\u2019s impacting equities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis going to be really good for a lot of other tech companies, particularly enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be the case that this earnings period is so strong that it allays some of the fears about the broader economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again gross margins were incredibly strong, showing the benefit of the operational improvements that the company has made over the last few years, plus a good product mix and a strong manufacturing performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another indication that some of the very positive server data points that you\u2019ve been hearing year to date, and some of the constructive enterprise spending data points, are seeing good validation from Intel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey beat on the top line, they beat on the bottom line, the gross margin is through the roof. It couldn\u2019t be better. I think Intel is very under priced. And the key reason everybody missed on it is -- as they\u2019ve been talking about for eight months -- cloud infrastructure is just started.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we speak to our contacts who are IT purchasers and IT suppliers, we are not seeing any slowdown. Because Europe and Asia are investing in technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither the investor community has massively under-calculated what worldwide demand is or Intel is too optimistic here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s too early to call second-half demand so far because obviously Intel is the first one to report, but obviously earnings are off to a very bullish start.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still consumer demand in growing markets. There could be potential upsides coming from corporate IT renewals.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery strong mix in product revenues and very strong revenues. People were very focused on the PC client group while the data center group -- driven by new product introduction -- was what helped lift revenues.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorporate spending for large server farms was much stronger than people had expected.\u201d",

The heavy purchase drove premiums to jump from 32 cents to as high as 46 cents, said David Russell, options strategist at optionMonster.com.\n\nVolume surged to 19,624 contracts, more than nine times open interest in the strike. The ETF rose 3.1 percent to $36.42, up more than 13 percent from a week ago.\n\nOn the downside, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) slipped 2 percent after a poor consumer guide review for its iPhone 4 amid complaints about the device\u2019s reception. Apple was down at $252.11.[ID:nN13254388]\n\n\u201cSome of the blogs out there were speculating there was going to have to be a full iPhone 4 recall and since then they\u2019ve been defended by five houses on Wall Street,\u201d said Dave Lutz, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI think the Street is anticipating Steve Jobs doing what it takes to make it right and not have the image tarnished,\u201d said Lutz, who is long Apple.\n\nAbout 8.55 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below last year\u2019s estimated daily average of 9.65 billion.\n\nAdvancers beat decliners 2,644 to 387 on the NYSE, while on the Nasdaq, advancers beat decliners 2,244 to 442.

        "body": "* Europe not a factor in IT spending growth\n\n* Acer, Lenovo, TSMC and Samsung shares jump in Asia (Adds share prices of major Asia tech firms, analyst comments)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, July 13 (Reuters) - Resilient demand for PCs and servers helped Intel Corp\u2019s (INTC.O) margin and revenue forecasts blast past Wall Street expectations, allaying fears of a technology spending slowdown and sending its shares up nearly 8 percent.\n\nIntel\u2019s stellar results set an upbeat tone for the industry\u2019s earnings season, boosting stocks from Microsoft (MSFT.O) to Cisco (CSCO.O) and Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index futures, suggesting a strong open for Wall Street on Wednesday.\n\nThe world\u2019s top chipmaker expects a record gross margin of 67 percent for the third quarter, give or take a couple percentage points. It foresees revenue of $11.2 billion to $12 billion, surpassing analysts\u2019 target of $10.9 billion.\n\n\u201cDemand was stronger than many people anticipated. The Street was concerned corporate spending would be restrained with what\u2019s happened in Europe, and that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d said John Massey, portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management.\n\n\u201cThe real thing that got the Street going was the gross margin guidance, which they raised. It shows a lot of confidence that the company has for the back half of the year. If the company was at all concerned about demand, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to raise that number.\u201d\n\nIn Asia, investors chased shares of major technology companies following Intel\u2019s upbeat forecasts. Taiwan\u2019s Acer Inc (2353.TW), the world\u2019s No.2 PC vendor, shot up 6 percent while its Chinese rival Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) gained 4.8 percent. Both stocks hit three-week highs.\n\nSome investors worry that Europe\u2019s woes, coupled with the likelihood of decelerating growth in Asian markets such as China, will crimp IT spending just as companies begin to spend again after a two-year drought. But Intel executives said there are clear signs of renewed spending by corporations.\n\n\u201cNow that corporations have some breathing room in the economy and their budgets, you\u2019re starting to see those machines that were four or five years-old get refreshed,\u201d Intel CEO Paul Otellini said in a conference call with analysts.\n\nOtellini added channel inventory remained \u201clean\u201d, and the company is comfortable with rising internal inventories.\n\nGleacher & Co analyst Doug Freedman said new products in Intel\u2019s data center group, which makes chips for servers used by corporations, provided a big lift to Intel\u2019s top line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d expect that the enterprise market continues to be strong into the third quarter,\u201d CFO Stacy Smith told Reuters.\n\nShares in Intel rose 7.1 percent to $22.50 in extended trade. Microsoft and Cisco rose about 2 percent after-hours. Intel\u2019s arch-foe, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N, climbed 5 percent. And Texas Instruments TXN.N climbed 1.8 percent.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first quarter we\u2019ve seen the corporate buyer come in and participate,\u201d said money manager Patrick Becker Jr, principal with Becker Capital Management Inc.\n\n\u201cIt lends some credence to the theory that maybe companies aren\u2019t hiring, but they are spending money on product enhancement through systems and software,\u201d said Becker, whose company manages $2.2 billion in assets and holds 1.5 million shares of Intel.\n\nSome analysts focused on the company\u2019s rising inventories, typically a warning sign of slowing demand in the chip sector.\n\nPacific Crest Securities\u2019 Michael McConnell said Intel\u2019s 86 days of internal inventory was close to the 89 days the company held at the peak of its last business cycle.\n\nGiven the strong second-quarter demand Intel experienced, McConnell was not worried about elevated inventory levels. But he warned business conditions could shift rapidly.\n\n\u201cThis really isn\u2019t a month-to-month market, it\u2019s a week-to-week market right now with all that\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nIn Asia, Intel\u2019s results led to more upbeat views for the months ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have more confidence in the tech sector\u2019s recovery now,\u201d said Tom Tang, analyst at Masterlink Investment Advisory in Taipei.\n\n\u201cIt looks like inventory is healthy and won\u2019t be a problem in the third quarter.\u201d\n\nApart from Acer and Lenovo, top contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW)(TSM.N) also rose 1.7 percent, and South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), the world\u2019s largest maker of memory chips and displays, jumped 3.4 percent.\n\nSome analysts said the tech rebound was driven in part by over-selling, as investors reacted to second-half uncertainty.\n\nShares of Intel have slid alongside those of other chipmakers in recent months, as investors fret about a potential build-up in inventories industrywide as well as concerns about the effect of the European debt crisis.\n\nAnalysts had estimated Intel was trading at 10-11 times 2010 earnings, below the historical average of past years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reminding the market that basically stocks are too cheap,\u201d said Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global. \u201cThe fact that they are raising capital spending is confirming this idea that capacity is tight and there\u2019s some pretty good momentum,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a data point that causes people to flip from probably extreme pessimism to extreme optimism.\u201d\n\nThe company has high hopes for the launch of its Sandy Bridge processor later this year. Smith said Intel expects to move up more of its capital expenditures into this year from 2011, to prepare for that ramp-up.\n\nIntel posted net income of $2.9 billion, or 51 cents a share, versus a net loss of $398 million, or 7 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2009, when Intel\u2019s results included a $1.4 billion fine by the European Commission. Analysts had expected earnings of 43 cents per share in the second quarter.\n\nRevenue in the quarter ended June 26 was $10.8 billion, above the $10.25 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. And its gross profit margin in the second quarter was 67 percent, exceeding the 64 percent expected by analysts.\n\n\u201cIn a quarter where people expected relatively strong performance, they beat that pretty handily and set a good forecast,\u201d said Charter Equity Research analyst Edward Snyder. \u201cThey seem unaffected by the negativity that\u2019s impacting equities.\u201d (Editing by Edwin Chan and Valerie Lee)",
