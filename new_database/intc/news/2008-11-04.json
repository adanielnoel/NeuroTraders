The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was released late on Monday and did not give a reason for the sale.\n\nIntel said that it sold 500,000 shares to Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and 500,000 shares to EMC Corp EMC.N on October 30 at a price of $26.52 per share.\n\nThe chipmaker originally paid $23 per share for the stock in a private placement. VMware shares hit a record high of $125.25 on October 31, 2007, after going public in August that year at $29 per share.\n\nShares of VMware, which is majority-owned by EMC, fell nearly 4 percent before recovering to trade up 0.53 percent at $31.98 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIntel\u2019s planned Tuesday sale is equivalent to about seven times the average 90-day trading volume in VMware.\n\nOfficials with Intel and VMware could not be reached for comment.",
