The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 15.59 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,417.92.\n\nThe expectation of more cheap cash helped lift bank stocks.

The 30-day correlation between the index and the S&P 500 ticked down to -0.90.\n\nChina\u2019s bid to cool down its economy partly offset the Fed\u2019s resolve, as it sparked concerns it could crimp global growth. An official Chinese newspaper reported the government raised bank reserve requirements by 50 basis points, the fourth hike this year, due to excessive lending.\n\nThe report confirmed a Reuters story on Monday.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Intel Corp forecast a slightly stronger than expected fourth-quarter revenue and gross margin as demand from corporations and emerging markets hold up, buoying its shares in after-hours trade.\n\n\u201dThe headline looks pretty good. There was concern about Q4... and the number is better than the Street expected.\n\n\u201dThe question really is, what\u2019s the mix of business, and the margin\u2019s good, which seems to hint at better mix, and maybe a little more business on the data center and server side.\n\n\u201dWhen they talk about healthy inventory levels, other companies aren\u2019t necessarily going to be able to say the same thing. Other companies might be talking about more weakness, others might have to offer guidance below what people are expecting for Q4.\n\n\u201cIntel is seeing a benefit in their average selling price, so there\u2019s something happening positively in terms of their product mix. They are also managing costs quite well.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s kind of a little bit better than what people are expecting. There\u2019s not anything dramatic with the numbers. Nothing wildly exciting to the upside or downside.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m not sure (what) it indicates as a barometer of the economy or the holiday season. They don\u2019t have a good sense of the holiday because it hasn\u2019t started. Obviously their business isn\u2019t getting worse but it\u2019s hard to argue that the business is getting better here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe outlook is slightly less than seasonal, so expectations for lower consumer spending are being built in to the numbers. No surprise there. Lowered expectations are being met, and I would say concerns over pricing do not seem to be having the expected impact on margins or ASPs.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt looks fairly well in line with consensus, a little upside. The revenue guidance for the December quarter is about in line with the street, or a little better.\n\n\u201dThe gross margin number, up sequentially and 67 percent for Q4, is a topic the market\u2019s going to focus on. That\u2019s better than expected.\n\n\u201cI certainly think, at first glance, what we see is a little better than what we had modeled.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt looks like management seems relatively constructive regarding year-end demand. They talked about healthy worldwide demand for PC products. The guided revenue is in line with expectations but took gross margins up a bit.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they\u2019re seeing healthy tailwinds, whether it\u2019s product mix or cost structure taking margins higher. It\u2019s the first read on holiday and fourth-quarter demand and it\u2019s a relatively positive view on the market. We\u2019re going to see now how the holiday period plays out.\u201d",
