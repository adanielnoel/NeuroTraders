        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, has missed a deadline to respond to European Union charges it paid a retailer to refrain from selling computers using chips made by a rival.\n\nThe deadline for Intel\u2019s response was Oct. 17, said Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the EU Competition Commission.\n\nIntel said it did not respond because it was still waiting to hear the results of an appeal it filed related to the case.\n\nEarlier this month Intel asked the Commission for more time to respond to the charges, and Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said Monday that the company was simply seeking to expand the evidence available to the Commission for the proceeding.\n\n\u201cThis is fundamentally a fairness issue; we simply want to be able to conduct a fair defense.\u201d\n\nThe Commission issued charges against Intel in July, alleging that the company had paid a retailer to favor computers using its chips over those using chips from rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N.\n\nIntel filed an appeal in October with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.\n\nTodd said the Commission\u2019s antitrust investigation is ongoing, and that there is no deadline for its decision.\n\nShares of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel recently traded up 27 cents at $14.52, while shares of Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD fell 9 cents, or 3 percent, to $2.94.
