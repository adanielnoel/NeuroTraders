        "body": "SEOUL, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Wednesday it had filed a formal complaint to overturn an earlier South Korean antitrust ruling that found the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor maker had abused its dominant market position.\n\nIntel said in a statement its filing to the Seoul High Court asserted that the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) made substantial factual and legal errors in formulating its final opinion.\n\nThe KFTC said in June that Intel offered rebates to South Korean personal computer makers in return for their not buying microprocessors from rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N. Intel was also fined about 26 billion won ($18 million).\n\n\u201cThe KFTC failed to understand the dynamics, pricing and competition in the microprocessor market,\u201d Intel said in a statement, adding that the South Korean regulator either misinterpreted or ignored evidence of benefits to consumers from cheaper, improved Intel chips.\n\nIntel denies \u201cartificial price protection,\u201d but \u201ccompetes aggressively,\u201d said Nick Jacobs, an Intel spokesman.\n\nThe KFTC declined to comment. It said in June Intel\u2019s rebates limited the choices of domestic PC makers in selecting business partners and forced local consumers to buy PCs at higher prices.\n\nIntel is also facing competition charges from the European Commission and an antitrust investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
