(bloom.bg/1ykDar1)\n\nSome other large investors also have also sent letters, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nReuters reported last week discussions on a takeover of Altera by Intel had ended as the companies were unable to agree on price.\n\nIntel\u2019s offer was in the neighborhood of the low-$50 per share range, CNBC reported on April 9.\n\nAltera\u2019s shares closed at $43.86 on Monday, valuing the company at $13.2 billion. The stock has surged nearly 27 percent since merger talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal in March.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Cadian was Altera\u2019s 10th-largest shareholder, with a 2.77 percent stake, according to Reuters data.\n\nTIG owns about 1.5 percent of Altera\u2019s outstanding shares, one of the people told Bloomberg.\n\nAltera declined to comment. Intel, Cadian Capital and TIG were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting By Lehar Maan and Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",
