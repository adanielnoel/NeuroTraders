        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will continue to invest in products and technologies even though it sees that a U.S. financial meltdown is likely to affect the emerging markets that are crucial for its growth, its chairman said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019d have to be prudent and assume that if the financial marketplace melts down there\u2019s going to be some impact but nobody\u2019s predicting that, nobody knows how big it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Chairman Craig Barrett told Reuters journalists.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we can do is look at that part of our future destiny that we can control, and that\u2019s our investment in the future, in the products we create and the technologies we create,\u201d he said on a visit to Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had the attitude that you have to make that investment in good times and bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s R&D, capital, marketing-intensive, and we\u2019re just like a blind greyhound, we just continue to race down the track.\u201d\n\nOf its $38.3 billion 2007 revenue, the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker spent $5.8 billion on research and development and $5 billion on capital items such as property, plants and equipment.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t save your way out of a recession, you have to invest your way out, and so we\u2019ve always kept a rainy day plan to accommodate that,\u201d Barrett said, adding that Intel had a financial cash cushion of about $10 billion for that purpose.\n\nBarrett said Intel\u2019s creditworthiness meant it should be able to make acquisitions if the chance arose, even given the current turmoil in financial markets.\n\nIntel has an A+ credit rating from Standard and Poor\u2018s.\n\n\u201cIf there were an opportunity to make a strategic investment we\u2019d probably have that capability. We are probably as far from a highly leveraged investment bank as you can find,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost of the U.S. high-tech industry is in that same category -- Microsoft (MSFT.O), Cisco (CSCO.O), HP (HPQ.N), Intel -- they\u2019re in that same category.\u201d\n\nBarrett said Intel\u2019s market share in microprocessors -- its chips power about eight of every 10 PCs sold -- would rule out certain types of acquisition: for example, it would be unlikely to be allowed to buy graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA.O).\n\nBut in non-core areas such as mobile broadband, low-power chips for handhelds, high-performance chips and digital medical electronics, Intel could use acquisitions to boost its share of the market.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s opportunity for growth in the company and you could certainly consider acquisitions in some of those areas,\u201d he said.\n\nBarrett added that he saw demand for medical technology continuing to rise in all parts of the world, despite the economic downturn.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., healthcare costs on an annual basis go up about $200 billion a year, which is more than an Iraq war,\u201d he said, \u201cand Europe, I think, is not far behind us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn emerging economies, it\u2019s healthcare delivery itself which is the issue,\u201d added Barrett, who promotes health and education projects in the United States and developing countries through positions in organizations including the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThe whole world has to turn in that direction. I don\u2019t see it stopping because Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers etc. are going into demise,\u201d he said.\n\nBarrett added that a $700 billion rescue plan for the U.S. financial industry -- which was rejected by U.S. lawmakers on Monday -- was symptomatic of a lack of long-term perspective on the part of the government.\n\n\u201cWe can send out $160 billion of $500 cheques to stimulate the economy, we have a $300 billion agricultural bill which is subsidizing the industries of the 19th century, and now we\u2019re going to have a $700 billion bail-out of the finance industry,\u201d said Barrett.\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t find $1 billion to invest for the future. That\u2019s kind of misplaced priorities from my perspective.\u201d",
