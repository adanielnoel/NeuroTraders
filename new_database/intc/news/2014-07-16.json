        "body": "(Reuters) - Intel Corp\u2019s shares rose as much as 7 percent to a decade-high, after the world\u2019s largest chipmaker forecast quarterly revenue above analysts\u2019 estimates on demand from companies looking to replace old PCs.\n\nAt least 19 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock to $29-$45, while two brokerages raised their ratings to an equivalent of \u201cbuy\u201d.\n\nThe broker actions came after Intel forecast on Tuesday third-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate.\n\nChief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters that PC sales had stabilized, easing fears about the four-year decline in computer sales as consumers turn increasingly to tablets and smartphones.\n\nIntel also raised its share buyback program by $20 billion.\n\n\u201cThe company is showing clear growth in its PC segment and acceleration in data center growth, suggesting, we think, better growth potential in Intel\u2019s end markets than many investors expect,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note.\n\nSusquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Caso, however, said it would be tough to sustain the near-term strength in PC and data center demand. He maintained his \u201cneutral\u201d rating on the stock.\n\nOf the 46 analysts covering Intel, 18 have a \u201cbuy\u201d or equivalent rating on the stock, while 23 have a \u201chold\u201d or equivalent rating.\n\nIntel\u2019s shares were up 6.5 percent at $33.78 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. The stock has gained more than 32 percent in the 12 months to Tuesday\u2019s close.",
