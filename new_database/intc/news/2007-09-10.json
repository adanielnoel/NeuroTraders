        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Monday raised its third-quarter revenue forecast and said gross margins would be at the high end of its target range, citing stronger-than-expected global demand for computing products.\n\nThe news underscored recent investor confidence in technology stocks, which have emerged as a safe haven amid troubles in the U.S. credit and mortgage markets.\n\nShares of Intel, the world\u2019s largest microchip company, were up 0.75 percent at $25.66, after rising as much as 2.9 percent earlier on the Nasdaq. The stock has risen about 25 percent this year, whereas chief rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc <AMD.N has fallen more than 35 percent.\n\nPrinceton Tech Research analyst Paul Leming said Intel\u2019s bullish forecast suggests the personal computer market has fared well in recent weeks despite concerns about consumer confidence due to troubles in the credit and housing markets.\n\n\u201cA portion of this certainly is market share gains momentum continuing to move over to Intel, and, secondarily, I think this has some positive things to say about the state of the PC market in the important back-to-school season,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel raised its forecast for third-quarter revenue to between $9.4 billion and $9.8 billion, from its previous range of $9.0 billion to $9.6 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected revenue to be about $9.38 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nIntel, which is scheduled to report its third-quarter results on October 16, also said it expects its gross margin in the quarter to be in the upper half of its previous range of \u201c52 percent plus or minus a couple of points.\u201d\n\nIntel\u2019s gross margin had missed its target in the second quarter, coming in at 46.9 percent instead of its forecast of 48 percent.\n\nThe announcement came on the same day Advanced Micro Devices introduced its next-generation microprocessor, code-named Barcelona, in a long-awaited bid to win market share from Intel.\n\nAMD shares were up 1.11 percent at $12.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIntel has regained ground against its smaller rival in the last two years as it has introduced its own new processor with what it calls a quad-core design, a chip that has four central processing engines.\n\nSeparately, traders in Germany said there was market talk that AMD was planning to bid for Infineon AG\u2019s (IFXGn.DE) Qimonda AG QI.N QI1Ay.DE memory-chip affiliate.\n\nOne trader said AMD plans to offer $16.95 for each share of Qimonda; the stock was up 2.45 percent to $12.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. Infineon, Qimonda and AMD\u2019s German unit declined to comment on the market talk. Infineon holds 86 percent of Qimonda.\n\nThe Princeton Tech analyst said he did not think AMD would want to buy Qimonda.\n\n\u201cNot only does it make no sense to me, it would very much be an outright negative to see AMD move into what is the low end from the quality, margin and capital intensity (positions),\u201d Leming said.",
