[ID:N11136922]\n\nThe Nikkei also received support after Japanese core machinery orders unexpectedly jumped 10 percent in August. [JPMORD=ECI]\n\n\u201cThe market recovered some ground after Japanese stocks fared much worse than overseas markets yesterday due to the strong yen. It also received some positive impact from Intel\u2019s earnings,\u201d said Masaru Hamasaki, senior strategist at Toyota Asset Management.\n\n\u201cBut after dollar/yen fell below 82 yen, a growing consensus in the market is that the yen will probably continue to advance little by little and that has sparked worries about the outlook for corporate earnings.\u201d\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei .N225 ended up 14.87 points at 9,403.51. On Tuesday, it fell 2.1 percent in its biggest daily loss in a month.\n\nIntel\u2019s forecasts raised hopes that the technology sector could end 2010 on a strong note, pushing up chip-related shares, though Hamasaki noted that the impact on the overall market was limited because it was not as if the company revised up their earnings outlooks.\n\nChip-gear maker Tokyo Electron Ltd (8035.T) gained 1.3 percent to 4,550 yen, while Nikon Corp (7731.T) rose 0.9 percent to 1,599 yen and Yokogawa Electric Corp (6841.T) climbed 2.6 percent to 599 yen.\n\nStill, the Nikkei struggled to post strong gains due to the strength of the yen.\n\nThe dollar gained 0.2 percent to 81.86 yen JPY=, not far away from a 15-year low of 81.37 struck on Monday, though it was supported by nervousness that Japanese authorities could intervene the closer it gets to its record low of 79.75 yen.\n\nFinance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said in parliament that he could not answer whether or not Japan would conduct intervention. [FRX/]\n\nU.S. stocks hit fresh 5-month highs on Tuesday as details from the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting showed the U.S. central bank may once again flood markets with cheap cash \u201cbefore long\u201d to further boost growth. [.N]\n\nThe currency market has become very short dollars on QE expectations.\n\nOn the technical front, the Nikkei was expected to be supported by positive signals.\n\nThe Nikkei faces strong support at the 38.2 percent retracement of its September-October rally and its 55-day moving average, both of which come in around 9,365.\n\nElliott Wave analysis shows the Nikkei could rally to 10,000 as long as it holds above 9,311.\n\nWith Japan\u2019s earnings season getting into full swing later this month, earnings stories have started to drive stock prices.\n\nShares of Best Denki Co 8175.T surged 11 percent to 222 yen after the operator of consumer electronics stores lifted its full-year operating profit forecast by 30 percent as Japan\u2019s hottest summer in a century helped sales of air conditioners.\n\nBut Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co (5423.T) shed 5.4 percent to 921 yen after Japan\u2019s biggest construction steel maker revised its six-month parent operating forecast down to a 1.5 billion yen loss from a 1.7 billion yen profit.\n\nTokyo Steel had to raise prices on all products in September to pass on higher steel scrap costs.\n\nFast Retailing (9983.T) extended falls made since the operator of the Uniqlo discount clothing chain forecast its first profit fall in four years, shaking investor confidence in one of the few Japanese retailers thought to have strong growth prospects.\n\nThe stock fell 2.4 percent to 10,910 yen, after losing 9.8 percent on Tuesday. [ID:nTOE69B038]\n\nSome 1.89 billion shares changed hands on the Tokyo exchange\u2019s first section, down from a five-month high of 2.88 billion booked last Wednesday.\n\nDeclining stocks outnumbered advancers, 892 to 604.
