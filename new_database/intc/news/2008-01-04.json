It is likely to have other projects this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said there will be many solutions. The most important priority is to serve the need,\u201d he said",

That was then followed by the further extension on Friday.\n\nThe Commission is the EU\u2019s antitrust watchdog and has powers to fine companies up to 10 percent of their global annual revenues for competition abuses.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of semiconductor companies fell sharply on Friday, led by Intel Corp (INTC.O) after JPMorgan downgraded the stock on concern over slowing demand from personal-computer makers.\n\nIntel was down $1.73, or 7 percent, at $22.94 in midday trading on Nasdaq after shedding as much as much as 7.5 percent. Concerns over slowing economic growth weighed broadly on U.S. stocks as new data showed weak U.S. job growth in December.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely downgraded Intel to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight,\u201d saying Intel experienced a late-quarter slowdown in order rates from PC makers, \u201cwhich we believe negated the upside we believed Intel experienced earlier\u201d in the fourth quarter.\n\nDanely, in a note to clients, cited weakness in PC orders in Europe after Acer Inc (2353.TW), the world\u2019s fourth-largest PC maker, and British electronic-goods retailer DSG International Plc DSGI.L cut sales estimates due to lower-than-expected demand in Europe.\n\nThe 18-member Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slumped more than 4 percent, with Intel competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N falling 7.4 percent to $6.27 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nDell Inc DELL.O, the world\u2019s second-largest PC maker and one of Intel\u2019s biggest customers, fell 5.6 percent, and No. 1 Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) shed 2.7 percent.",
