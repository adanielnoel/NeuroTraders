        "body": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc\u2019s (NFLX.O) aggressive push into international markets won more customers than the video streaming service and its investors expected last quarter, sending its shares surging 7 percent.\n\nThe dominant online video company said on Tuesday it had 74.8 million subscribers at the end of December and forecast 6.1 million more through March, fueled by its expansion this month into virtually every country except China, where it is exploring ways to launch its service.\n\nThe projection is more bullish than the 4.94 million average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet StreetAccount.\n\nShares of Netflix rose 7 percent to $115.42 in after-hours trading.\n\nNetflix, which started sending DVDs to customers by mail two decades ago, now offers its subscribers unlimited online access to TV shows and movies from Hollywood studios plus its own original shows such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d\n\nNew customers overseas are countering slowing growth for Netflix in the United States, the company\u2019s biggest market. It added 1.56 million U.S. subscribers in the fourth quarter, below the 1.65 million it forecast, and less than 1.9 million a year earlier.\n\n\u201cOur high penetration in the U.S. seems to be making net additions harder than in the past,\u201d the company said in a quarterly letter to shareholders.\n\nNetflix said it expects U.S. subscribers to jump 1.75 million this quarter. The company will likely benefit from the return of hit show \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and a traditional bump in interest at the start of the year from people with new TV sets.\n\nInternationally, Netflix added 4.04 million subscribers, compared with its estimate of 3.50 million. Netflix does not break down where its international subscribers are based.\n\nFrom January through March, the company expects to add about 4.35 million international subscribers.\n\n\u201cThe rollout in 130 countries in early January ensures that they will have no problem hitting their international target,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.\n\nNetflix said it may be able to start a service in China this year, but it may take longer. \u201cWe have work and uncertainty ahead,\u201d the company said in its investor letter. \u201cOur expectations are modest and long-term.\u201d\n\nNetflix said revenue rose 22.8 percent to $1.82 billion in the December quarter. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nExcluding items, Netflix earned 7 cents per share, ahead of analysts\u2019 average estimate of 2 cents per share.",
