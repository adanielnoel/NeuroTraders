        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Netflix\u2019s valuation outstrips its burgeoning opportunity. The $87 billion video-streaming service hit another all-time high on Monday, benefiting in part from Comcast and AT&T recently warning of a fall in subscribers. Pay-TV customers cutting the cord should mean more viewers for Netflix. But even that and a fee hike last month don\u2019t justify it trading at a sky-high multiple.\n\nThe company led by Reed Hastings added 5.3 million new subscribers in its third quarter, taking its total tally around the world to 109 million customers. That beat the 4.5 million analysts had been expecting. That was after the company\u2019s shares closed at a record $202.68 a piece on Monday, making the firm worth more than Time Warner.\n\nAiding the run-up is the expected bloodbath in pay-TV subscriptions. Last week AT&T admitted it would lose 90,000 customers in the three months to the end of September as they abandoned its video product because of competition and hurricanes. Rival Comcast had earlier raised a similar yellow flag.\n\nThe specter of people ditching expensive cable packages is fast becoming a frightening reality. Pay-TV subscriptions are forecast to decline 3.4 percent in the third quarter, even faster than the bruising 2.7 percent drop in the previous three months, according to MoffettNathanson.\n\nTraditional media companies like Walt Disney are only now contemplating launching their own direct-to-consumer packages. Netflix has the first-mover advantage, having offered streaming video for a decade. Other similar products that CBS and HBO offer have fewer than 5 million subscribers each, just a fraction of the customer base Hastings has built.\n\nTrouble is, Netflix now trades at almost 40 times 2020 earnings. That looks like a work of fiction as it is. But the company also carries sizable risk. Hastings has, for example, pledged up to $8 billion for TV shows and movies next year compared to $5 billion in 2016. He\u2019s also trying to ramp up the amount of content the company can produce in-house to replace licensing third-party shows that currently soak up most of the budget. That suggests Netflix will be burning through cash for a long time yet.\n\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc added more subscribers than expected around the world in the third quarter and projected growth in line with Wall Street forecasts, saying it had a head start on rivals as internet television explodes globally.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s leading online video streaming service touched a record high on Monday and rose a further 1.2 percent after hours to $205.07. They are up about 64 percent this year.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix added 5.3 million subscribers in all its markets, compared with Wall Street\u2019s target of 4.5 million, according to FactSet. Netflix forecast 6.3 million additions for the current quarter, just above analysts\u2019 average estimate of 6.25 million, which would bring its global customer base to nearly 115.6 million.\n\nThe company known for original TV shows such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is spending heavily to produce and acquire content as it races to dominate streaming television in international markets, which now account for the majority of its subscriber growth.\n\nIn its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix said it would boost its content budget to between $7 billion and $8 billion in 2018.\n\n\u201cAs we move into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing operating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the rest of the world,\u201d the letter said.\n\nInvestors have been bullish on Netflix\u2019s ability to keep signing up customers around the world despite new rivals. Netflix recently traded at 101 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus Amazon.com Inc at 144 times earnings and Time Warner Inc at 16 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nThe company faces increasing competition from streaming services such as Amazon.com\u2019s Prime Video, plus moves by traditional media companies. Walt Disney Co decided to yank its first-run movies from Netflix in the United States starting in 2019, and to launch its own online offering.\n\nNetflix, in its investor letter, said Disney\u2019s decision underlined the need to keep building its slate of exclusive original content. \u201cWe have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible,\u201d the company said.\n\nBut Hastings said on a webcast it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that Netflix would bid on The Weinstein Company if the opportunity arose. The film production company is in talks to sell the bulk of its assets to Colony Capital following the firing of co-founder Harvey Weinstein.\n\nNetflix distributes some Weinstein Company movies and TV shows on its streaming service but the business is not material, Netflix Chief Creative Officer Ted Sarandos said on the webcast.\n\nNetflix\u2019s 5.3 million additional subscribers in the third quarter included 4.45 million in international markets and 850,000 in the United States. Wall Street had expected 4.5 million overall, with 3.69 million overseas and 810,000 in the United States, according to FactSet.\n\nRevenue rose about 30 percent to $2.99 billion in the third quarter.\n\nNet income rose to $130 million, or 29 cents per share, in the latest quarter from $52 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.",
