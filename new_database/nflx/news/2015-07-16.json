        "body": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) added nearly a third more subscribers than expected in the second quarter, sending its shares up 9.4 percent as the video streaming service said its investment in original television programs and movies was paying off.\n\nNet subscriber additions rose about 94 percent year over year to about 3.3 million in the second quarter, beating the company\u2019s forecast of 2.5 million.\n\nThe distributor of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d said its new original shows were drawing customers faster than it had forecast.\n\nNetflix also is aggressively expanding around the world, accounting for the bulk of new subscriptions. A trend of slowing U.S. growth was halted in the quarter as the number of new U.S. customers rose about 50 percent higher than the company had forecast.\n\nThe company by the end of 2016 plans to reach 200 countries, including China, where it said it was \u201ccontinuing to explore options.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubscriber growth was huge domestically and internationally,\u201d said FBR Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett. \u201cThe technology, the breadth of content and the quality of content is really working in their favor.\u201d\n\nThe company, which approved a 7-for-1 stock split in June, added 2.4 million customers in international markets in the quarter, taking its total to more than 65 million users worldwide.\n\nNetflix forecast adding about 1.2 million customers in the United States in the current quarter.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) Chief Executive Reed Hastings said it was possible the movie and TV streaming service\u2019s planned entry into China might be delayed beyond the company\u2019s goal of 2016.\n\nNetflix is aggressively moving into new markets and aims to reach 200 countries by the end of 2016. The company reported Wednesday its global subscriber base had grown to more than 65 million, beating its own forecast and sending shares up more than 9 percent.\n\nOn a conference call on Wednesday, Hastings was asked if the company might miss its target for completing a global rollout in all of its new markets by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cSo China, again, we still have some things to figure out, so I suppose it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, but added he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d about the rest of the world.\n\nThe biggest hurdle, Hastings said in an interview, is securing the required government clearance and partnerships needed to operate in China, a country with strict regulation of media.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to or exploring a number of different options for offering Netflix in China,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cUntil you get the wide range of government permissions that you need, you don\u2019t know until you\u2019ve gotten them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the content,\u201d Hastings added. \u201cWe will be ready to go then. We are confident consumers will like the service.\u201d\n\nThe company plans a \u201cmodest\u201d streaming service in China, Hastings has said.\n\nThis quarter, Netflix is introducing its service in Japan, which Hastings said was \u201cvery brand sensitive\u201d and would be among the slowest markets to penetrate.\n\n\u201cBut it may be one of our best markets in the long term because when the Japanese society embraces a brand it is a very deep connection,\u201d Hastings said on the conference call.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re willing to make that investment knowing that it\u2019s not the quick route to success that might be in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nNetflix will move into Spain, Italy and Portugal in the fourth quarter. No other new markets are planned for this year, Hastings said.",
