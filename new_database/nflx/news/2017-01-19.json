        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Financially speaking, Netflix has come to embody the title of one of its new hit shows: \u201cStranger Things.\u201d The video-streaming service blew past quarterly subscriber expectations, as it celebrated a decade of being online. After burning through still more cash, its share price soared to a new high. Apparently growth can come at almost any cost.\n\nThe $57 billion company led by Reed Hastings added 7.1 million new customers after many initially blanched at a price increase last year. Both in the United States and internationally, Netflix surpassed its own forecast, tallying nearly 94 million for the quarter ending Dec. 31.\n\nIt was 10 years ago that Hastings disrupted his own groundbreaking DVD mailing service by making the big bet that people would watch movies and TV shows using an internet connection instead. That first-mover advantage helped initiate the so-called cord-cutting and cord-never movements.\n\nNetflix just reached another significant milestone, too. Four years ago is when it started investing billions of dollars to produce its own series like \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d The original programming accounted for five of the top 10 most searched TV shows in the world, according to Google. It also has inspired Amazon and others to give chase.\n\nThe impressive expansion comes at a bigger and bigger price, however. Netflix generated negative free cash flow of $639 million in the fourth quarter, an increase from $506 million in the previous quarter and $276 million a year earlier. Netflix also is anticipating negative free cash flow of about $2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.7 billion last year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it leaves the power of scale unclear. For the extra $2 billion in revenue that Netflix reaped between 2015 and 2016, it produced just $74 million of additional operating income. Even so, the company\u2019s stock took another one of its trademark jumps, vaulting 8 percent in after-hours trading following the results on Wednesday, and is now valued at more than 140 times earnings. It is the stuff of investment science fiction.\n\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Both reported quarterly results earlier in the day.\n\nThe Dow ended lower for the fourth day in a row. The frenetic post-election rally in U.S. equities has slowed in recent weeks as investors wait for Trump to work on his campaign promises. Investors hope to get more insight following his inauguration on Friday.\n\n\u201cYou might see people taking a break here and moving to the sidelines just to see what type of shape the environment takes as far as policy,\u201d said Michael O\u2018Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed down 22.05 points, or 0.11 percent, to 19,804.72, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 4 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,271.89 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 16.93 points, or 0.31 percent, to 5,555.65.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM.O) rose 1.5 percent, helping boost the Nasdaq after Morgan Stanley said in a note the U.S. government may be reluctant to pursue an antitrust case against the company.\n\nAfter the bell, shares of Netflix (NFLX.O) jumped 8 percent following its results, which showed international and U.S. subscriber additions well above analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nThe pace of corporate results is expected to pick in the coming days. Analysts expect earnings from S&P 500 companies grew 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter, which would be the biggest profit growth for the group in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nDuring the regular session, shares of Target (TGT.N) fell 5.8 percent after the brick-and-mortar chain reported dismal results for the holiday season and cut its quarterly earnings forecast. The S&P retail index .SPXRT was down 0.4 percent.\n\nAmong other decliners, UnitedHealth (UNH.N) was off 1.8 percent at $157.74 a day after reporting results.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 27 new lows.\n\nAbout 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, slightly above the 6.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.",
