        "body": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc made a bullish forecast for subscriber additions by mid-year, a positive sign for its push to expand around the world that sent its shares toward an all-time high.\n\nThe streaming video company pushed back the next season of its smash-hit \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and other programing to the second quarter, meaning it lured in fewer new subscribers in the first quarter than expected, but will likely make it up from April through June.\n\nSubscriber rolls, the most closely watched measure of Netflix\u2019s growth, rose by just under 5 million globally in the first quarter, behind analysts\u2019 projection of 5.18 million, according to FactSet StreetAccount.\n\nHowever, Netflix forecast 3.2 million more in the seasonally slow second quarter, well ahead of analysts\u2019 estimate of nearly 2.4 million.\n\nIts shares dropped as much as 3 percent in after-hours trading before rebounding to gain 1.3 percent. The late rise put Netflix stock on track to open at a record high on Tuesday.\n\nA decade after shaking up Hollywood by delivering TV shows and movies over the internet, the company said it expects to top 100 million global subscribers this weekend.\n\nNetflix has expanded around the world over the last few years, betting that its U.S. formula would pay off in other countries. Opening in new markets and creating shows in additional languages was an expensive proposition.\n\nChief Executive Reed Hastings urged investors to look at its growth over time rather than quarter-by-quarter fluctuations.\n\n\u201cWe definitely see a big opportunity around the world,\u201d Hastings said in an interview with analysts that was posted on YouTube.\n\nIn its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix asked investors to judge its future success by looking primarily at revenue growth and global operating margins.\n\nThat would be a shift for Wall Street, which has focused on subscriber numbers, said Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin.\n\n\u201cThe minute you actually pivot (investors) to an income statement, you\u2019re talking to a completely different kind of investor,\u201d Martin said. \u201cAnd that investor demands profitability. So it\u2019s a risky business.\u201d\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-based company said net income rose to $178 million, or 40 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 6 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Wall Street had expected 37 cents per share.\n\nRevenue rose 35 percent to $2.64 billion in the quarter.\n\nThe earnings beat was due to the change in timing of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d which helped push costs into the second quarter, boosting operating margins from January through March and reducing them in the second quarter.\n\nFor the quarter that ended March 31, Netflix added 3.53 million subscribers outside the United States. (bit.ly/2puJ1Yt) Analysts on average had estimated 3.68 million additions, according to research firm FactSet.\n\nIn the United States, the company added 1.42 million subscribers, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of 1.50 million.\n\nUp to Monday\u2019s close, Netflix\u2019s stock had risen nearly 19 percent in 2017, outperforming the roughly 5 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 index.",

In Indonesia, a country of 250 million people, Netflix ran afoul of the film censorship board last year for carrying content deemed inappropriately violent or sexual.\n\nThe communications ministry of Indonesia, home to the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, had also demanded that Netflix set up a office in the country and pay local taxes.\n\nWhile state-controlled Telkom had blocked Netflix, the service was still available in Indonesia via WiFi connections and other carriers.\n\nTelkom is now negotiating a partnership agreement with Netflix and hopes to complete the process next month, Arif Prabowo, vice president for corporate communication at Telkom, said in a text message.\n\nTelkom was previously concerned that Netflix carried \u201ccontent that has a negative element\u201d, Prabowo said.\n\n\u201cIf we work together, that means we would know and can be responsible for the content broadcast by Netflix.\u201d\n\nTeaming up with Netflix would expand Telkom\u2019s content offering, Prabowo added. \u201cThe choices for our customers will be more varied.\u201d",
