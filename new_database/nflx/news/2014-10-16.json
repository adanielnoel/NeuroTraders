        "body": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc signed up fewer video streaming subscribers than forecast for the quarter that ended in September as its U.S. growth slowed markedly, sending its shares plunging as much as 27 percent.\n\nThe company blamed a $1 price hike to $8.99 a month for discouraging new sign-ups. It lured 3.02 million new streaming customers globally, versus the 3.69 million it projected in July.\n\nNetflix attracted about 980,000 new customers in the United States, its largest market, down from 1.29 million in the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe news came after Time Warner Inc\u2019s HBO said on Wednesday it will offer new competition next year with a streaming service that does not require a pay TV subscription.\n\n\u201cYear-on-year net additions in the U.S. were down,\u201d Netflix said in a quarterly letter to shareholders. \u201cAs best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago.\u201d\n\nShares of Netflix fell 25 percent to $333.53 in after-hours trading, from their $448.59 close on Nasdaq.\n\nNetflix, waving off fears that a standalone HBO would draw users away, argued that many will subscribe to both services because they offer different shows.\n\n\u201cIt is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV,\u201d the company\u2019s letter said.\n\nChief Executive Reed Hastings said in an interview that he expected other premium channels such as Showtime and Starz to sell programming directly to consumers. CBS-owned Showtime said it was weighing such a move. Starz has announced plans to offer that type of service overseas.\n\nNetflix has invested in original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d to compete with HBO, Amazon.com Inc and on-demand offerings from pay TV providers.\n\nNetflix also is pushing into original movies, financing four Adam Sandler films and a sequel to martial-arts drama \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\u201d\n\nThe HBO news, overall stock market weakness, and the subscriber forecast miss likely sparked the share selloff, Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst. But he said Netflix has proven it can bounce back from disappointing quarters.\n\n\u201cThey have got a good track record in growing past this turbulence,\u201d said Ernst, who rates Netflix a \u201cbuy.\u201d\n\nThe company forecast it will add 4 million streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter.\n\nNetflix expanded into six European countries in September.\n\nIts international subscribers grew 72 percent to 15.84 million from a year earlier.\n\nNet income rose to $59.3 million, or 96 cents per share, from $31.8 million, or 52 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts had expected profit of 93 cents per share on revenue of $1.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.",
