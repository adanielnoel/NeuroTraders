A second season came in 2013, and both were added on Netflix in 2014, quickly finding a U.S. audience.\n\nThe new season debuts with \u201cNosedive,\u201d in which Bryce Dallas Howard plays a woman trying to get digital \u201clikes\u201d in a society where everyone is constantly rated on a social app.\n\nIn \u201cPlaytest,\u201d a traveler finds himself in a terrifying immersive experience; two women connect in a peculiar town in \u201cSan Junipero\u201d; a young boy is threatened into a dangerous game in \u201cShut up and Dance\u201d; a soldier faces turmoil in \u201cMen Against Fire\u201d and in \u201cHated in the Nation,\u201d the internet\u2019s most disliked people are mysteriously killed.\n\nThe show \u201ctouches on a lot of themes but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever a resounding moral,\u201d said producer Annabel Jones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re often very ambiguous and sometimes the endings are quite gray, which I think sometimes is quite unsettling for people,\u201d she said.\n\nBrooker and Jones said partnering with Netflix garnered them bigger budgets and no restrictions on episode lengths, unlike shows made for broadcast television.\n\nBrooker said each of the new episodes take on a different genre, such as \u201cHated in the Nation\u201d serving as the \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d take on a Scandinavian detective noir, and \u201cPlaytest\u201d exploring the horror realm.\n\nIt is a structure that Brooker said they will continue as they work on season 4, in which one episode will focus on parenting.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m not anti-technology, but I\u2018m a neurotic worrier and it amuses me, or liberates me in a way to think of worst case scenarios,\u201d Brooker said with a laugh.",
