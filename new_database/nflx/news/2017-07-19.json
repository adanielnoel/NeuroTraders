Bank of America fell 1.3 percent and dragged the S&P.\n\nLast week, shares of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup had taken a beating after their quarterly results and forecasts failed to excite investors.\n\nThe S&P healthcare sector also came under scrutiny, after the healthcare bill to replace Obamacare sank in the Senate, as Republicans remained divided on how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe failure of the bill spelled uncertainty for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda of tax reform and an infrastructure overhaul, leaving the president without any major legislative accomplishments six months into his tenure.\n\n\u201cThe healthcare bill not coming through raises some continued concerns about the ability of Washington to push through favorable fiscal policies,\u201d said Lisa Kopp, head of traditional investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n\nNews about the bill\u2019s collapse sent the U.S. dollar to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies.\n\nAt 12:44 p.m. ET (1644 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 83.9 points, or 0.39 percent, at 21,545.82, the S&P 500 was down 2.3 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,456.84.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 10.41 points, or 0.16 percent, at 6,324.84.\n\nSix of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the telecommunications and financial sectors leading the decliners.\n\nThe market will be keeping a close eye on corporate results to see if high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington.\n\n\u201cWith valuation where they are, it is really important for earnings to come through for the market to retain their momentum and push upwards,\u201d said Kopp.\n\nAnalysts are estimating an 8.2 percent rise in second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 companies from a year earlier.\n\nThis follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted their best earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nHarley-Davidson fell 8.6 percent after the motorcycle maker cut its 2017 shipments forecast.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill was down 6 percent, after a report the burrito chain shut a restaurant following complaints of severe illness from several diners.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,656 to 1,139.

The movie streaming company rose 13.5 percent to $183.60 a day after it crushed Wall Street forecasts by reporting 5.2 million new streaming customers in the second quarter.\n\nAs the second-quarter earnings season gears up, investors will put most of their focus on the performance of individual companies, analysts said.\n\n\u201cEarnings and guidance will move the market more than news out of D.C. Goldman is more important to the market today, as is Netflix, and that will be the case for the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.\n\nThe Dow was dragged lower by a drop in Goldman Sachs, which fell 2.6 percent to $223.31 after reporting a 40 percent fall in bond trading revenue and posted the weakest commodities results in its history as a public company.\n\nOther widely held stocks were active after posting results.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) gained 1.7 percent to $134.46 after saying expected sales growth to pick up in the second half of the year.\n\nHarley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) fell 5.9 percent to $48.95 after the motorcycle maker cut its forecast for 2017 shipments.\n\nAnalysts estimate an 8.5 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.7 percent increase in revenue for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier.\n\nThis follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted the fastest rate of growth in earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 54.99 points, or 0.25 percent, to 21,574.73, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.47 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,460.61 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 29.87 points, or 0.47 percent, to 6,344.31.\n\nBoth the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 set record closing highs.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index .VIX ticked up to end at 9.89 on its fourth consecutive close below 10.\n\nU.S. Senate Republicans failed to muster enough votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, but reaction was muted in the stock market. Analysts said the expectation for business-friendly legislation out of Washington is all but priced out of equities.\n\n\u201cInvestors are looking for an investment that doesn\u2019t need the economy to do a lot better, and (where) it doesn\u2019t need Washington,\u201d said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nTechnology .SPLRCT was the largest percentage gainer among the 11 S&P 500 sectors.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Twenty years after Reed Hastings co-founded Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and a decade after the company introduced video streaming, it hit another milestone - one that is key to its ability to sustain its scorching pace of growth.\n\nInternational subscriber count increased 8.6 percent to 52.03 million at the end of the June quarter, eclipsing domestic customer numbers of 51.92 million, Netflix said on Monday.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares jumped as much as 9.7 percent to a record high of $177.44 on Tuesday, on track to add roughly $7 billion to Netflix\u2019s $70 billion market value.\n\nBetting on original shows puts Netflix in pole position to win over more millennials who are shunning traditional television, analysts said.\n\nNetflix has a new-found ally as well: pay-TV platforms.\n\nSeveral companies such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Virgin Media in UK, and Altice in France are bundling Netflix into their pay-TV offerings, which could rapidly ramp up viewer numbers in younger markets, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\n\nAt least 17 brokerages raised their price targets on Netflix. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan were the most bullish, each raising their target to $210.\n\n\u201cWe believe the rapidly growing content offering led by originals, that in aggregate garnered 91 Emmy nominations last week, drove the stronger new sign-ups,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a research note.\n\nThis year, original TV shows including \u201cStranger Things\u201d, \u201cThe Crown\u201d and the latest season of Kevin Spacey-starrer \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d brought in more customers than Netflix had predicted for the second quarter.\n\nNetflix has a long way to go to get more content to please more members, Hastings said on a conference call on Monday, adding that positive returns made him comfortable that the company should continue to invest in original shows.\n\nThe company has often been criticized for spending too much on content. It said earlier it planned to spend about $6 billion this year for original shows and expected to have negative free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.\n\nWhile most analysts backed the company\u2019s strategy favoring scale over profit, a few disagreed.\n\n\u201cWe think that Netflix is destined to be a cash burning high growth company until it changes its strategy and accepts its fate as a highly profitable slow growth company,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, a long-time critic of the company.\n\nHe has an \u201cunderperform\u201d rating and a $82 price target.",
