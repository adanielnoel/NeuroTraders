DeKnight said they could push the boundaries of the Marvel Universe.\n\n\u201cThey let us have conversations, they let us have episodes where there\u2019s almost no action,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is a lot more violent than you\u2019ve seen in the Marvel cinematic universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaredevil\u201d is the first of five planned Netflix-Marvel series - \u201cA.K.A. Jessica Jones,\u201d \u201cLuke Cage,\u201d \u201cIron Fist\u201d and the ensemble \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d all of which will intersect in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nAnd both Cox and DeKnight said they would support Daredevil appearing in future Marvel films.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2018m invited to that party, I\u2018m there,\u201d Cox said with a laugh.",
