        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is pursuing a subscription video streaming service without commercials for the Chinese market, keeping with its traditional business model rather than seeking advertisers, Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S.-based company previously said it was developing plans to launch a \u201cmodest\u201d service in China if it can acquire permission to operate in the world\u2019s most populous country. Chinese consumers are used to watching entertainment for free that is either supported by ads or illegally pirated.\n\nNetflix offers on-demand TV shows and movies without commercials to customers who pay a monthly subscription price.\n\n\u201cOur focus and our expertise is really in commercial free,\u201d Hastings said in an interview. \u201cThat may confine us to being only part of the market the first couple years, but that\u2019s what we would do.\u201d\n\nNetflix now operates its video streaming service in roughly 50 countries and aims to reach 200 by the end of 2016. Its aggressive overseas growth strategy helped the company beat its own forecast by reaching 62.3 million streaming subscribers at the end of the March quarter.\n\nFor China, \u201cwe are continuing to explore options talking to both U.S. companies that have had success and difficulty in China and Chinese companies,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gradual process.\u201d\n\nTed Sarandos, the company\u2019s chief content officer, was quoted last month saying Netflix was likely to enter the Chinese market without a local partner. Such a move could make it harder to do business in a country known for censorship and strict regulation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sarandos told analysts the press reports of his remarks were \u201ca little bit out of context.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re anxious and open to all forms of doing business in China,\u201d Sarandos said on a webcast following the company\u2019s earnings report.",
