        "body": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc\u2019s U.S. business announced the first rises in monthly fees in two years on Thursday, hiking costs for two of its three main subscription plans as it spends heavily on its own original content.\n\nThe company's mid-range plan, which allows streaming on two devices at the same time, was increased to $10.99 per month from $9.99. nflx.it/2kpEiJk\n\nThe top-tier plan, which allows streaming on four screens in high definition, was raised to $13.99 per month from $11.99. The basic plan fee remained at $7.99.\n\nShares in the global streaming pioneer rose as much as 4.5 percent to a record high of $192.80.\n\n\u201cMost investors believe that Netflix is priced well below its value to consumers and want to see the management continue to increase monetization,\u201d Rob Sanderson analyst at MKM Partners said.\n\nIn 2011, Netflix raised prices for some customers by as much as $6, causing more than 800,000 U.S. subscribers to desert the service. reut.rs/2knr67y\n\nA more gradual move in 2014 did not provoke the same outrage.\n\nNetflix is cheaper than many of its competitors despite the current price hike. HBO Now, the standalone streaming service of HBO that offers access to shows such as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cVeep\u201d, is priced at $14.99 a month, while Hulu prices its service without commercials at $11.99 per month.\n\n\u201cThis price increase will likely be a revenue growth catalyst for the company,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a client note. \u201cThe content, not price, is the leading churn/churn-back factor amongst Netflix subs.\u201d\n\nThe price hikes will only be in the United States and will start taking effect from mid-November, depending on users\u2019 billing cycles.\n\nThe higher pricing comes as the video streaming service spends heavily on original content and expanding outside the U.S.\n\nNetflix had earlier said it would spend over $6 billion this year on original shows and expected to have negative free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.\n\n\u201cThe average revenue per user (ARPU) lift is a significant growth driver and important to ...
