The companies have been leery of potential competition from Netflix and other Silicon Valley newcomers.\n\nHastings said he believed U.S. cable operators would watch to see if the addition of Netflix helped Virgin, owned by John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global Plc, to sign up new customers.\n\n\u201cI think Virgin was willing to bet on their instinct that they should focus on a better experience,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cIf that works out, and they grow, then they will be very happy. And I think the other guys will follow.\u201d",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc gained more subscribers than expected at home and abroad with help from original series like \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d impressing investors who sent its shares surging nearly 11 percent to a record high on Monday.\n\nNetflix, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 in 2013, quadrupled profit in the third quarter as it added a higher-than-expected 1.3 million customers to its subscription video streaming service in the United States.\n\nThe company, which has invested heavily in original series such as political satire \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d said it had 31.1 million U.S. streaming users from July to September.\n\nFor the last three months of the year, Netflix said it expects to add about the same number of U.S. streaming customers it signed up a year earlier, and will end 2013 with 32.7 million to 33.5 million users.\n\n\u201cThat keeps the view alive that this company has a larger subscriber base and has pricing leverage in its corner to extract more value,\u201d said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible, who rates Netflix a \u201cbuy.\u201d\n\nShares rose 10.6 percent after-hours to $392.50, up from their close of $354.99 on the Nasdaq. The stock has racked up successive highs since September, as investors bet on its growth prospects.\n\nDuring the quarter, Netflix released critically acclaimed prison drama \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d part of its push into original programming to attract customers to its $8-a-month movie and TV streaming service.\n\nIts original series slate generated buzz during the quarter, with 14 Emmy nominations and three wins for shows including \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n\nThe company said it will double investments in original programming in 2014, when it will air second seasons of both \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d Spending on original shows will remain below 10 percent of its global content expenses.\n\nNetflix was added in September as an option on cable set-top boxes through two companies in Europe. CEO Reed Hastings, in a webcast after the earnings release, said he was \u201chopeful\u201d Netflix could reach a similar deal with Comcast Corp or other U.S. cable operators.\n\nWall Street also singled out the company\u2019s growth abroad. It added 1.4 million customers in international markets, bringing its reach in foreign territories to 9.2 million, and said it will launch in unspecified new countries next year.\n\nNetflix reported earnings-per-share of 52 cents, beating the average of 49 cents projected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nNet income for the quarter reached $32 million, up from $8 million a year earlier, Hastings and CFO David Wells said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s equity analyst Tuna Amobi said Netflix appeared to be gaining traction in some of its newest markets, and noted that \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d will end the year as the company\u2019s most-watched original series.\n\n\u201cThere is not a whole lot not to like. There is a whole lot of momentum behind the story,\u201d Amobi said. \u201cThey appear to have turned an important corner for potentially sustained subscriber growth.\u201d\n\nAmobi said he had a \u201chold\u201d rating on Netflix shares because of their valuation after the year\u2019s stock run-up. Before the earnings release, Netflix shares had gained 283 percent this year, far exceeding the 23 percent gain in the S&P 500.\n\nTwenty-three of 35 Wall Street analysts had a \u201chold\u201d rating prior to Monday\u2019s earnings release. Six rated Netflix a \u201cbuy\u201d and six recommended \u201csell.\u201d Skeptics question whether Netflix can grow quickly enough to justify its high share price and pay the cost of movies and TV shows, original programming, and its push into foreign territories.\n\nTen years ago, Netflix was the highest-performing stock on the Nasdaq when it was delivering video only through DVDs mailed in red envelopes, a business from which it is now moving away.\n\nAt that time, \u201cwe had solid results compounded by momentum-investor-fueled euphoria,\u201d Hastings and Wells said in their letter. \u201cSome of the euphoria today feels like 2003.\u201d",
