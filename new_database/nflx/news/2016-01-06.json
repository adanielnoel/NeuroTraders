Netflix\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) in the third quarter was $25.29 in the United States and $21.59 abroad.\n\nIn India, where a movie can cost 29 rupees (44 cents) and monthly subscriptions are as little as 200 rupees, analysts expect ARPUs to be a fraction of that.\n\nWith most Indians getting online with smartphones, a telecom partner could speed Netflix\u2019s market entry a year after Hotstar - from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc controlled Star Network - and three years after Singapore-based Spuul.\n\nNetflix paired with SoftBank Group Corp for its Japan launch, piggybacking on the one of the country\u2019s mobile network providers for its first foray in Asia in September.\n\nNetflix\u2019s U.S.-listed Indian rival Eros International PLC announced a partnership on Monday with Idea Cellular Ltd, the country\u2019s third-biggest mobile carrier with 167 million subscribers.\n\nFor telecoms companies, streaming services increase data consumption which is more lucrative than telephone calls. Moreover, movie subscriber numbers are widely expected to jump with the large scale introduction of 4G services, led by the Jio network of Reliance Industries Ltd.\n\nBut in price-sensitive India, reaching new customers with big-budget content is likely to prove far easier than fending off the appeal of cheap, easily available pirated copies.\n\n\u201cIn India our biggest worry is not Netflix,\u201d said Michael Smith, chief technology officer at startup Hooq, backed by Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, Time Warner Inc and Sony Corp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the 20 cent copy of a movie that has just been released.\u201d",
