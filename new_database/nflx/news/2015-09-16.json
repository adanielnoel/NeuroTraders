On the streaming service Netflix, however, \u201cyou can get into more dangerous topics.\u201d\n\nIn two years, Netflix Inc and online streaming platform Amazon Studios have drawn top names across film and television, enticing them with creative liberty, freedom from time constraints and no fears of offending advertisers.\n\nAs a result, online platforms are fast defining a new age of television that is reflected in 46 nominations for Amazon and Netflix shows at Sunday\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nFey\u2019s controversial topic came in the form of \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d about a chirpy, naive \u2018mole woman\u2019 who moves to New York after escaping her cult-like captor.\n\n\u201cWith a premise like this that is potentially tricky for people - a kidnapped woman who\u2019s getting her life back - once you move to Netflix, the premise is not a problem at all,\u201d Fey said.\n\nThe show goes into Sunday\u2019s ceremony with seven Emmy nominations including best comedy series. Netflix\u2019s political thriller \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and prison drama \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d are also well represented, along with Amazon\u2019s groundbreaking transgender series \u201cTransparent.\u201d\n\nAmazon offers TV shows and movies through its $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership. It releases a selection of pilots online and uses audience input to help decide which to greenlight.\n\nOn-demand viewing offered on streaming platforms lets viewers watch at their own pace and all episodes are released at once. The model disposes with scheduling decisions, breaks for commercials or potential problems with advertisers over content.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no topic we can\u2019t go toward. You don\u2019t have to worry about advertisers or institutions,\u201d Fey said.\n\nFor the creators of upcoming series \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d based on Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel of an alternate America in which the Nazis won World War Two, Amazon was the last port of call after a nearly decade-long journey to bring the series to television.\n\n\u201cThis show would not exist now were it not for Amazon,\u201d said Isa Dick Hackett, the late author\u2019s daughter and executive producer of the series, who pitched the show previously to the BBC and Syfy networks. It will be released on Amazon in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly ambitious, the material is sensitive. People said \u2018we don\u2019t want to do a show with Nazis,'\u201d Hackett said.\n\nBrazilian filmmaker Jose Padilha said Netflix was his only choice for his gritty Spanish/English-language drug drama \u201cNarcos,\u201d mainly for its reach across more than 50 countries, including Spanish-speaking nations.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make it bilingual because the real life story was bilingual, and we thought Netflix had the audience that would go for that,\u201d he said of \u201cNarcos,\u201d which was released on Netflix in August.\n\nSome of Hollywood\u2019s biggest players who have largely avoided television are now embracing the streaming trend.\n\nWoody Allen, who has not worked in television in more than 50 years, is creating a series for Amazon for release next year while Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are developing separate movies for Netflix.",
