The companies did not disclose terms of the deal.\n\nNetflix Inc said earlier on Sunday it had decided not to renew its agreement with Epix when it expires at the end of September as it focuses more on original programming and exclusive rights to movies, and less on non-exclusive content.\n\n\u201cWhile many of these (Epix) movies are popular, they are also widely available on cable and other subscription platforms at the same time as they are on Netflix,\u201d Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, wrote in a blog post.\n\n\u201cThrough our original films and some innovative licensing arrangements with the movie studios, we are aiming to build a better movie experience for you.\u201d Hulu and Epix said their deal would bring new releases from Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, MGM Studios Inc and Viacom Inc\u2019s Paramount Pictures to Hulu.\n\nEpix is a joint venture of the three studios, while Hulu is owned by Comcast Corp\u2019s NBCUniversal, 21st Century Fox Inc\u2019s Fox Broadcasting and Walt Disney Co\u2019s ABC.",
