        "body": "NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has cashed in big on Netflix Inc, taking advantage of a 457 percent gain in its shares since he bought more than 9 percent of the streaming video company only 14 months ago.\n\nIcahn, whose firm acquired Netflix shares for an average price of $58, is booking profits of between $700 million and $800 million on the 3 million shares he sold in the 12 days beginning on Oct. 10 and ending on Tuesday, according to an SEC filing issued after the market closed on Tuesday.\n\nThe biggest sales took place on Tuesday with Icahn selling 2.4 million shares at $341.44 for about $819 million. The Tuesday sale alone generated a profit of about $645 million. Icahn still holds 4.5 percent of Netflix, down from 9.4 percent in June -- the last time he publicly disclosed his holdings.\n\nIcahn, whose Icahn Enterprises has assets of approximately $29 billion, said in the filing that \u201cas a hardened veteran of seven bear markets I have learned that when you are lucky and/or smart enough to have made a total return of 457 percent in only 14 months it is time to take some of the chips off the table.\u201d\n\nHe added in the filing and a subsequent tweet: \u201cI want to thank Reed Hastings, Ted Sarandos and the rest of the Netflix team for a job well done. And last but not least, I wish to thank Kevin Spacey.\u201d\n\nIn multiple media appearances, Icahn has said his son Brett Icahn, a portfolio manager at the firm, was responsible for the Netflix investment and for maintaining the firm\u2019s 9.4% stake through a significant 2013 rally in the company\u2019s stock.\n\nIcahn\u2019s massive success with Netflix contrasts with an earlier attempt to make money out of the video business when he took a stake in Blockbuster back in 2004. Icahn called his play for the now bankrupt movie renter his \u201cworst investment\u201d in his 30-plus year career.\n\nNetflix shares plunged more than 9 percent to $322.53 on Tuesday ahead of Icahn\u2019s announcement on speculation that he was reducing his stake.\n\nAfter rising nearly 10 percent at the open following its announcement of stronger-than-expected results late on Monday, Netflix, the year\u2019s best performer in the S&P 500 index, suddenly faced a wave of selling. Volume spiked to 27 million shares, several times its normal levels, a sign of hot money leaving the stock.\n\nComing into the day, Netflix shares were up 282 percent on the year.\n\nThe stock\u2019s gains this year have led many analysts to say shares were vastly over valued, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 113 that dwarfs the 16.44 ratio of its industry peers. Last week the stock jumped 11 percent ahead of the earnings.\n\nWhile more than a dozen brokerages raised their price targets on the stock following the strong results, many of the targets remain below Netflix\u2019s current share price, a sign that even accelerated growth may not be enough to justify the company\u2019s nearly $21 billion market cap.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders released in conjunction with the results late Monday, Chief Executive Hastings and Chief Financial Officer David Wells downplayed some of the recent share gains, calling them reminiscent of similar surges in 2003, which preceded a sharp pullback. At that time, \u201cwe had solid results compounded by momentum-investor-fueled euphoria,\u201d they wrote.\n\nShort interest in the stock fell about 15 percent from mid-September to 6,956,792 shares as of Sept. 30, according to the latest data from Nasdaq. It was the lowest level since the end of July, suggesting that despite the stock\u2019s stunning gains, fewer investors are betting on the downside.\n\nTuesday\u2019s selling in Netflix spread to other big winners this year, including Tesla Motors Inc, Salesforce.com, and Priceline.com. All were lower on the day.\n\n\u201cOnce (Netflix) started weakening, you started seeing other momentum names with high betas that have been big winners this year and recently all started coming under significant pressure,\u201d Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, said referring to stocks that are generally more volatile than the rest of the market.

Chief Executive Reed Hastings warns that momentum investors have become too euphoric. Diluting the punchbowl by issuing more equity is a better way to calm this rowdy party \u2013 and answer doubts about the online video company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nNetflix and Hastings have seen similar surges in the company\u2019s value before. The stock quintupled in 2003. But Hastings knows the market can be manic-depressive \u2013 he points out the headlines today about its stock performance are \u201cexactly the same as in 2003.\u201d The stock lost two thirds its value in 2004, and saw another surge and plunge in 2011.\n\nSuch upward spikes carry problems. Equity grants may de-motivate employees if they soon fall massively underwater. Managers face intense shareholder pressure to deliver unrealistic earnings improvement commensurate with the stock\u2019s multiple. That increases the temptation to fudge financials or invest too much in speculative projects to deliver extraordinary growth.\n\nHastings\u2019 simple warning won\u2019t be sufficient. The stock rose 11 percent in after-hours trading as investors reveled in the firm\u2019s quarterly earnings, which were four times as high as a year ago. Instead of using the power of the pulpit, Hastings should consider issuing equity.\n\nNetflix\u2019s balance sheet contains just over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. It also had $6.4 billion of off balance sheet agreements to pay content producers as of June 30, with $2.5 billion due within a year. Selling stock would give the company cash it could use to pay off obligations, sign more movie deals, keep for a rainy day \u2013 or buy back stock should sentiment turn against Netflix again.\n\nThis is the kind of troublesome stock euphoria that, if managed wisely, could make for a happy ending.",
