Brown was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the \u201cAutopilot\u201d mode.\n\nTesla Inc did not immediately comment on Monday but said in 2016 that Autopilot \u201cdoes not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility.\u201d A lawyer for Brown\u2019s family, Jack Landskroner, declined to comment on Monday on the forthcoming hearing.\n\nDuring a 37-minute period of the trip when Brown was supposed to have his hands on the wheel, he apparently did so for just 25 seconds, the NTSB said in June.\n\nTesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements in Autopilot, putting new limits on hands-off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death.\n\nA board spokesman, Eric Weiss, said the NTSB could use the September board meeting to make policy recommendations. The board cannot order recalls or force regulatory changes.\n\nIn January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had found no evidence of defects in the aftermath of Brown\u2019s death.\n\nThe NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles per hour (119 kph), less than two minutes before the crash - above the 65-mph speed limit.",
