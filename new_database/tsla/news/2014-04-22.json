But local media reported last week that 23 customers outside the two cities were complaining they had not received delivery notices, despite being among the first batch of buyers.\n\nMusk said he had personally apologized to some disgruntled buyers and explained to them that the delay was due to a lack of service outlets or charging stations in their areas.\n\n\u201cIf there is no service center within a long distance from someone\u2019s house and we haven\u2019t resolved any charging question marks then there\u2019s a high risk that they will not have a good experience,\u201d he said.\n\nTesla, which opened a flagship store in Beijing late last year, plans to open stores in 10 to 12 Chinese cities by the end of 2014 as it expects China, the world\u2019s biggest auto market, to contribute one third of its global sales growth this year, China head Veronica Wu said in January.\n\nTougher competition is expected ahead. BMW aims to import its i3 this year, Volkswagen plans to sell more than 15 green vehicle models in China by 2018, and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) has formed a venture with Chinese carmaker BYD Co Ltd (002594.SZ) (1211.HK) to make electric vehicles.
