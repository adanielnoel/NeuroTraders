But it predicted Infineon would become a second source of such chips as volumes ramp next year.\n\nLast Friday, Tesla (TSLA.O) delivered the first 30 Model 3s to employee buyers, part of more than half a million advance reservations. (reut.rs/2tVmxlp)\n\nWhile its presence in the Model 3 could be a boost, Ploss said most of the demand for Infineon\u2019s electric vehicle parts would continue to come from Asia. \u201cOur success is very much dependent on Asia,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company reaffirmed its projection for 8-11 percent revenue growth for the year ending in September, and said its annual operating profit margin, excluding certain items, would be unchanged around 17 percent.\n\nInfineon shares, which had slipped in early trading, picked up after Ploss signaled it had a renewed appetite for mergers. The stock was up 1.7 percent at 18.70 euros at 1315 GMT.\n\nPloss said the company \u201ccontinues to explore various acquisition options\u201d after its agreed $850 million deal to buy the Wolfspeed power unit of Cree (CREE.O) collapsed under U.S. government scrutiny earlier this year.\n\nPloss told reporters on a conference call that Infineon remained interested in deals in the American market, but would be sure to steer clear of technology the U.S. government considers vital to national security.\n\nRevenue for its fiscal third quarter ended in June was roughly in line with expectations, up 12.2 percent on the same period a year ago to 1.83 billion euros.\n\nQuarterly operating income, excluding certain items, rose 33 percent to 338 million euros ($400 million), compared with analysts\u2019 average forecast of 323 million in a Reuters poll.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (TSLA.O) dropped 3.5 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk warned that the electric carmaker would face \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d as it ramps up production of its new mass-market Model 3 sedan.\n\nAt a launch event on Friday, Musk said customers had made over half a million advance reservations for the Model 3 as he handed over the first 30 cars to employee buyers, setting the stage for a major test of Tesla\u2019s strategy to become a profitable electric car maker.\n\nTesla is counting on the Model 3 to help turn the cash-losing company into a profitable one and transform it from a niche player to a heavyweight in the automobile industry.\n\nInvestors already skeptical of Tesla\u2019s aggressive growth targets focused on a warning by Musk that early production would be challenging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell,\u201d Musk told journalists ahead of the event. He later made similar comments on stage.\n\nInvestors may get an idea of how \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d will affect Tesla\u2019s rate of cash burn when the company posts its quarterly results on Wednesday. The Palo Alto, California company has spent over $2 billion in cash so far this year ahead of the launch.\n\nAlso on Monday, a group of workers at the Fremont, California factory where the Model 3 is made sent an open letter to the independent members Tesla\u2019s board. The employees, who are trying to start a union, requested access to company safety plans and information on compensation.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has gained 53 percent in 2017, although it is down from a record high in June.\n\nThe $35,000 Model 3 is designed for easy production, with output targeted to reach 20,000 per month by December. Tesla\u2019s last launch was the luxury Model X SUV in 2015 which had several production problems and a price tag starting around $80,000.\n\nTesla has promised to boost total car production to 500,000 vehicles next year, close to six times its 2016 output, a target that many auto industry experts believe is unrealistic. It sold 76,230 cars last year.\n\nAt the event, Musk said the price of a Model 3 with all of available options could reach $59,000. That level could scare off potential Tesla customers, wrote Barclays analyst Brian Johnson in a note to clients.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock was down $11.85 at $323.21 at mid-afternoon.",

        "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor David Einhorn, who has been hurt by his bet against Tesla Inc, said on Tuesday that the electric car maker is over-valued and that the company is not adequately capitalized.\n\n\u201cThe company is expected to burn over $2 billion this year as it begins production of its Model 3,\u201d Einhorn said on an earnings call for his reinsurance company Greenlight Capital Re. \u201cIt is currently only capitalized for the next three quarters,\u201d he added.\n\nPerformance at Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital has been hurt by bets against high-flying stocks like Tesla, Amazon.com Inc and Athenahealth Inc which he calls his bubble basket stocks. But he is sticking with those short bets.\n\nTesla\u2019s share price has surged 50 percent to $319.82 since January and Einhorn said the rise weighed on his fund\u2019s performance between April and June.\n\nThis week Tesla\u2019s share price has dropped after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk warned that the company would face \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d as it ramps up production of its new mass-market Model 3 sedan.\n\nIn July Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital performed better when a 2.1 percent gain helped wipe away almost all losses for the year. On the call Einhorn discussed only second-quarter performance. During those three months the fund lost 4 percent, leaving the firm with a 2.8 percent loss in the first half.\n\nGreenlight Capital, like most hedge funds, is trailing the broader stock market Standard & Poor\u2019s index 11.6 percent gain in the first seven months of 2017.\n\nEinhorn also said the fund lost money on its bets against Amazon and Athenahealth. But he is not making changes, saying \u201cI like the composition of the portfolio.\u201d\n\nHis winners during the quarter included a bet on Bayer AG where he said a planned $66 billion takeover of U.S. agrochemicals group Monsanto Co would be enhancing. Also a bet against oil exploration company Continental Resources Inc was a winner Einhorn said.",
