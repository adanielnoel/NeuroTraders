The investigation focuses on two Model S fires that happened after the vehicles ran over debris on U.S. highways. The third Model S fire, which is not part of the NHTSA probe, occurred when a vehicle hit a concrete wall in Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe subject vehicles caught fire after an undercarriage strike with metallic roadway debris,\u201d NHTSA said on its website. \u201cThe resulting impact damage to the propulsion battery tray (baseplate) initiated thermal runaway.\u201d\n\nThe KBA letter, as translated by Tesla, said \u201cno further measures\u201d were deemed necessary under Germany\u2019s Product Safety Act.",
