Global companies like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Koninklijke Philips NV (PHG.AS) and Unilever NV (UNc.AS), have all been embroiled in trademark disputes in the country in the past.\n\nBased in China\u2019s southern province of Guangdong, Zhan registered the trademarks to the Tesla name in both English and Chinese in 2006. He had in the past sought to sell the label to the U.S. company but negotiations collapsed.\n\n\u201cTesla has successfully concluded an agreement with Mr. Zhan Baosheng to completely and amicably resolve the dispute between the parties,\u201d Tesla said in Wednesday\u2019s statement. \u201cThese actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u201d",
