        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Volvo has just given Tesla a shock. The Sweden-based carmaker on Wednesday said it will stop producing new gasoline-only engines from 2019 and shift to a variety of hybrid and all-electric models. That may not appear too significant at first \u2013 the company, after all, accounted for just 0.6 percent of global vehicle sales last year. But its plan sums up the challenges faced by Elon Musk\u2019s firm.\n\nGranted, Volvo is over-revving its engine by proclaiming it\u2019s going \u201call electric.\u201d It has no plans yet to drop existing gasoline vehicles. And it will keep the combustion engine in two of the three options it will introduce starting in two years\u2019 time \u2013 a plug-in hybrid, which can use either gasoline or electric power, and what it calls the mild hybrid, like Toyota\u2019s Prius, which converts braking power into electricity.\n\nREUTERS RECOMMENDS\n\nTesla's Model S fails to ace some tests in highway safety evaluation\n\nU.S. cars a tough sell in South Korea even as Trump targets trade deal\n\nFord's China sales bounce back in June as tax impact fades\n\nThe industry sells more cars with these engines than pure electric-powered ones. That\u2019s especially true in the fast-growing Chinese market, where around half the world\u2019s electric and hybrid cars are sold and where Volvo\u2019s owner, Geely, is based.\n\nTesla accounts for just 3 percent of electric vehicle and hybrid sales there, Barclays points out. Local players selling cheaper cars dominate; meanwhile, the likes of Daimler and General Motors are bulking up. That\u2019s likely to bring down the cost of batteries even further, robbing Tesla of one of its major advantages.\n\nIt\u2019s emblematic of the growing competition Tesla is facing around the world. Virtually all carmakers have electric and hybrid offerings of their own, whether smaller vehicles like the Nissan Leaf or BMW\u2019s high-end i3 and i8.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Musk\u2019s company is driving down a dead-end street. But it once again calls into question his aggressive target of selling 500,000 vehicles by the end of next year \u2013 five times this year\u2019s run rate and just shy of what Volvo currently delivers - and 1 million by 2020.\n\nMoreover, Tesla is still suffering from growing pains. The latest slip-up was a lack of batteries, which kept production 40 percent below demand for much of the second quarter, the company said just before the July 4 holiday.\n\nThat and Volvo\u2019s news took more than 7 percent off Tesla\u2019s stock on Wednesday. Even so, Musk\u2019s carmaker trades at 25 times estimated 2020 earnings, compared with Toyota\u2019s multiple of just over 10 times 2017 earnings. More pain lies ahead.",
