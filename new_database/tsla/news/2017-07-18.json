        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The driver of a Tesla vehicle involved in a crash in Minnesota on Saturday has denied that its Autopilot system caused the incident, according to an email released by the automaker on Monday.\n\nThe Kandiyohi County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement on Sunday that the driver of the 2016 Tesla had said that when he engaged the Autopilot system it caused the vehicle to suddenly accelerate and then roll over, resulting in minor injuries to himself and four passengers.\n\nBut the driver said in the email released by Tesla Inc on Monday he believed he had disengaged the Autopilot system at the time of the crash. Tesla shares fell in trading on Monday after the crash was reported.\n\nThe driver, David Clark, 58, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cI did not intend to put the blame Tesla or the auto pilot system as I am aware that I need to be in control of the vehicle regardless if the auto pilot system is engaged or not,\u201d Clark said in an email to the sheriff\u2019s department released by Tesla.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla shares, which fell as low as $313.45 on Monday, rebounded later and were down 2.8 percent at $318.69 in afternoon trading.\n\nAutopilot has faced intense scrutiny in the past from U.S. regulators.\n\nTesla said in a statement it had \u201cno reason to believe that Autopilot ... worked other than as designed.\u201d\n\n\u201dEvery time a driver engages Autopilot, they are reminded of their responsibility to remain engaged and to be prepared to take immediate action at all times, and drivers must acknowledge their responsibility to do so before Autopilot is enabled,\u201d the auotmaker added.\n\nJoshua Brown, a former Navy SEAL, was killed near Williston, Florida, in May 2016 when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in Autopilot mode.\n\nThe incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human driver.\n\nIn January, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had found no evidence of defects with Autopilot following Brown\u2019s death.",
