        "body": "(Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) reported a wider first-quarter net loss on Wednesday, but outperformed expectations and stuck to key milestones for the year ahead, despite pressure on margins.\n\nChief Executive Officer Elon Musk said during a conference call that demand for the company\u2019s new line of stationary energy storage systems, unveiled last week, is \u201coff the hook.\u201d\n\nOver time, it was possible stationary storage could be a bigger business for Tesla than selling cars, he added.\n\nTesla said in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday that \u201ctotal addressable market size for Tesla Energy products is enormous and much easier to scale globally than vehicle sales.\u201d\n\nMusk said last week that the stationary battery storage systems could be \u201cmaterially profitable\u201d sometime next year.\n\nThe shares of the Silicon Valley electric car maker rose about 2 percent after hours from their close of $230.43.\n\nThe challenges confronting Tesla\u2019s auto business were illustrated by the company\u2019s continued cash burn and signs of pressure on profit margins.\n\nTesla\u2019s cash reserves fell to $1.5 billion as of March 31 from $1.9 billion at the end of 2014. The company said it plans a total of $1.5 billion in capital spending this year, much of it to buy production tools for the Model X, complete its large battery \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Nevada, and for other facilities.\n\nMusk said Tesla\u2019s cash flow should turn positive later in the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely likely cash flow is really good\u201d by the end of the fourth quarter, he said.\n\nChief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said Tesla is looking at establishing asset backed lines of credit to \u201cassure we have a strong balance sheet.\u201d\n\nTesla reported an adjusted net loss of 36 cents a share in the latest quarter, excluding certain expenses, compared with a profit of 14 cents a share on the same basis a year ago. Analysts had expected a loss of 50 cents a share on that adjusted basis.\n\nTesla had a net loss in the first quarter of $154.2 million, or $1.22 a share, on revenues of $939.9 million. A year ago, Tesla reported a net loss of $49.8 million, on revenues of $620.5 million.\n\nHowever, the automaker warned that a \u201cless rich product mix\u201d could push down average selling prices for the Model S sedan, which now starts at $76,200.\n\nTesla delivered 10,045 Model S sedans in the first quarter, a 55 percent increase from the year before. The company forecast deliveries of 10,000 to 11,000 vehicles in the second quarter.\n\nTesla could face more competition in the future as established automakers field new electric vehicles with longer driving ranges. There is also the potential other well capitalized Silicon Valley companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) or Google Inc (GOOGL.O) will move into the market.\n\nAsked about that, Musk said: \u201cI certainly hope Apple gets into the car business. That would be great.\u201d\n\nTesla said it will start delivering its Model X sport utility vehicle late in the third quarter, still within the window the company promised earlier this year. The Model X is critical to Tesla\u2019s goal of delivering 55,000 vehicles this year.",

        "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - An Oregon science teacher accused of using lab equipment to burn messages into the arms of at least eight teenage students was arrested and booked on two counts of criminal mistreatment, police said on Wednesday.\n\nSamuel Dufner, 37, is alleged by students to have used a Tesla coil, a device that produces sparks and is often used to illustrate electrical principles, to burn \u201cI heart Mom\u201d into the arms of 15-year-olds in one of his classes, said Salem Police Lieutenant Steve Burr.\n\nA parent reported the incident to South Salem High School, located in the state capital, Salem, about 50 miles south of Portland, and school officials alerted police late on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis was a new one for me,\u201d Burr said. \u201cI had to look up Tesla coil on Wikipedia this morning.\u201d\n\nThe device was being used in several classes last week to ignite gases that would propel a rocket for a science demonstration, and police said it was not clear if students in other classes may also have been burned by Dufner.\n\nMost of the students\u2019 burns seemed to be fading and were unlikely to cause permanent marks, Burr said, but he added the injuries seemed significant enough to leave a possible scar on one student\u2019s arm.\n\nDufner was arrested on Tuesday and released later that day after posting $2,000 bail. The school district is cooperating in the investigation and had placed Dufner on administrative leave, police said.\n\nBurr said it was not clear if the teacher would ultimately be charged in court.",
