        "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) said on Monday that parts shortages hampered vehicle production and sales in the first quarter, but the electric car maker still plans to build 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles this year.\n\nTesla shares closed up nearly 4 percent, at $246.99, after it reported over the weekend that it had taken 276,000 orders through Saturday for its new Model 3 sedan. After the close, the shares surrendered some of those gains, drifting to $241.20, down 2.3 percent.\n\nIn the first quarter, Tesla delivered 14,820 vehicles, including 12,420 Model S sedans and 2,400 Model X utility vehicles. Earlier, the company told analysts it expected to sell 16,000 vehicles in the quarter.\n\nTesla said \u201csevere shortages\u201d of parts for the Model X in January and February cut into planned production. By late March, Model X production had ramped back up to 750 a week.\n\nUnusually, Tesla blamed the parts shortages on its own \u201chubris\u201d - specifically, in adding \u201cfar too much new technology\u201d to the Model X, including a unique set of \u201cfalcon wing\u201d rear doors that turned out to be far more difficult to engineer than the company anticipated.\n\nTesla also cited \u201cinsufficient validation\u201d of its supplier capability, as well as its own inability to manufacture some of the parts in-house.\n\nIt said it is addressing all three issues \u201cto ensure that these mistakes are not repeated with the Model 3 launch,\u201d which is scheduled in about 18 months.\n\nTesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the company aims to boost annual production to 500,000 units by 2020 after the introduction of the mass-market Model 3.\n\nInvestors have expressed concerns about the company\u2019s ability to meet ambitious production targets for the Model 3, especially after the slower-than-expected launch and production ramp-up of the Model X.",
