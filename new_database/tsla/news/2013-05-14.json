This is about 11 percent of Tesla\u2019s expected 2013 revenue of $1.7 billion.\n\nThe automaker, which makes the Model S electric sedan, leaned heavily on these credit sales during the first quarter when the company reported its first-ever quarterly profit. Tesla shares have climbed about 50 percent since the report.\n\nCredit sales \u201care a big deal to Tesla,\u201d Jonas wrote in a research note. \u201cAt one level, it amounts to a continuous capital raise, funded by the established internal combustion engine auto competition. This is one part irony, one part grand design.\u201d\n\nUnder tough measures passed last year, automakers selling 20,000 or more cars in California must ensure that low- and zero-emission cars account for 22 percent of sales by 2025. Eleven other states have adopted those standards.\n\nThese policies have opened up a market that benefits companies like Tesla, which has accumulated green car credits because it only sells electric cars. Tesla has been able to generate revenue from selling its credits to other companies.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Tesla drew $68 million, or about 12 percent of its first-quarter revenue, from selling zero-emission credits. Jonas said Tesla made about $17.1 million from selling greenhouse gas credits.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Tesla reported a gross margin of 17 percent. Excluding the effect of the credit sales, Tesla\u2019s margin was 2 percent from its core auto business, Jonas said.\n\n\u201cStripping out the credits reveals a still very low profitability for the core auto business in 1Q,\u201d Jonas wrote in a research note. The figures suggest that \u201cthe vast majority of the company\u2019s 1Q gross margin came from the credits themselves.\u201d\n\nTesla expects revenue from credit sales to fall over the course of the year. Tesla is aiming for a 25 percent gross margin by the fourth quarter, excluding the credit sales, from higher sales of the Model S and more efficient operations.\n\nRevenue from credit sales could \u201cconceivably be large enough\u201d to allow Tesla to pay off the balance of its $465 million U.S. Department of Energy loan in the next 12 to 18 months, Jonas said.\n\nHe added that it could also pay for the company\u2019s capital expenditures in 2013 and make up a \u201csignificant\u201d portion of capex and research and development costs in the future.",

        "body": "NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - The wave of short-covering that drove shares of electric car maker Tesla Motors to huge gains last week appears to have subsided, but there are still plenty of investors willing to bet against the stock.\n\nTesla shares hit a peak of $97.12 on Tuesday, before falling back, and are up nearly 50 percent since last Wednesday, just before the company blew past Wall Street estimates to post its first-ever quarterly profit.\n\nThe massive rally has come on increased volume and as several analysts rushed to raise their price targets. At Tuesday\u2019s closing price of $83.24 a share, Tesla is now more overvalued than 98 percent of other U.S. stocks, based on a Thomson Reuters Starmine screen of stock valuations. It was just a month ago that Tesla shares traded in the low $40s.\n\nIn the last week, the price target of analysts on average has risen to $70 from $50 a share.\n\nThe stock won a stamp of approval on Tuesday from Morgan Stanley, which kept its \u201coverweight\u201d rating on Tesla and boosted its target price on the stock to $103 from $47. Morgan Stanley owns more than 1 percent of the stock and has done investment-banking work for the company.\n\nOn the other hand, those confident the stock is way overvalued are short about 17 percent of Tesla shares - even at an annualized borrowing cost of about 30 percent, or 100 times the borrowing cost of an average stock, according to Markit.\n\n\u201cSome of the short sellers have covered, there are plenty more to cover and they\u2019ve got a choice now: Do they stay in, thinking it can\u2019t sustain the spike, or do they just get out and take a huge loss right now?\u201d said William Duff Gordon, research director at Markit in London.\n\nThose who are looking to short have some evidence on their side - with a price-to-earnings ratio above 227, Tesla is nearly 30 times overvalued compared with other automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Porsche, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nExcitement over the company\u2019s first-ever profit helped fuel a sharp rally in the stock that caught short-sellers betting on declines. Trading volume spiked to more than 28 million shares on Thursday, a record, and on Tuesday to more than 37 million, again a record.\n\nSome of the recent gains have come from short sellers covering their bearish bets. Shares outstanding held for short bets fell from more than 20 percent before Tesla reported earnings to 17 percent on Monday, according to Markit data.\n\n\u201cIt appears the shorts are still around in the sense of short-term players,\u201d said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York. \u201cThe institutional players, though, less of those are resetting (their short bet) at the higher levels.\u201d\n\nAfter three days of the stock\u2019s opening near its lows and closing near the day\u2019s highs, shares ended down 5.2 percent on Tuesday, which suggests the short-covering rally had ended.\n\nRecent activity in Tesla suggests it has become a momentum crowd stock, similar to Netflix or, in years past, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. These types of companies generally come out of innovative industries, or sometimes fads, and boast increasing revenue. The stocks tend to rise sharply on increasing trading volume, and as a result, attract bets against them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a precarious situation because the price has spiked so much, but people might be patient and stay there,\u201d said Gordon of Markit.\n\nTwo of every three Tesla shares available for loan are still being borrowed, indicating there are many betting the recent rally will reverse and the stock will break down.\n\n\u201cMany industry players and market observers have been waiting for Tesla to fail since it went public in the summer of 2010,\u201d said the Morgan Stanley note.\n\n\u201cThey may need to be waiting for a very long time.\u201d",

        "body": "And the good news keeps coming for Tesla.\n\nJust a day after the company reported record sales and its first-ever quarterly profit, Consumer Reports announced that the electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s Model S has received the highest test rating of any car in its 2013 car ratings. And just to put a cherry on top, the notoriously tough Consumer Reports writers say that the $89,650 Tesla Model S comes close to, and just may be, the best car ever.\n\n\u201cThis car performs better than anything we\u2019ve ever tested before,\u201d Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports\u2019 director of testing says. \u201cNot just the best electric car, but the best car. It does just about everything really, really well.\u201d\n\nBecause the batteries are in the floor, the car\u2019s center of gravity is very low, Consumer Reports says, giving it superb handling. The Model S, which seats 7 with an optional jump seat, has \u201cimpressive power\u201d and uses half the energy of a Toyota Prius, for a 200-mile range.\n\nTesla\u2019s 17\u2033 touchscreen, which drivers use to control the vehicle\u2019s climate and other systems, is \u201clike a giant iPad,\u201d and almost as simple to use, the report states. And despite the fact that Tesla has only been building cars for a few years, the Model S performs better than vehicles made by manufacturers that have been building vehicles for over a hundred years, Consumer Reports says.\n\nTesla earned its first-ever profit of $15 million this past quarter on record sales of $562 million. In the earnings release, CEO Elon Musk said he anticipates demand of 30,000 cars a year in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. But with reviews like this, he may want to revise that number significantly upwards.\n\nOne note for those of us who don\u2019t have $90,000 in loose change under the sofa seats: Musk promised that Tesla\u2019s next model will be much more affordable.\n\n\u201cThe Model S is priced substantially lower than the Roadster, and our third generation vehicle will again be priced much lower than the Model S,\u201d he said yesterday in a statement.",

        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nTesla\u2019s shareholders seem to be assuming Chief Executive Elon Musk is infallible. The $10 billion U.S. electric carmaker is on a roll, last week recording its first quarterly profit and receiving the best score the Consumer Reports publication has bestowed on a car for six years. The company\u2019s stock has since surged as much as 70 percent, leaving Tesla worth more than Fiat and Peugeot combined and trading at a whopping 27 times estimates for earnings in 2016.\n\nBoth top and bottom lines look set for rapid expansion now that production of the award-winning Model S is in full swing. Tesla\u2019s revenue for the first three months of the year jumped 83 percent from the previous quarter as sales hit 400 vehicles a week. Consensus estimates for 2014 put sales at $2.5 billion, six times last year\u2019s showing. By 2016, that\u2019s expected to almost double again to $4.3 billion.\n\nAnd Tesla\u2019s gross margin is improving, reaching 17 percent in the three months to March. Musk predicts it will reach 25 percent in the fourth quarter. This measure does not, however, take research and development or general and administrative costs into account. Factor those in and Tesla\u2019s pre-tax margin in 2016 is estimated at 12 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s impressive for a car company \u2013 Ford\u2019s North America division, for example, tops out at 11 percent in a good quarter. But it\u2019s hardly in the same league as Silicon Valley fellows like Google, whose pre-tax margin was 28 percent last quarter.\n\nTo justify Tesla\u2019s high 2016 valuation multiple, revenue would need to keep growing at a fast clip. Musk has plans to launch a crossover SUV followed by cars that may sell for around $45,000 \u2013 not far off half the price of some versions of the Model S. He may even develop vehicles in the $30,000 price range to attract more buyers. But that will take time and shift the company into a more cut-throat market segment where margins could suffer.\n\nMusk has battled everything from skepticism about a manufacturing startup to tight cash flow and, most recently, attempts by traditional car dealers in Texas and Virginia to stop him selling vehicles directly to the public. His record so far is impressive. But Tesla\u2019s stock price suggests investors are pulling ahead of themselves.",
