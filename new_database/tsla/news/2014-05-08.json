Auto dealers trying to sneak in a monopoly creation bill today,\u201d Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted late on Thursday.\n\nThe bill with the new language, passed by the Senate on Wednesday, will go back to the House for a final vote,\u201d the blog said.\n\nMusk has long argued that car dealers are a bad fit for 11-year-old Tesla because they make more money from selling traditional cars than selling the company\u2019s Model S.\n\nDealers say the franchise system, in which automakers rely on a network of independent dealers to sell cars, offers an extra layer of accountability for consumers. They argue that competition between dealers also lowers car prices.",
