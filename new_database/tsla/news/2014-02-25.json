However, it said at the time that further details would be announced this week.\n\nTesla declined to comment on Tuesday. Panasonic, the carmaker\u2019s primary supplier of lithium-ion batteries, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe U.S. plant, which will handle everything from processing raw materials to assembly, will produce small, lightweight batteries for Tesla and may also supply Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and other automakers, the Nikkei said.\n\nBattery costs have been a major stumbling block to widespread electric car adoption in the United States, according to analysts. Tesla\u2019s giga factory will lower costs by shifting material, cell, module and pack production to one spot.\n\nIn Tesla\u2019s earnings conference call last week, Chief Executive Elon Musk said the electric car maker expects to build the factory with more than one partner, but a \u201cdefault assumption\u201d was that Panasonic, as a current battery cell partner, \u201cwould continue to partner with us in the giga factory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe factory is really there to support the volume of the third generation car,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cWe want to have the vehicle engineering and tooling come to fruition the same time as the giga factory. It is already part of one strategy, one combined effort.\u201d\n\nTesla posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and said deliveries of its luxury Model S electric sedan would surge more than 55 percent this year to more than 35,000 vehicles.\n\nShares in the Palo Alto, California-based company, which was founded in 2003, surged as much as 19 percent on Tuesday, hitting a new all-time high intraday trading price of $259.20 a share after Morgan Stanley raised its target price for the stock to $320 a share from $153.\n\nTesla shares were still up $30.50, or 14 percent, at $248.15 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in his research note that the potential for lower battery costs through higher sales volume could nearly double Tesla\u2019s share of the global car market to 0.9 percent by 2028. Tesla remains the firm\u2019s top pick in the U.S. auto sector with an \u201coverweight\u201d rating.\n\n\u201cTesla is an extremely ambitious company for whom flooding the market with fun-to-drive EVs and giving competitors a headache might not be the endgame,\u201d he said.\n\nStifel analyst James Albertine said the giga factory could be far more than an auto opportunity, as Tesla could have an even more significant opportunity to supply the energy storage market. He expects the factory would take two to three years to build and require a $5 billion to $6 billion capital infusion.\n\n\u201cWhile we remain negative on Tesla shares above $200 as an automotive OEM (original equipment manufacturer), the energy storage opportunity requires a broader perspective and could very well justify current, if not higher valuation levels,\u201d he said in a research note.",

In a separate ranking of brands, however, Detroit automakers had the four lowest scores of 23 brands rated.\n\nSouth Korean automaker Hyundai (005380.KS), and German brands BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi had models topping the 10 Consumer Reports vehicle categories.\n\n\u201cThe competition in the marketplace has grown fierce. There was a time when a handful of brands dominated our top picks list, but in recent years we\u2019ve seen a more diverse group make the cut,\u201d Rik Paul, Consumer Reports\u2019 automotive editor, said in a statement.\n\nThe top picks were chosen from more than 260 vehicles tested by Consumer Reports for reliability, safety and road-test performance.\n\nThe battery-powered Tesla Model S was chosen best overall for its \u201cexceptional performance and its many impressive technological innovations,\u201d Consumer Reports said, noting it was \u201cpricey\u201d at $89,650.\n\nCalifornia-based Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O), which was founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk in 2003, said it expects to deliver about 35,000 of the model this year. By comparison, the best-selling car in the United States last year, the Toyota Camry, sold about 408,000 in 2013.\n\nConsumer Reports hasn\u2019t named a best overall since a Lexus model took the top honors in 2010.\n\nHonda (7267.T) and Subaru (7270.T) were the only automakers with more than one model in this year\u2019s top picks. Honda\u2019s Accord won best midsize sedan, and its Odyssey was named top minivan. The best compact car went to Subaru\u2019s Impreza, and its Forester model was picked as the top small SUV.\n\nToyota\u2019s (7203.T) Prius hybrid, with its 44 miles-per-gallon overall fuel efficiency, was named best green car for the 11th consecutive year.\n\nThe Audi A6 took top honors in the luxury car rankings for the second year in a row, while the BMW 328i was chosen best sports sedan, also for a second straight year.\n\nJapanese automakers, which historically have taken more than 70 percent of the top picks, managed to win only five of the 10 categories, the worst showing since Consumer Reports began publishing the list in 1997.\n\nConsumer Reports also released its annual report card on car brands. It rates each manufacturer\u2019s individual brands, with a composite score based on reliability and road testing.\n\nLexus, Toyota\u2019s luxury brand, came out on top for the second straight year, with a score of 79. Honda\u2019s Acura was second with 75, followed by Audi with 74.\n\nConsumer Reports said of Lexus: \u201cIts models are usually quiet, comfortable, and fuel efficient, and they\u2019re among the most reliable cars made.\u201d\n\nSubaru and Toyota tied for the fourth spot. Mazda, Honda, Infiniti, Daimler AG\u2019s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and BMW rounded out the top 10.\n\nDetroit-based manufacturers fared poorly in this ranking, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u2019 FIA.MI Jeep tying Ford for worst of the 23 brands listed. Consumer Reports said both Jeep and Ford models had reliability problems.\n\nFiat Chrysler\u2019s Dodge and General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) Cadillac were also among the four lowest-scoring brands.\n\nGM\u2019s Buick and GMC tied for 12th, the highest rating for Detroit automakers.\n\nConsumer Reports said it didn\u2019t have brand report cards for Fiat, Tata Motors Ltd\u2019s (TAMO.NS) Jaguar and Land Rover brands, Ford\u2019s Lincoln, BMW\u2019s Mini, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram, Toyota\u2019s Scion, Daimler\u2019s Smart and Tesla because of a lack of data.",
