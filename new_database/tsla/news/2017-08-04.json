        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc reported quarterly revenue that doubled on Wednesday and a loss that was the electric car maker\u2019s largest ever, but its shares rose after revealing more than 1,800 daily reservations for the Model 3 and predicting increased Model S deliveries in the second half of 2017.\n\nShares rose as high as 8 percent to $351.67 in late trade.\n\nDespite a warning by Chief Executive Elon Musk last week that the Silicon Valley automaker would face six months of \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d in producing its first Model 3s, investors were enthusiastic over a remaining $3 billion cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, as loss-making Tesla spent just shy of $1 billion on capital expenditures, less than expected.\n\nStill, given the continued build-out of the Fremont factory and Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada, the possibility of continued cash burn is high. Tesla said it plans $2 billion in capital expenses in the second half of the year, which would erode its cash cushion to about $1 billion.\n\nMusk, however, told analysts on a conference call the company was considering debt to expand cash on hand, \u201cbut not thinking about a capital raise.\u201d\n\nChief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said Tesla\u2019s spending was at \u201chistorical highs,\u201d amounting to over $100 million per week.\n\nModel S demand was increasing, Tesla said, adding that Model S and X deliveries would rise in the second half of 2017.\n\nMusk said investors should have \u201czero concern\u201d that Tesla would fail to reach its production target of 10,000 vehicles each week by the end of 2018.\n\nBullish investors - who sent Tesla\u2019s share price up 77 percent from January to a June high of $386.99 - are betting on Musk\u2019s strategy to transform the low-volume automaker into a clean energy and transportation company offering electric semi-trailer trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage.\n\nTesla\u2019s results came within a week of Tesla\u2019s long anticipated Model 3 launch, where Musk revealed that first off the production line would be a $44,000 version of the car with a 310-mile (500 km) range. That is significantly higher than the $35,000 price most customers were anticipating, before incentives. That base model will begin production in January.\n\nElon corrected a statement he made at the event that Tesla had booked over 500,000 net reservations for the Model 3, changing that to 455,000.\n\nTesla will begin delivering Model 3s to non-employees in the fourth quarter, it said.\n\nAs production improves, the non-GAAP Model 3 gross margin should be positive in the fourth quarter, Tesla said, eventually growing to 25 percent in 2018.\n\nRevenue in the quarter rose to $2.79 billion from $1.27 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe company's net loss attributable to shareholders widened to $336.4 million, from $293.2 million a year earlier. (bit.ly/2uXmTL2)\n\nOn a per share basis, net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to $2.04 from $2.09.",

        "body": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) jumped over 6 percent on Thursday as its quarterly report fueled bets that its new Model 3 sedan would propel the luxury electric carmaker into the mainstream.\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk is counting on the Model 3, Tesla\u2019s least pricey car, to make the company profitable and establish it as the leading electric carmaker ahead of BMW, General Motors and other long-established players.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock is up 63 percent in 2017, underscoring Wall Street\u2019s confidence in Musk.\n\nThe Palo Alto, California company late on Wednesday reported quarterly results that beat average analyst estimates, and said it received more than 1,800 reservations per day for the Model 3 since its launch last week.\n\nTesla had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the June quarter, reassuring investors who were worried after Musk warned on Friday that the automaker would face six months of \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d in ramping up production of the Model 3.\n\nTesla\u2019s cash burn, expected to top $2 billion this year, has prompted short-sellers like Greenlight Capital\u2019s David Einhorn to bet against the company [L1N1KN1FE], and some analysts expect the carmaker to seek extra funding this year.\n\nMusk said investors should have \u201czero concern\u201d Tesla would fail to reach its production target of 10,000 vehicles each week by the end of 2018.\n\nSkeptics believe Tesla\u2019s aggressive production targets are unrealistic and the company\u2019s electric cars will be overtaken by larger automakers.\n\nYet at least two brokerages raised their price targets following Tesla\u2019s report. RBC Capital Markets upped its target price by $31 to $345, pushing it well ahead of the median target of $322, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have meaningful reason to doubt that Tesla can eventually achieve its targets, doing so in a timely manner without some growing pains could prove challenging,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a research note.\n\nPortfolio managers who hold shares of Tesla say they saw the most recent quarter as further evidence Musk will deliver on his promise of building a product that consumers want, even if he sometimes misses deadlines.\n\n\u201cInvestors trust Musk because he\u2019s made it work. It\u2019s not that every one of his predictions have come true on schedule, but they have all come true,\u201d said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds (ALTEX.O) who holds shares of the company.\n\nThe $35,000 base-price Model 3 is Tesla\u2019s least expensive car. It is designed and priced to compete with high-volume luxury sedans like the Audi A4, BMW 3-series or Mercedes C-Class. Those typically sell for between $40,000 and $50,000, or about half the price of Tesla\u2019s previously launched cars, the Model S or Model X.\n\nDavid Kudla, chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, who shorted Tesla in the past but does not have a current position on its shares, said he expected Musk to go back to capital markets before year end to raise extra funding.\n\nMusk said on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday that while Tesla was not considering an equity raise, \u201cwe are thinking about debt\u201d issuance.\n\nThe sooner the company does that, the better shape it will be in, Kudla added, saying he expected more delays and slow-downs as the company ramps up Model 3 output.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that can go wrong,\u201d he added.\n\nYet Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager at the Biondo Growth (BIONX.O) fund, said Tesla\u2019s rich valuation should allow the company to raise additional capital if necessary without overly-diluting its share price.\n\nHe said he had been trimming his holding in the company not over concern with its fundamentals, but to prevent it from becoming too large a position in his portfolio.\n\n\u201cPeople want the car. They will definitely sell it. It\u2019s just a matter of whether they can make it fast enough,\u201d he said.",
