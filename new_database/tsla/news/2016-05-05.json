        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two top manufacturing executives are leaving Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) as the Silicon Valley electric-car maker prepares to launch its first mass-market car, the Model 3, and sharply ramp up production.\n\nThe departures follow a rocky production start for the company\u2019s Model X sport utility vehicle, a technology-heavy crossover that faced problems including parts shortages and quality issues, such as non-fastening doors.\n\nTesla\u2019s vice president of production, Greg Reichow, has chosen to take a leave of absence for a \u201cwell-earned break,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said. Chief Executive Elon Musk said Reichow and his team deserved credit for \u201cbuilding an all-new manufacturing organization from the ground up\u201d and making the Model S sedan and Model X a reality.\n\nReichow, who has led production for the past three years and has been employed for five years at Tesla, will stay on until a successor is found to ensure a \u201csmooth handoff,\u201d the company said.\n\nTesla also confirmed its vice president of manufacturing, Josh Ensign, has left the company.\n\nTesla says the Model X issues have been resolved and production of the SUV, which began deliveries in September, is now on track.\n\nThe company hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles annually by 2020, led by its hotly anticipated Model 3, which is to be priced around $35,000 and due to begin production at the end of 2017.\n\nSome analysts question whether the company will be able to handle a ten-fold increase in production, given demand for the Model 3, which has already received more than 325,000 reservations in the month following its unveiling on March 31.\n\nTesla is due to announce first-quarter results later on Wednesday.",
