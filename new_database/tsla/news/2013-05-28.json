Which is why Musk promised a month ago to bring out models for the average American car buyer.\n\nAnd today, he said, that car would compete with vehicles like the Leaf \u2014 the cheapest electric vehicle on the market, at just under $30,000.\n\nTesla stock has had an amazing three months, blasting above $100 from the low $30s just in March:\n\nPart of the stock run-up is probably due to the fact that Tesla is in some sense the last man standing.\n\nCompetitor Fisker went belly-up in April after burning through $1.4 billion in federal and private money, spending $900,000 for each vehicle it produced, and losing its co-founder, chairman, and designer Henrik Fisker. Lesser-known Better Place burned through $850 million trying to build battery-swapping stations for electric vehicles. And the big-name car companies haven\u2019t exactly seized the electric opportunity with both hands, with slow sales of most models.\n\nSo now, with a market cap in excess of $12 billion, Tesla is worth almost a quarter of the venerable General Motors.\n\nThat might not be sustainable, but it is a bet by Wall Street that electric \u2014 and green \u2014 is the future of transportation.",
