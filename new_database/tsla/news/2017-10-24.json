It\u2019s too exuberant for me right now,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nHe also said that U.S. ride services company Lyft was better priced than rival Uber when his investment firm Kingdom Holding bought into Lyft.\n\n\u201cWe thought Lyft was a better entry point for us because at that time Uber\u2019s price was at the high side,\u201d he said, adding that Uber was \u201cstill a great company.\u201d",
