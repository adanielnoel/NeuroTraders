(bit.ly/2tGqDBS)\n\nIn April, the magazine, which provides an annual rating of vehicles sold in the United States, lowered its rating on the Model S, noting that Tesla\u2019s last software update for the emergency braking system was not adequate.\n\nThe previous update activated AEB on vehicles on speeds up to 28 miles per hour (mph), far lower than the 90 mph limit for the prior AEB system included on older vehicles.\n\nConsumer Reports said at the time the sedan lost its top ranking in the ultra-luxury car category for failing to install the feature that it had promised to owners as standard equipment.\n\nThe magazine awards extra points to the overall score to vehicles that provide automatic braking as a standard feature across all trims.",
