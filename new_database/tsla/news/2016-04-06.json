My idea is to bring a Tesla factory.\u201d\n\nThe outspoken minister, who has courted controversy before with off-the-cuff statements, said she had mentioned the idea to Musk himself and would see Tesla\u2019s management in 10 days.\n\n\u201cI said to him: \u2018I have a place for you, Fessenheim\u2019. He didn\u2019t say no,\u201d Royal said. \u201cWho dares, wins,\u201d she said.\n\nRoyal\u2019s staff did not return a request from Reuters for comment.\n\nFrench utility EDF (EDF.PA) says it employs 850 people at the Fessenheim site and 250 contractors.\n\nFrance has been a big supporter of electric cars, offering a bonus of up to 10,000 euros ($11,000) for the purchase of such cars and making the country the biggest market in Europe.\n\nRoyal herself invested public funds in a now-defunct electric car maker when she was head of a French region.\n\nTesla\u2019s Musk said he wanted to build a factory in Europe and mentioned Alsace in a video published by the specialist car website Automobile Propre in February.\n\n\u201cThis is idle speculation, but maybe we could put a factory in Alsace, it\u2019s like half in Germany, half in France, something like that,\u201d Musk said in the video.",
