        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla is demonstrating how its electric cars can generate valuation staying power. Chief Executive Elon Musk oversaw a loss that missed Wall Street expectations by a country mile, even as the top line clocked in ahead of forecasts. More importantly, he\u2019s vowing that annual Model 3 production alone can meet the company\u2019s full target by the end of next year.\n\nMusk has made a habit of missing goals in the past. Good executives do learn from their mistakes and Tesla has taken several steps to try to bulk up its facilities, including buying automated manufacturing firm Grohmann Engineering six months ago. Deliveries of 25,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in the first three months of the year were 69 percent higher than a year ago.\n\nGrowing from the 76,000 that rolled off the line last year to a run rate of half a million in 2018 would be a big shift, however. There are already signs of internal friction: Klaus Grohmann, who founded the eponymous firm Tesla acquired, was ousted last month after clashing with Musk over strategy, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed source.\n\nTaking the Model 3 from scratch \u2013 the first customer-ready cars are due this summer \u2013 to a run rate of half a million within 18 months would mark an astounding feat. Even if Musk can pull it off, there are potential problems.\n\nFirst, the margins on a car with a base price of $35,000 will be much lower than ones on the Models S and X, which fetch at least $80,000 apiece. Even with mass production, Tesla is unlikely to achieve pre-tax margins much better than the 10 percent to 12 percent to which the likes of Daimler and BMW typically aspire.\n\nSecond, competition is heating up. At the luxury end, Jaguar is set to start selling its I-Pace next year, while GM\u2019s Chevy Bolt, a Model 3 competitor, hit the market last November. Plenty of others are joining the fray, too. That could very well crimp Tesla\u2019s sales or profitability \u2013 or both.\n\nAt almost 26 times 2020 estimates, Tesla\u2019s stock is trading at a level implying Silicon Valley-style margins of 30 percent and near-perpetual vehicle-sales growth. Despite Musk\u2019s undeniable kinetic energy, that\u2019s simply unjustifiable.\n\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Electric-car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue that more than doubled, and while saying the upcoming Model 3 was on schedule for July, it downplayed the mass-market vehicle to give a sales pitch for its more expensive Model S.\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla. But skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year in 2018, or six times Tesla\u2019s 2016 production.\n\nShares were down about 2 percent in after-hours trade following the results.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s comments underscored the additional challenge of keeping up demand for its older models.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confused\u201d that Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S, Musk said on a conference call.\n\nTesla said it had $4 billion of cash on hand as it headed into the second quarter and expects year-to-date capital expenditures to be slightly over $2 billion by the time it starts Model 3 production - within its previous targeted range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.\n\nThat cushion should give the company some near-term breathing room from needing to tap Wall Street for cash, said CFRA Research analyst Efraim Levy. Tesla in March raised $1.2 billion from the markets.\n\nRecord deliveries helped Tesla boost its revenue to $2.7 billion in the quarter, but a net loss net widened to $330.3 million from $282.3 million a year earlier, largely driven by its SolarCity acquisition.\n\nTesla has much riding on the Model 3, which could finally make the cash-hemorrhaging automaker profitable. But while much of the company hype has focused on the car due in July, Tesla on Wednesday made a sales pitch for its overshadowed Model S.\n\nTesla is anxious that the $35,000 Model 3 - which will likely not be delivered in volume until 2018 - avoids cannibalizing the higher-margin Model S, which lists at about double the starting price.\n\nIn its earnings release, Tesla stated that a key challenge for the company would be to eliminate misperceptions about the differences between the Model S and the Model 3.\n\n\u201cWe want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version three of our car. Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features,\u201d Musk said on a conference call, adding buyers erroneously thought the Model 3 would be more advanced.\n\n\u201cThe Model S will be better than Model 3,\u201d he added. \u201cAs it should be, as it\u2019s a more expensive car.\u201d\n\nTesla needs to ramp up for a deluge of Model 3 customers, and the company said it would be adding nearly 100 retail, delivery and service locations worldwide, representing a 30 percent increase. Tesla also said it was also working to improve efficiency, citing vehicle repair times that have fallen by 35 percent due to the use of remote diagnostics.\n\nThe company reiterated its forecast of delivering 47,000-50,000 Model S and Model X cars in the first half of 2017, a target it announced earlier this year.\n\nStill, customer deposits fell 7 percent in the quarter, which could suggest interest in Tesla\u2019s current product line, the Model S and Model X, is decreasing.\n\nOn a per-share basis, Tesla\u2019s net loss narrowed to $2.04 from $2.13.\n\nExcluding items, the company lost $1.33 per share. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 81 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nTesla\u2019s results reflect the first full quarter that includes solar panel installer SolarCity, which it bought last year.\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based automaker last month became the most valuable U.S. carmaker by market capitalization, pulling ahead of Detroit\u2019s auto heavyweights Ford Motor Co (F.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N).\n\nUp to Wednesday\u2019s close, shares of Tesla had risen 45.6 percent this year.",

Greenlight did not disclose its current position on Tesla.\n\nThe fund\u2019s basket of shorts against what it considers to be bubble stocks, including Tesla, hurt its performance during the quarter, Einhorn said on an earnings conference call for Greenlight Capital Re Ltd, the insurer where he oversees its investment portfolio.\n\nEinhorn also discussed General Motors Co, its biggest long position, but the automaker\u2019s shares rose just 1.5 percent during the first three months of this year. \u201cGM trades at a significant discount to its intrinsic value despite the company\u2019s strong operating performance,\u201d Einhorn said.\n\nIn March, Greenlight announced a plan for GM to \u201cunlock substantial shareholder value\u201d by splitting its common into two classes of common equity.\n\nEinhorn said by placing what Greenlight believes are conservative valuations on each component, \u201cit\u2019s easy to get a value that is 27 percent to 79 percent higher than the current share price.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe generally avoid public activism, but in this case management has misrepresented our idea, and we think our fellow shareholders deserve an opportunity of new way the merits of our plan for themselves,\u201d Einhorn said.\n\nFor its part, Einhorn suggested that Tesla remained a short position for Greenlight.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, investors remain hypnotized by Tesla\u2019s CEO,\u201d Einhorn said. \u201cWe\u2019re skeptical that the company will be able to mass market its Model 3 at volumes and margins and justify the current valuation.\u201d\n\nModel 3, Tesla\u2019s third-generation car, is on track for volume production by September, Musk said in February.
