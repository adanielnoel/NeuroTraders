In the past month, short bets against Tesla fell by over $1 billion, but are still above $6 billion, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.\n\n\u201cThis is not just day traders coming in and out of the market. This is fundamental guys who have put it in their portfolio and are saying, \u2018We don\u2019t believe this valuation is correct,'\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3\u2019s head of research.\n\nVilas Capital Management Chief Executive John Thompson, one of those short sellers, said he believes investors underestimate the hurdles Tesla faces trying to rapidly increase production, including the cost to build future high-end robotic assembly lines.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to spend an enormous amount of money on capital expenditures to achieve their long-term goals and they don\u2019t have the money because they don\u2019t have the earnings,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo they\u2019re going to have to sell stock to finance it.\u201d\n\nMusk has promised to turn Tesla\u2019s first net profit by the fourth quarter. After selling 52,000 cars last year, Tesla aims to sell 500,000 annually by 2020.\n\nBut its stock price suggests investors expect even more aggressive growth.\n\nIf Tesla shares were to grow 10 percent a year for the next 10 years - not unreasonable for a popular growth company - it would have to reach annual sales of 1.5 million cars at triple GM\u2019s typical $1,000-per-car profit to justify a more moderate price-earnings ratio of 20. Last year GM sold 10 million cars and Ford sold 6.6 million.\n\nTesla could make money in the future selling batteries or autonomous vehicles, but its valuation is questionable nonetheless and leaves no allowance for operational setbacks, said Georgetown University business professor James Angel.\n\n\u201cThis stock is definitely priced to perfection. If he pulls everything off, it\u2019s probably worth its current value, but there\u2019s a huge amount of execution risk here,\u201d Angel said.\n\nRecent problems like malfunctioning doors and glitchy sensors have cast light on the difficulty of quickly expanding production as Tesla prepares to launch its Model 3 sedan next year.\n\nWhen it reports first-quarter results on Wednesday, analysts will watch to see whether it is on track to deliver positive cash flow for 2016 and become profitable.",
