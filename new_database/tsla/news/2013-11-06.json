        "body": "A few weeks back at the opening of a Tesla Motors service center in Munich, Elon Musk told a room full of fans and journalists that Tesla would offer a special tuning package for high-speed Model S driving.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense: Sections of Germany\u2019s Autobahn network are among the few roads on Earth with no speed limit. And drivers really do make use of those sections.\n\nOne such driver is Martin Thomsen from EV Network DK, who sent us the video above. It shows just what the Model S is capable of when unleashed.\n\nThe answer is a fairly comfortable 212 kilometers per hour\u2013or 132 mph in old money. Tesla itself quotes a top speed of 130 mph for the Model S Performance (125 for non-Performance 85 kWh cars), so it\u2019s clear to see that the car will do so when given a free rein.\n\nMore impressive still is how the Model S gets to that speed. Starting from around 60 mph, the car takes just five seconds or so to reach 100 mph. The rate of acceleration only really slows as the car passes 200 km/h, or 124 mph.\n\nThat replicates the behavior we saw in a Model S video earlier this year\u2013though Martin\u2019s early-morning run on a section of de-restricted Autobahn near Berlin was perhaps a little more legal than the first video, shot in the U.S.\n\nNaturally, the battery won\u2019t last the EPA\u2019s 265 miles at these sort of speeds, but that probably won\u2019t worry German owners\u2013Musk promised a full network of Supercharger quick-charge stations over the next few years.\n\nThose drivers will also get a faster charge than they do elsewhere, thanks to a higher 135 kW output. Musk believes Germany will become Tesla\u2019s third-largest market\u2013after the U.S. and China.\n\nWhatever your take on top speed runs on public roads, one thing is for sure\u2013the Model S makes going quickly seem almost relaxing.\n\nRelated articles Tesla\u2019s record growth has it struggling with a serious production bottleneck Now you can drive your Tesla from San Diego to Vancouver \u2013 for free Tesla Model S outscores every other car in Consumer Reports ratings Tesla and Samsung\u2019s electric car battery talks get more serious Data is Tesla\u2019s secret weapon against negative Model S reviews",
