By 2020, Tesla said, the plant would be able to make more lithium-ion batteries in a year than were produced worldwide in 2013.\n\nThe company said the plant will open in 2017 and ship batteries to the company\u2019s assembly plant near San Francisco.\n\nThe Palo Alto, California-based maker of high-priced electric cars plans to raise the money by selling convertible senior notes, half of them due in 2019 and the other half in 2021, it said in an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\nAnalysts believe the factory may ultimately cost $5 billion to $6 billion to build and will be funded with the help of some of Tesla\u2019s Japanese suppliers, including Panasonic Corp .\n\nThe plant, which will handle everything from processing raw materials to final assembly, will produce small, lightweight batteries for Tesla and may also supply other automakers.\n\nBattery costs have been a major stumbling block to widespread electric car adoption in the United States, according to analysts.
