        "body": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Contract chip maker Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. CSMF.SI CHRT.O is in discussion with PC chipmaker AMD AMD.N to make chips with more advanced technology, Chartered Semi said on Wednesday.\n\nAMD competes with Intel (INTC.O) making advanced chips that form the central \u201cbrains\u201d of each PC, and uses Chartered as one of its manufacturing partners.\n\nIntel has fought back recently to take back market share gains made by AMD over the last few years, raising concerns about the potential for negative impact to Chartered\u2019s business.\n\nChartered now made chips for AMD using 65-nanometre technology, but was looking to move to even more advanced 45-nanometre technology in the partnership, said Chia Song Hwee, the Singapore-based company\u2019s president and chief executive.\n\nThe smaller specification, which relates to the width of circuitry in chips, allows designers to create more powerful chips by packing more computing power into a given area.\n\n\u201cWe are in discussion with (AMD), there\u2019s no firm agreement yet,\u201d Chia said at a Merrill Lynch technology conference in Taipei, referring to discussions to move to the 45-nanometre technology.\n\nChartered shares were unchanged in morning trading in Singapore.",
