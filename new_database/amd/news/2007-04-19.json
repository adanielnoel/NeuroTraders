AMD.N, saying the two rival chipmakers are changing strategy to move to a more conducive pricing environment.\n\nThe brokerage said it expects valuations for both stocks to rise once it becomes clear to investors that the two companies are settling into a more healthy duopoly -- one with higher average selling prices and gross margins.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric is shifting away from market share goals and towards gross margin objectives. We saw this with Intel Tuesday evening and expect to see the same from AMD,\u201d the brokerage said.\n\nIt raised both the stocks to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\nFTN said it expects Intel to see greater gross margin gains over the year as both companies shift strategy.\n\nThe brokerage noted that AMD\u2019s capital spending cutback signals its move away from \u201ccapacity at any cost\u201d and market share goals.\n\nFTN set a price target of $30 on Intel and of $19 on AMD.\n\nIntel shares rose 1.64 percent to $21.70 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq, while AMD shares rose 4.24 percent to $14.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
