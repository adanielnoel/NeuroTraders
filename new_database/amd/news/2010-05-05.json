        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co is rolling out a back-to-school lineup of notebook personal computers in what will be its largest single launch of laptops featuring processors from Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nHP said it refreshed or overhauled its Envy, Pavilion and Mini netbook consumer lines, and ProBook enterprise PCs. They will go on sale later in May and June.\n\nHP and other PC makers have increasingly focused on design as a way to differentiate their products, which are often comparable in performance.\n\nHP, the world\u2019s largest PC maker by a healthy margin, says it sells more than 2 notebooks per second.\n\nThe company said its designs emphasize etched metal finishes and \u201ctouchable\u201d textures, and allow users to choose customized wallpaper from 12 artists.\n\n\u201cWe took this opportunity to rethink and reevaluate what we\u2019re doing in the design space,\u201d said Stacy Wolff, director of notebook product design at HP.\n\nHP launched new notebooks for its high-end Envy brand, with slot-load optical drives and back-lit keyboards, and cut the entry-level price to $999 from $1,299.\n\nIt also redesigned the entire Pavilion line and added optional AMD chips to a number of models. HP said AMD processors allow the company to provide consumers with more options and lower prices.\n\nHP holds roughly 20 percent of the world\u2019s PC market, and shipped more than 15 million PCs in the January-March period, according to industry tracker IDC.",
