        "body": "(Reuters) - Collins Stewart began coverage of Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and said Intel\u2019s revamped processor product portfolio should enable the company to grow market share and offset macro headwinds.\n\nAnalyst Ashok Kumar said AMD was tracking slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations on both revenue and profit for the September quarter, supported by momentum in servers and graphics.\n\nKumar believes that any gains would come from miscues at Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) as the company would continue losing share to Intel in the core processor business.\n\n\u201cLower expenses could support upside in operating income, but break-even remains a stretch goal,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Intel, analyst Kumar expects the company\u2019s Atom family of processors, targeted at the low cost space, to offset any weakness in its mainstream products stemming from weaker IT spending.\n\nThe analyst set a price target of $28 on Intel and $8 on AMD.\n\nShares of Intel were trading down 36 cents at $21.19 Thursday on Nasdaq, while those of AMD were trading down more than 2 percent at $6.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.",
