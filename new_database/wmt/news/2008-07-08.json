        "body": "TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) plans to sell Samurai bonds in three tranches, documents filed at Japanese financial authorities showed on Tuesday.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s bonds are expected to be three- and five-year fixed-rate bonds and a five-year floating-rate bond, the documents showed.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Securities, Mizuho Securities and Nikko Citigroup are lead managing the deal.\n\nThe bonds are expected to be offered later this month and issued in August, according to the documents.\n\nJapanese institutional investors have emerged from the global credit crisis largely unscathed, leaving them with cash to buy bonds issued in the country by foreign entities -- known as Samurai bonds.\n\nIn the first half of this year, $13.5 billion in Samurai bonds were issued -- the highest first-half volume on record, Thomson Reuters data showed.\n\nThe money raised in Samurai bonds is also providing a key source of funding for financial firms that have found it tough to raise money since the subprime mortage crisis erupted last year.
