        "body": "NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is taking a more active role in the medical clinics that operate in its stores, saying on Thursday that they will be run on a co-branded basis with a more standardized format under the name \u201cThe Clinic at Wal-Mart.\u201d\n\nThe change comes a few weeks after CheckUps, which had leased space in the retailer\u2019s stores, abruptly closed the 23 walk-in medical clinics it was operating in four U.S. southern states.\n\nJohn Agwunobi, Wal-Mart\u2019s president of health and wellness, said the announcement on Thursday was not tied to the recent issue with CheckUps, but the new arrangement could help avoid similar situations in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will no doubt have much more detailed arrangements in terms of who is operating a clinic,\u201d Agwunobi said.\n\nThe walk-in clinics in Wal-Mart stores offer basic preventive and health services, like cholesterol screenings or treatment for sore throats.\n\nWal-Mart had been leasing space in its stores to a variety of independent operators who were then responsible for operating the clinics.\n\nBut under the new approach, Wal-Mart is signing co-branded agreements with local hospitals and medical groups to try to standardize the customer experience in the clinics.\n\n\u201cThe customer in one Wal-Mart needs to be given a sense of continuity,\u201d Agwunobi said. \u201cThey need to be able to know that the promise of one clinic setting is going to expand across the entire brand.\u201d\n\nFor instance, each clinic will operate seven days a week and feature a consistent design. They will also have prominent signs outlining the prices for services and treatments.\n\nAgwunobi said that standardization could allow electronic health care records to be accessed by all Wal-Mart clinics.\n\nWal-Mart has leases for 78 clinics in 12 states, but it will convert the current clinics to the new brand as leases expire. It expects to open 400 co-branded clinics by 2010, with the first clinics opening in Atlanta, Little Rock, Arkansas, and Dallas.\n\nLast year, Wal-Mart said it could open 2,000 clinics nationwide in five to seven years, and Agwunobi said Wal-Mart is still committed to that figure.\n\nWal-Mart said it has signed a letter of intent to work with RediClinic LLC and local hospital systems to open co-branded walk-in clinics in 200 Wal-Mart Supercenters. It has also signed a letter of intent to partner with St. Vincent Health System to open four co-branded clinics in Little Rock.\n\nUnder its previous structure, Wal-Mart received lease revenue from the clinics. Under the new structure, it will receive lease revenue and franchise fees, Agwunobi said.\n\nIt said \u201cThe Clinics at Wal-Mart\u201d operated by RediClinic and St. Vincent plan to accept health insurance plans including Aetna, Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

        "body": "NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - January sales at existing stores rose a less-than-expected 0.5 percent at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and fell at smaller rival Target Corp (TGT.N) as cash-strapped U.S. consumers, intent on buying necessities, shunned big splurges.\n\nConsumers, faced with the prospect of a U.S. recession, loaded up on groceries and healthcare items in January, but Wal-Mart and Target said on Thursday that sales of nonessential merchandise like home goods, apparel and jewelry struggled.\n\nWal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, partially blamed its sales shortfall on consumers\u2019 resistance to using their holiday gift cards to splurge.\n\nRetailers can book revenue only after gift cards are used, and they often count on customers spending more than the value of the cards when they redeem them.\n\nBut Wal-Mart said customers were holding on to the cards longer and often using them to buy food and consumable goods rather than discretionary items.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like we got the pop that a lot of people were expecting\u201d from gift cards, said Morningstar analyst Joseph Beaulieu.\n\nWal-Mart shares rose 50 cents to $49.33, while Target shares rose $1.65 to $52.65 in early afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.\n\nBeaulieu said that while January same-store sales results were weak, they were not as bad as many investors had been expecting.\n\nWal-Mart said January sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year rose 0.5 percent.\n\nThe retailer had forecast a January gain of roughly 2 percent, while analysts, on average, were expecting a 2 percent rise, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nWal-Mart blamed the shortfall on unfavorable weather, especially in the Midwest, and gift card redemptions that were below expectations.\n\nSame-store sales advanced 0.2 at its namesake discount stores, but rose 2.1 percent at its Sam\u2019s Club warehouse locations, where it operates gas stations. Including the impact of fuel, its same-store sales rose 4.9 percent.\n\nSam\u2019s Clubs charge an annual fee and tend to attract shoppers with higher incomes than those who shop in Wal-Mart\u2019s discount stores.\n\nWarehouse clubs like Sam\u2019s Club and industry leader Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), which operate gas stations, have also gotten a sales boost from rising gasoline prices.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest retailer said net sales in the month ended Feb. 1 rose almost 8 percent to $27.28 billion.\n\nFor February, Wal-Mart said it expects U.S. same-store sales to be between flat and up 2 percent.\n\nIt continues to expect to report fourth-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of 99 cents to $1.03 per share. The fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, and it will report quarterly results on Feb. 19.\n\nThe discount retailer warned last month that sales for that month would be near the lower end of its previous forecast for sales to be down 1 percent to up 1 percent.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting the company\u2019s same-store sales to fall 0.4 percent.\n\nWhile sales at Target had been outpacing those at Wal-Mart, its sales have faltered in recent months as its shoppers overlook purchases of higher-margin goods, like cashmere sweaters and home decor, in favor of basics such as food.\n\nLast month, it warned that its fourth-quarter earnings per share would decline, compared with a year earlier.\n\nNet sales for the four weeks ended Feb 2 decreased 16.1 percent to $4.106 billion. A retail calendar change resulted in one less week of sales during the month. Excluding the extra week, it said total sales increased 5.4 percent.\n\nTarget said its sales in January were strongest in health-care and consumable items but weakest in the jewelry and lawn and garden categories.\n\nIt expects February same-store sales of minus 1 percent to up 1 percent. February same-store sales a year ago rose 5.7 percent. (Reporting by Nicole Maestri; Editing by Derek Caney and Gerald E. McCormick and Gunna Dickson)"
