        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) will be introducing new rounds of price cuts every week until Christmas as the world\u2019s largest retailer reaches out and appeals to cash-strapped shoppers looking to stretch their holiday budgets.\n\nAs part of what it is calling \u201cOperation Main Street,\u201d Wal-Mart will be slashing prices on thousands of items that it says are \u201cvital\u201d to the holiday season, like food and toys.\n\nThe move will build on price cuts the discount retailer implemented in October when it offered 10 popular toys for $10 each.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much along those same lines, only it takes the intensity up massively,\u201d Stephen Quinn, Wal-Mart\u2019s chief marketing officer, told Reuters, referring to the new price cuts.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s sales have been outperforming many of its competitors this year as U.S. shoppers -- pressured by high food and fuel prices, declining home values, extremely tight credit, and a weak jobs market -- flock to its stores in search of bargains.\n\nAt its analyst meeting last week, Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott stressed that \u201cChristmas will come on Dec 25\u201d despite the economy and said that Wal-Mart will have the best prices in the market for the holiday season.\n\nQuinn said Wal-Mart has surveyed moms to find out how they are planning to shop over the next eight weeks -- from getting their homes set for the holidays, to buying food for Thanksgiving dinner, to purchasing gifts.\n\nWal-Mart will offer price cuts on merchandise that coordinates with those shopping patterns.\n\n\u201cClearly, this economy has made things tougher for moms and those who are planning budgets for families,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never planned more than they are planning now. They feel like they have to manage the budget.\u201d\n\nShoppers can sign up on Wal-Mart\u2019s Website, www.walmart.com/mobileinfo, to receive alerts on their mobile phones outlining the weekly price reductions.\n\n\u201cThese mobile messages are going to be very relevant to the exact time period you\u2019re in,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nQuinn said Wal-Mart has worked with its suppliers to ensure it has adequate supply of the products it will be promoting. The retailer will be touting its low prices in ads on TV, its Website, on the radio and in newspaper circulars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got more marketing support than we\u2019ve ever had to make sure people are really are aware of all the values that we have to offer,\u201d Quinn said."
