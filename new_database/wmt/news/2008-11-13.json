At Walmart.com, we stand for low prices the same way the stores do. And we think we\u2019re seeing that in the results -- people are migrating to our website as well.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported a slightly better-than-expected 10 percent rise in quarterly profit.\n\nWal-Mart does not break out results for its online division, but Vazquez said growth is above expectations.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve grown at two to three times the industry\u2019s growth rate,\u201d he said. \u201cComScore reported about 6 percent growth for Q3 and we definitely exceeded even our own expectations of that two to three times growth rate.\u201d\n\nComScore Inc SCOR.O said in October that, according to its retail e-commerce report, online spending rose 6 percent in the third quarter.\n\nAmid the tough climate, Vazquez said Walmart.com has looked for ways to cut costs for shoppers. It is now offering 97 cent shipping on more than 60,000 items and it has cut the shipping rate an average of 20 percent on thousands of additional products.\n\nWalmart.com is also expanding its \u201cSite to Store\u201d program, which allows customer to order merchandise on its website and have it shipped to a Wal-Mart store for free pickup.\n\nIt has introduced \u201cSite to Store Express,\u201d which allows customers who pay $29 a year to ship orders to a Wal-Mart store in three to five business days. Shipping time for a typical \u201cSite to Store\u201d order is seven to 10 business days.\n\nTo attract holiday shoppers, Walmart.com will offer deals on its site on Thanksgiving and every day during the week after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of our highest traffic days of the year,\u201d Vazquez said of Thanksgiving.\n\nConsumer have pulled back on purchases of big-ticket items amid the deteriorating economic climate and credit crunch. That has hurt sales of consumer electronics and Circuit City Stores Inc CCTYQ.PK filed for bankruptcy protection this week, while Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) slashed its profit forecast.\n\nBut Vazquez said Walmart.com is still seeing \u201cquite a bit of growth\u201d in consumer electronics sales.\n\n\u201cThis is a difficult time in electronics, but I\u2019ve been pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing going into holiday in areas like TVs,\u201d he said.\n\nShoppers are migrating toward purchasing \u201cvalue bundles,\u201d where Walmart.com bundles popular products together, such as a flat-screen TV with a DVD player, and sells them for less than it would cost to buy each separately.\n\nVazquez also said customers are showing an interest in Blu- ray high-definition DVD players, which Hollywood is hoping will help to jump-start slower sales of DVDs.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing with Blu-ray, as with any technology, ... is at what point does it get to a price point where it can really go mass?\u201d he said. \u201cIs it going to be this holiday? Will it be maybe in some of the day after Thanksgiving sales? Or is that going to be next year? I\u2018m not sure.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Walmart.com is selling a Samsung Blu-ray player for $247.54 and a Magnavox Blu-ray disc player for $198.\n\nSeparately, Vazquez said \u201cnot at this time,\u201d when asked if Walmart.com is looking to expand into online grocery sales.\n\nIn September, Walmart.com began allowing visitors to browse the grocery items that discount retailer sells in its stores. Browsers can then check to see if the products are in stock at a store near them."
