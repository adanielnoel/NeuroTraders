        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget the flowers and candy -- Nintendo Co Ltd\u2019s 7974.OS highly anticipated \u201cWii Fit\u201d video game will debut in the U.S. later this month, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc\u2019s (WMT.N) online division is trying to persuade shoppers to order the game as \u201ca perfect gift\u201d for Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nThis weekend, the Walmart.com homepage will be dominated by the Wii Fit -- a physical exercise program that uses a pressure-sensing board as a controller -- including a link to order the product now, ahead of its May 19 U.S. launch.\n\nThrough May 11, shoppers who \u201cpre-order\u201d the $89.74 game, or pay in advance to guarantee delivery when the game launches, will also get a $10 online gift card to use for a future order at Walmart.com.\n\n\u201cInitial response is extremely strong, and we\u2019re feeling really good about Nintendo Wii Fit dominating the home page,\u201d said Kelly Thompson, Walmart.com\u2019s chief merchant, of early shopper demand for the game. \u201c... We really like the angle of marketing it to Mom.\u201d\n\nThe move comes as retailers look for creative ways to entice shoppers to keep spending amid the economic downturn.\n\nMany U.S. consumers are shunning discretionary purchases as more of their budgets go toward rising food and fuel costs, and they have run out of access to easy credit to fund their shopping sprees.\n\nRetailers now see holidays, like Mother\u2019s Day on May 11, as potential bright spots when cash-strapped shoppers may be persuaded to spend some of their limited cash.\n\nAccording to a National Retail Federation Mother\u2019s Day survey, consumers, on average, intend to spend $138.63 on the holiday -- down from $139.14 last year.\n\nBut the survey also found that consumers will shell out $1.2 billion this Mother\u2019s Day on consumer electronics like digital cameras, digital photo frames and video cameras.\n\nIn addition, while U.S. consumers have pulled back on many discretionary purchases, video game hardware and software continue to post strong sales growth.\n\nU.S. sales of video game hardware and software rose 57 percent in March from a year earlier, according to market research firm NPD.\n\nSales of gaming hardware, software and accessories hit $1.7 billion in March, led by Nintendo\u2019s Wii console, which posted its biggest nonholiday month ever. Wii Fit, to be played using the Wii console, has already has sold more than a million units in Japan.\n\nWalmart.com is seeing a trend toward consumers buying more tech-related gifts, like digital photo frames or cameras, for mothers, Thompson said.\n\nWith Wii Fit, Nintendo is trying to appeal to new video game users, like women and older consumers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see our marketing programs really reach out to both genders and a range of ages,\u201d said Cammie Dunaway, executive vice president of sales and marketing for Nintendo\u2019s U.S. operations, in an interview with Reuters in February.\n\nDunaway said such gamers will still be drawn to the novelty and sophistication of Wii Fit and its bathroom scale-sized controller, which uses sensors to detect subtle shifts in a person\u2019s stance.\n\nThompson said Walmart.com has worked with Nintendo on the Wii Fit promotion and ensuring it has a strong inventory position to fill the pre-orders. There also will be a link on the site to buy the Wii console, as well as other games and accessories.\n\nThompson said consumers can give the $10 gift card to mothers on Mother\u2019s Day since the Wii Fit will not ship until after the May 11th holiday."
