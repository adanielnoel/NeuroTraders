        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) executives still expect the company to post sales growth through next year and gain market share, even as they cut spending plans to weather what could be a deep global recession.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer said on Tuesday that sales growth this year would be at the high end of its earlier expectations. It expects growth next year to be roughly in line with previous forecasts.\n\nThe forecasts made at its annual analyst meeting take into account the recent financial markets crisis and credit crunch.\n\nWal-Mart shares jumped 11 percent to close at $55.10 in a broad market rally.\n\n\u201cIn a time of great economic uncertainty, this company is well positioned to succeed in the future and in the short term,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott at the company\u2019s meeting with analysts, which was broadcast over the Internet.\n\nHe said the retailer has a strong belief it would emerge as a \u201ctougher\u201d competitor when the economy rebounds.\n\nTo manage the downturn, Wal-Mart has cut capital spending plans for this year and next. It is pulling back on opening big new stores in the United States and will instead remodel existing locations or open smaller stores across the globe.\n\n\u201cRemodels are taking center stage,\u201d Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S. division, said on Monday.\n\nWal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said on Tuesday the retailer\u2019s total capital spending for the current fiscal year ending January 31 is projected to be about $13 billion, down from roughly $14.9 billion last year.\n\nHe forecast sales growth of 8 percent this year and 5 to 7 percent next fiscal year. It previously told analysts it expected growth of 5 to 8 percent in each of those years.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart seems to have the right model at the right time,\u201d said Sarah Henry, an analyst with MFC Global Investment Management, which owns Wal-Mart shares. \u201cShoppers are shopping on value overwhelmingly and I think that is what Wal-Mart really owns at this point.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart is building on efforts begun two years ago to jump-start U.S. sales by curbing expansion plans and focusing on improving results at existing stores.\n\nShoppers headed to Wal-Mart are now finding wider aisles, reduced clutter and an expanded selection of popular products, such as pet care items and fresh food.\n\nWal-Mart added 191 supercenters in the United States last year. It now plans to open 166 this year and 125 to 140 next year.\n\nSupercenters are vast stores that combine a full grocery store with a discount store, but the retailer said it has designed smaller centers that are more efficient.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club unit is also pulling back on new stores to focus on remodeling stores and testing new formats.\n\nDoug McMillon, head of Sam\u2019s Club, said the warehouse club operator expects to double the number of locations it will remodel in the next year.\n\nTo appeal to Hispanic shoppers, Sam\u2019s Club said it will open a new club, called Mas Club, in Houston in the first half of 2009. The location will have an expanded selection of products from Mexico.\n\nSam\u2019s Club also said it has opened a smaller store in Kansas to see if it can develop a new prototype that would work well in smaller markets.\n\nSam\u2019s Club forecast capital expenditures of $800 million to $1 billion this year and spending of $700 million to $1 billion the next year. Last year, spending was $700 million.\n\nIt will put $400 million to $500 million toward store remodeling projects this year and next year, up from $300 million last year.\n\nWal-Mart said its international business, which last year accounted for 24 percent of the company\u2019s $374.53 billion in net sales, is not immune from the tough economic conditions.\n\n\u201cThese are difficult times, not just in the United States but around the world,\u201d said Mike Duke, vice chairman of Wal- Mart\u2019s international division.\n\nDuke said the retailer will be changing how it allocates capital to favor emerging markets with high growth potential.\n\nIn the past five years, Wal-Mart has allocated roughly 67 percent of the capital in its international division toward mature markets, such as Canada and Japan.\n\nBut over the next five years, it will allocate roughly 47 percent toward mature markets and 53 percent for emerging markets such as Mexico, China and Brazil.\n\n\u201cWe are building smaller stores and we\u2019re building stores that require less capital to enter a market,\u201d Duke said.\n\nWal-Mart expects total international capital expenditures for its current fiscal year, which ends in early 2009, of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion next year. Last year, international capital spending was $4.6 billion."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) will focus on expanding its international business by putting more capital toward emerging markets and store remodeling projects, the world\u2019s largest retailer said on Tuesday.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after Wal-Mart said it would slow the opening of new stores in the United States and focus on remodeling existing locations to improve sales.\n\nIn the past five years, Wal-Mart said it has allocated roughly 67 percent of its capital in its international division toward mature markets, like Canada and Japan.\n\nBut over the next five years, it will allocate roughly 47 percent toward mature markets and 53 percent for emerging markets, like Mexico, China and Brazil.\n\nThe retailer expects spending for new stores to remain roughly flat this year and next year, but it will put more money toward remodeling efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are building smaller stores and we\u2019re building stores that require less capital to enter a market,\u201d said Mike Duke, Wal-Mart\u2019s vice chairman of international. He was speaking at Wal-Mart\u2019s analyst meeting that was broadcast online.\n\nWal-Mart expects total international capital expenditures for its current fiscal year, which ends in early 2009, of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and spending of $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion next year. Last year, its international capital spending was $4.6 billion.\n\nWith Wal-Mart reaching the saturation point in many U.S. markets, it has highlighted its international businesses as a growth engine.\n\nThe division accounted for 24 percent of Wal-Mart\u2019s $374.53 billion in net sales in the last fiscal year. While sales at its namesake discount stores rose 5.8 percent last year, they jumped 17.5 percent in its international division.\n\nWal-Mart said its international markets are not immune from the tough economic times.\n\n\u201cThese are difficult times, not just in the United States but around the world,\u201d Duke said.\n\nBut Wal-Mart, with its low prices, is well positioned to weather the current climate, Duke said.\n\nThe retailer said that in Japan it expects to operate three distinct store formats -- supermarkets, food and drug stores, and supercenters. Wal-Mart is also becoming \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in remodeling stores in that country to improve sales, and Wal-Mart Japan is open to exploring potential mergers or acquisitions.\n\nWal-Mart also expects to open its first cash-and-carry center in India in the first half of 2009. Wal-Mart has a venture with India\u2019s Bharti Enterprises for cash-and-carry wholesale operations."
