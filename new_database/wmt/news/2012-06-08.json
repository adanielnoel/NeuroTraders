        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has been battered by bad news dimming the outlook for his re-election, but he might find hope in an unlikely place: the aisles of Wal-Mart.\n\nFemale shoppers at the big-box superstore are viewed as crucial swing voters in the closely fought 2012 election, and a pair of recent focus groups suggest that Obama\u2019s attempts to portray Republican rival Mitt Romney as a ruthless corporate raider might bear fruit.\n\nObama\u2019s attacks on Romney\u2019s private equity career at Bain Capital have been widely panned by pundits and even some prominent Democratic allies, like President Bill Clinton. But the blame-it-on-Bain approach might be hitting its mark with Americans outside Washington.\n\n\u201cThe main thing I\u2019ve heard that kind of scares me is ... the whole Romney thing, where all these people, the factories that have been shut down where they\u2019ve worked over 30 years and then they are left with nothing,\u201d said Rebecca W., a participant in the Virginia focus group whose last name was not given. \u201cThat concerns me.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, political strategists deemed suburban \u201csoccer moms\u201d - middle-class suburban women - as that year\u2019s crucial voting bloc. Eight years later, \u201cNASCAR dads\u201d - blue-collar, usually white men - were seen as a key demographic to win over. In recent years it\u2019s been \u201cWal-Mart moms,\u201d who are similar to soccer moms but less affluent. Obama carried this group in 2008, but they voted Republican in the 2010 congressional elections.\n\nPerhaps sensing a branding opportunity, Wal-Mart Stores Inc has financed the political study of its shoppers, although the retail chain had no part in the selection of participants. The moms all shop at least monthly at the retail giant and were screened to exclude strong partisans of either party.\n\nRebecca, who voted for Republican John McCain in 2008 but is undecided now, was among 10 women taking part in a focus group in Richmond, Virginia, on a recent night. She heard the claim about Romney and jobs in a television ad.\n\nFocus groups are a vital tool for election campaigns looking to find messages that resonate with voters. They are usually staged privately, but a small group of Washington reporters was invited to remotely observe sessions in Richmond and another in Las Vegas, which was centered on Hispanic mothers.\n\nVirginia and Nevada are vital 2012 battlegrounds that will help sway the outcome of what is expected to be a very tight election.\n\nWhile some participants admired Romney\u2019s business success, there was a general sense that they did not know enough about the specific policies of either man vying for the White House on November 6, particularly on how they would boost U.S. jobs.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of opportunities for both candidates here. There is good news and also some lessons,\u201d said Margie Omero, president of Momentum Analysis, a Democratic pollster who helped run the bipartisan study.\n\n\u201cI would advise Democrats to continue talking to these women because they are hearing some of the beginnings of the general election campaign but still want to hear some more specifics.\u201d\n\nThe women in both the Virginia and Nevada groups sensed they had little in common with Romney, one of the richest men to ever seek the White House, as the race hits full stride.\n\n\u201cHe seems stand-offish. He really needs to be more connected to the people,\u201d said Karla A. in Las Vegas, who described herself as a Republican who had voted for McCain in 2008 and was currently leaning Romney\u2019s way for November.\n\nRepublican pollster Alex Bratty of Public Opinion Strategies, who helped run the study, said Romney had an opportunity to fill in voters on his personal life story and fight back against the negative ads.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney is not well defined with these moms,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is clearly room for him to develop his credentials, his reputation, who he is as a person with these moms, because they really don\u2019t know much more beyond the fact that he is a business man.\u201d\n\nThe examination was part of a bipartisan study of Wal-Mart moms that began in 2010. The pollsters estimate the group makes up 14 percent to 17 percent of the U.S. electorate.\n\nMembers of the Wal-Mart\u2019s founding family, the Waltons, have so far given $813,000 to Republicans in this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.\n\nWal-Mart employees and political action committees affiliated with the company have so far given $811,000, in roughly equal amounts to both parties, according to the nonpartisan research group.\n\nWomen and Hispanics favored Obama in 2008 and continue to do so after the Republican primary contests that gave Romney enough delegates to claim the party\u2019s presidential nomination was marked by a series of attacks on immigration and women\u2019s reproductive health.\n\nObama needs to maintain his standing with both groups of voters to succeed in November but he has been chided by Latino leaders for failing to live up to 2008 promises on immigration reform and for conducting aggressive deportations since taking power.\n\nThe Hispanic moms in Las Vegas did not echo that disappointment. They said they felt a strong affinity with Obama, America\u2019s first black president, as a fellow member of a minority.\n\n\u201cI feel more connected to Obama than the white man,\u201d said Leanne B., who said she was undecided about November but voted for Obama in 2008.\n\n\u201cHe (Romney) had it easier than the black man, or a Hispanic.\u201d"

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday said he was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about whether women suing Wal-Mart Stores Inc had enough evidence to move forward with their refiled gender discrimination lawsuit.\n\nPlaintiffs alleging the world\u2019s largest retailer denied them pay raises and promotions because of their gender are trying to regroup after the U.S. Supreme Court last year dismantled a class of up to 1.5 million current and former Wal-Mart workers.\n\nThe Wal-Mart workers filed a reformulated lawsuit in a San Francisco federal court in October, saying they were confining their allegations to California.\n\nSpeaking at a hearing on Friday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the plaintiffs could only move forward with a refiled lawsuit if they could show new evidence to overcome the Supreme Court\u2019s criticisms. And Breyer said he had \u201cdifficulty\u201d seeing where the plaintiffs had come up with that evidence.\n\nBrad Seligman, an attorney for the women, argued that they had uncovered enough new facts, including specific comments by Wal-Mart managers.\n\n\u201cThis is direct evidence of discrimination,\u201d Seligman said.\n\nThe refiled lawsuit, which could include roughly 45,000 women, is part of a strategy to bring more narrowly tailored class actions.\n\nWal-Mart attorney Theodore Boutrous argued that the plaintiffs hadn\u2019t come up with anything new.\n\n\u201cThese are the exact arguments the plaintiff has been making for 11 years,\u201d Boutrous said.\n\nThe case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Betty Dukes, Patricia Surgeson, Edith Arana, Deborah Gunter and Christine Kwapnoski, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, 01-2252."
