        "body": "NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), as part of a pilot program, is opening \u201cSolution Stations\u201d in a small number of its Dallas-area stores to offer technology services, like home theater installation and computer repair.\n\nIn a statement on its website dated July 14, Wal-Mart says the stations will be managed with Dell Inc DELL.O and the \u201cprogram provides an opportunity for us to understand more about what our customers need and expect in home installation and technology services, within a specific market.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, describes the program as a small pilot.\n\n\u201cThere are no plans at this time to expand the service outside of Dallas other than to 15 select stores,\u201d Wal-Mart states.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s competitors like Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) and Circuit City Stores Inc (CC.N) already offer technology services as a way to differentiate themselves and cut down on the number electronics, particularly flat-panel TVs, that are returned after customers get the gadgets home but cannot use them properly.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club warehouse chain has been testing TV and home theater installation services, and Wal-Mart has been watching the test to see if it could easily be translated into its discount stores.\n\nWal-Mart said the new program will give it a chance to \u201cunderstand more about what our customers need and expect in home installation and technology services, within a specific market.\u201d (Reporting by Nicole Maestri; Editing by Carol Bishopric)"
