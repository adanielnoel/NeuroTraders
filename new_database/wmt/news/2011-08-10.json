        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc\u2019s Vudu video-streaming service launches on Apple Inc\u2019s iPad on Wednesday, but it doesn\u2019t come with the type of app that\u2019s common on the best-selling tablet computer.\n\nWal-Mart said iPad users can now go to vudu.com to buy or rent 20,000 movies and TV episodes to watch instantly.\n\nOnce bought or rented, the videos can be viewed online or through more than 300 devices including Internet-capable HDTVs, Blu-ray Disc players and the Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3, Wal-Mart said.\n\nSuch services often come with an app that lets iPad users access content directly from the tablet\u2019s home screen. Wal-Mart said a Vudu icon can be put on the iPad home screen, but when users touch it, they will be taken to Vudu\u2019s website to buy content.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an app,\u201d said Edward Lichty, general manager of Vudu. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-browser experience. But you access it in a similar way.\u201d\n\nApple introduced new terms and conditions recently that required publishers to give the company 30 percent of the price of any content they sell through apps. Since then, some providers, including Amazon.com Inc, have changed the way their apps work to avoid sharing revenue.\n\nVudu\u2019s Lichty said Apple\u2019s new terms and conditions were partly behind the way Vudu was launched on the iPad.\n\n\u201cThe economic advantage of not having to pay Apple 30 percent was a factor,\u201d Lichty told Reuters."
