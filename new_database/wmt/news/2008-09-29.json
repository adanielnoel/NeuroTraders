        "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc\u2019s (WMT.N) Japan unit Seiyu Ltd said it will close about 20 unprofitable stores and cut 6 percent of its workforce as it struggles to gain traction in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nBut Seiyu, which became a fully-owned subsidiary of the world\u2019s largest retailer earlier this year, said it would also look to open stores in new regions and consider acquisitions to help it expand.\n\nSeiyu Senior Vice President Ryo Kanayama said targets may include supermarket chains with a nationwide network.\n\n\u201cOperations that are highly complementary with our store network are attractive,\u201d he said at a media briefing. \u201cOur stores are concentrated in the Tokyo metropolitan area. We would look at areas outside that area.\u201d\n\nSeiyu has lost money for six straight years through 2007, hurt by tough competition with bigger rivals such as Seven & I Holdings (3382.T) in a mature market.\n\nSeiyu said it would launch an early retirement scheme likely to attract about 350 employees, or about 6 percent of its total full-time workforce.\n\nThe company said refurbishing its large stores had helped boost sales recently. Same-store sales rose 0.6 percent for the six months ended in June, it said."
