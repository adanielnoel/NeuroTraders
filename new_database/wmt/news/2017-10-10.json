        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it would speed up the process for in-store returns of items bought on its website, just ahead of the busy holiday season, as it looks to steal a march on e-commerce giant Amazon.com.\n\nWal-Mart has been increasingly using its more than 4,700 stores to provide hassle-free shopping on its website - by offering services that allow customers to pick up products ordered online as well as make returns in store.\n\nThe new service aims to drastically reduce the time taken to return an item bought online, as the company battles Amazon\u2019s aggressive moves to establish its own brick-and-mortar presence.\n\nUnder Wal-Mart\u2019s Mobile Express Returns, starting in early November, customers can, for the first time, use the retailer\u2019s app to initiate a return.\n\nThe process can then be completed at \u201cexpress\u201d lanes in a store by scanning a QR code and handing over the item, eliminating the need to wait in queues.\n\nThe new process reduces the time taken for returning products at stores to as little as 30 seconds from five minutes previously, said Daniel Eckert, head of Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S. services and digital acceleration business.\n\nThe new returns process also allows customers to get refunds as soon as the next day. Some items, including shampoo and color cosmetics, will be eligible for instant refunds even without the products being returned in store, then company said.\n\nWal-Mart said it planned to extend the new process to items bought in its stores by early next year, and is working on a similar returns policy for items bought from third-party sellers on Walmart.com.\n\nWal-Mart is investing $2 billion into its online business and has snapped up a number of popular online retailers since last year, including Jet.com.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s shares were up 1.3 percent at $80.02 on Monday."

        "body": "Oct 9 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it was launching a process to speed up returns of items bought on its website, in time for the busy holiday season, as it looks to compete better with e-commerce giant Amazon.com.\n\nUnder Wal-Mart\u2019s Mobile Express Returns, starting in early November, customers can use the retailer\u2019s app to return an item.
