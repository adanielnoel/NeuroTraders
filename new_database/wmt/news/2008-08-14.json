        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is determined to maintain its low prices and its margins despite growing pressure from suppliers seeking price increases, its chief financial officer said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe level of requests that we\u2019re getting right now for price increases is at the highest level that I can remember,\u201d said Tom Schoewe, who joined Wal-Mart in 2000, in an interview.\n\nWal-Mart is notorious for balking at raising the prices it charges shoppers in its stores. But as commodity prices hit record levels this year, suppliers that make the goods stocked by Wal-Mart have raised their prices to protect profits. In turn, Schoewe said Wal-Mart has increased some of the prices in its stores.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to pass along price increases as we\u2019ve received them,\u201d Schoewe told Reuters. \u201cBut what\u2019s most important is the gap in price between us and our competitors, whether that\u2019s Target (TGT.N) or Costco (COST.O) or others.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the world\u2019s largest retailer reported a higher-than-expected 17 percent jump in profit but forecast current quarter results that could miss Wall Street estimates as a boost from U.S. tax rebate checks subsides.\n\nWal-Mart is also cutting back selectively on prices in areas where consumers are feeling the biggest strain on their wallets.\n\nEduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S. operations, said on a recorded call that overall food inflation is running at the mid-single-digit percent level as prices for meat, produce, dairy and bakery items rise.\n\nIn response, Wal-Mart has increased the number of \u201croll-backs\u201d or price cuts in its grocery business, he said.\n\nWhile such cuts can hurt margins, Schoewe said Wal-Mart is committed to keeping prices low and protecting margins.\n\n\u201dWhat you\u2019d like to do with a roll-back is pick an item that might have a margin that\u2019s higher than the category average,\u201c he said. \u201dBy taking that price down, hopefully you\u2019re going to be selling more volume, more units and driving more gross profit dollars.\n\n\u201cAs long as that happens, we feel like we\u2019re doing a good job for our shareholder by generating more earnings and doing a good job for our customer by providing them a great value.\u201d\n\nSchoewe also said the current back-to-school season is going \u201creasonably well.\u201d Demand for back-to-college items is outpacing demand for merchandise for students in kindergarten through 12th grade.\n\n\u201cThe spending around that event seems to happen closer and closer to the event itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you consider that back-to-school is a July and August phenomenon, our results in August are dependent on a successful back-to-school campaign.\u201d\n\nBut Schoewe said the retailer is being \u201cappropriately conservative\u201d in its outlook for its current third quarter.\n\nWhile U.S. tax rebate checks helped boost Wal-Mart\u2019s results in the just-completed quarter, the benefit from those rebates is now fading and its shoppers are once again finding themselves with empty wallets between paydays.\n\nWhile some analysts have said that shoppers have spent only a fraction of their rebate checks and are saving the cash to fund back-to-school shopping trips, Schoewe said Wal-Mart\u2019s customers quickly spent the rebates.\n\n\u201cIf you keep in mind that some significant portion of our shopper lives from paycheck to paycheck, and you consider that they\u2019re living with higher gas prices, higher food prices, higher health care, there\u2019s no question that some significant majority of those checks were spent,\u201d he said."

Wal-Mart denies that it tried to influence voting.\n\nWakeUpWalmart.com said it filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in conjunction with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and other groups.\n\nA spokeswoman for WakeUpWalmart.com said the group has heard from about two dozen Wal-Mart workers in recent weeks regarding comments made by managers about the legislation. A Wall Street Journal story earlier this month disclosed some of the meetings\u2019 details.\n\nAt some meetings, \u201cthey outright said if you vote for Barack Obama this law is going to pass, your wages would go down, you could lose your job,\u201d said Meghan Scott. She added that the comments varied in their directness.\n\nWal-Mart has acknowledged holding meetings with U.S. store managers, where it warned them of the possible consequences of the labor-friendly Employee Free Choice Act that is backed by Obama.\n\nBut the retailer, which has kept its U.S. stores free of unions, denies telling workers how to vote.\n\nWal-Mart opposes proposed legislation that would make it easier for workers to unionize by signing a card rather than holding a vote.\n\nObama, a co-sponsor of the original bill, has called for passage of the act. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain has voted against it.\n\nIn the United States, Wal-Mart operates more than 4,200 stores, including Sam\u2019s Club warehouse locations, and it employs more than 1.4 million workers.\n\nWal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said that if the FEC decides to investigate, it will find the company did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cOur policies are clear and we have communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression they were telling associates how to vote, they were wrong and were acting without approval,\u201d Tovar said.\n\nHe declined to say whether any managers had been disciplined for making unapproved comments."
