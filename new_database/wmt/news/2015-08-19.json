        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reported weaker quarterly earnings and lowered its annual forecast on Tuesday, as it copes with higher labor costs, a squeeze on pharmacy margins and sliding sales at its British supermarket chain.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s largest retailer fell 3 percent to $69.75 after trading at its lowest in 2-1/2 years.\n\nThe results showed how a move to lift wages and other costs have kept Wal-Mart from taking full advantage of a strengthening U.S. economy, although there was a bright spot in its report: a fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth.\n\nNet profit attributable to Wal-Mart fell to $3.48 billion, or $1.08 per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, from $3.92 billion, or $1.21, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nWal-Mart lowered its forecast for the year ending in January to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 from its outlook of $4.70 to $5.05 in February. The consensus was for $4.77 per share.\n\nThe significant cut to the forecast, even as Wal-Mart logged a 1.5 percent increase in comparable sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, highlighted a growing problem with controlling costs, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.\n\n\u201cIt was a big drop,\u201d said Yarbrough, referring to its revised forecast, which included 24 cents a share to pay for higher wages, training and additional worker hours. \u201cI question whether they will even be able to grow earnings next year.\u201d\n\nIn February Wal-Mart had flagged it would spend $1 billion on higher pay and for training, which will weigh on earnings this year. It also warned of higher spending to boost its e-commerce infrastructure as it seeks to close the online gap with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which recently passed the Arkansas-based retailer in market value.\n\nBut on Tuesday Wal-Mart said costs to increase worker hours beyond the February plan, as it tries to improve customer service with faster checkouts and better-stocked shelves, were denting earnings more than anticipated.\n\nIt also said reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers were hurting margins in its U.S. pharmacy business and that wider healthcare insurance coverage generally had led to fewer higher-margin cash transactions on drugs.\n\nAnother problem is increasing \u201cshrink,\u201d a retail industry term for losses tied to various issues including theft.\n\nA stronger dollar took a toll on its international business, which suffered a 14 percent fall in operating income in the quarter. Same-store sales at Asda, the UK grocery arm, declined 4.7 percent, the worst quarterly performance in the 16 years it has been owned by Wal-Mart.\n\nIn one upbeat note, the 1.5 percent increase in same-store U.S. sales beat the consensus for a 1.0 percent rise, according to analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Sam\u2019s Club, its wholesale club store division that competes with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), achieved same-store sales growth of 1.3 percent, excluding the impact of fuel.\n\nChief Financial Officer Charles Holley told an earnings conference call that while lower gasoline prices helped drive sales, the bulk of the gains were due to increased investments in its stores as well as in wages and training.\n\nThe retailer lowered its forecast for opening smaller-format stores, and now plans to open 160 to 170 Neighborhood Markets locations for the full year, down from 180 to 200. It said it was still on track to open 60 to 70 Supercenters this year."

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 trading in its tightest daily range in nearly a month, weighed down by earnings-related selling in Wal-Mart and a drop in commodity stocks on concerns about China\u2019s economy.\n\nWal-Mart (WMT.N) fell 3.4 percent to close at $69.48, its lowest in nearly 2-1/2 years, after its profit missed estimates and it cut its outlook.\n\nChinese stocks fell more than 6 percent overnight. Fears that Beijing may be intent on a deeper devaluation of the yuan pushed oil prices and industrial metals, including copper, to near six-year lows.\n\nThe materials sector .SPLRCM was the largest decliner among the top ten industry sectors with a 0.7 percent decline. Freeport McMoRan (FCX.N) fell 3.1 percent to $9.92.\n\n\u201cYou would think that a 6-percent China move amid the recent currency adjustments would have netted a more negative result,\u201d said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\n\nHe said the market has not found a reason to break lower or test record highs, so \u201cit\u2019s been a rubber-band kind of mentality.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 33.84 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,511.34, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.52 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,096.92 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 32.35 points, or 0.64 percent, to 5,059.35.\n\nHomebuilders continued on a winning streak after data showed U.S. housing starts rose to a near eight-year high in July. The PHLX housing sector index .HGX rose 1.3 percent for an eighth straight session of gains.\n\n\u201cHousing starts was a very good number, with positive revisions, and I think that caught the market\u2019s eye,\u201d said Doug Cot\u00e9, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management.\n\nUnderscoring the strength of the homebuilding sector, Home Depot (HD.N) rose 2.6 percent to $122.80, a record closing high.\n\nTJX (TJX.N) jumped 7.2 percent to close at a record high of $76.78 after same-store sales beat estimates.\n\nDow component Disney (DIS.N) fell 1.9 percent to $106.94 after Wells Fargo cut its rating on the stock and five other media companies, including CBS (CBS.N). CBS fell 1.4 percent to $49.35.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,975 to 1,064, for a 1.86-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,906 issues fell and 890 advanced, for a 2.14-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq was recording 69 new highs and 85 new lows.\n\nAbout 5.4 billion shares exchanged hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets data."

        "body": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Tuesday that lower margins in its pharmacy business had emerged as a drag on profits, as it gets paid less by drug plan managers and as fewer customers pay in cash, since Obamacare has increased the ranks of insured Americans.\n\nThe company warned that the margin squeeze would continue for at least the remainder of the year, although a spokesman told Reuters the pharmacy business is profitable and that Wal-Mart has no plans to sell it or find a partner to share the risk.\n\nThe disclosure comes as retailers weigh the merit of running drugstores on their own. In June, Wal-Mart rival Target Corp (TGT.N) agreed to sell its loss-making pharmacy division to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) in a deal that will see CVS operate the pharmacies in 1,600 Target stores.\n\n\u201cWe feel the decision we\u2019ve made to run our own pharmacies is right for our business and shareholders,\u201d spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday.\n\nWal-Mart said its margins were being pinched by two factors: reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug plans for employers and insurers, as well as a drop in high-margin cash transactions.\n\nWal-Mart lowered its full year earnings-per-share forecast to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 from $4.70 to $5.05. The new forecast includes an 11 cent hit from lower pharmacy margins and other \u201cunplanned headwinds\u201d such as an increase in in-store theft.\n\nOn an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said the pharmacy margins were falling due to lower reimbursement on \u201csome of the main drugs\u201d, without offering further details.\n\nRoss Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said it is likely that Wal-Mart just concluded contract negotiations with a major PBM, such as Express Scripts Holding Corp or CVS, that resulted in lower rates. The trend was for lower rates, reflecting pressure on the healthcare industry overall to lower costs, he said. No one at CVS could be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for Express Scripts declined to comment.\n\nThe drop-off in cash transactions was likely due to more Wal-Mart customers being insured on the back of the Affordable Care Act, Muken said. That hurts margins because managed plans can negotiate lower prices than an individual who pays cash.\n\nPBMs, which manage pharmacy benefits on behalf of employers and healthcare plans, over the past decade or so have consolidated into three main players - Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth Group. The government has blessed these mergers as one way to help rein in healthcare costs, since the big companies have tremendous negotiating power, said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s pharmacy generates $19 billion a year in annual revenue, according to Evercore. That ranks as one of the largest drugstores in the United States, but Wal-Mart is still no match for the clout held by the top three PBMs, which collectively process about 70 percent of all prescriptions in the U.S., Lekraj said.\n\n\u201cWith that kind of power they have in hand, they can dictate what pricing is going to be for the most part,\u201d Lekraj said."
