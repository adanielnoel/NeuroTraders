        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the United States\u2019 top seller of guns and ammunition, said on Wednesday it would stop selling the AR-15 and other semi-automatic rifles because of sluggish demand and focus instead on \u201chunting and sportsman firearms.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart said the decision was unrelated to high-profile incidents involving the rifles, including the killing of 26 students and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012.\n\n\u201cThis is done solely on what customer demand was,\u201d said company spokesman Kory Lundberg. \u201cWe are instead focusing on hunting and sportsman firearms.\u201d\n\nLundberg said Wal-Mart would stop selling a class of rifle called the modern sporting rifle (MSR), which includes the semi-automatic AR-15. He said that class of rifle was sold in fewer than a third of its roughly 4,500 U.S. stores.\n\nThe announcement came on the same day two television journalists were shot and killed in Virginia in an incident that is likely to stoke the debate about gun ownership in the United States.\n\nRetail consultant Burt Flicking saw the move as part of a shift at Wal-Mart under Chief Executive Doug McMillon to pay closer attention to public opinion on social issues, noting the company had raised wages for entry-level staff ealier this year.\n\nHe was skeptical that it had been driven solely by demand, given generally solid sales of guns and ammunition in the United States. \u201cIt shows that the Wal-Mart of this decade is quite different from the prior four decades,\u201d Flickinger said.\n\nWal-Mart recently came under pressure from New York City\u2019s Trinity Church, an investor pushing for tighter oversight of sales of guns with high-capacity magazines. In April a federal court ruled in Wal-Mart\u2019s favor and vacated an injunction that would have required a vote on the issue at its annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in June.\n\n\u201cTrinity Church is very pleased to hear that WalMart will no longer sell the kinds of weapons that have caused such devastation and loss in communities across our country,\u201d Rev. William Lupfer, the church\u2019s rector, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation said demand for the type of rifles that will no longer be sold by Wal-Mart remained strong.\n\n\u201cModern Sporting Rifles are extremely popular with an estimated 10 million of them in the hands of Americans since 1990. Walmart\u2019s decision was based on what its management sees as best for their business,\u201d Michael Bazinet, a spokesman for the trade association, said in an email."
