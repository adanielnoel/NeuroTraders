        "body": "* Less than 500 employees likely to be affected\n\n* Cuts could be announced this week; Walmart declines comment (Changes sourcing, adds background)\n\nSept 30 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is planning to lay off hundreds of people at its headquarters in Arkansas as part of the retail giant\u2019s efforts to pare costs, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nFewer than 500 employees are expected to lose their jobs and an announcement could be made as early as this Friday, according to one of sources, who declined to be named because the move had not been made public.\n\nWal-Mart declined to comment. News of the impending cuts was reported earlier on Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe cuts will make up a small portion of the more than 18,000 people employed at the Bentonville, Arkansas office but fit in with a streamlining effort that has been flagged by Chief Executive Doug McMillon in recent months.\n\n\u201cThere are no cash registers in the office,\u201d McMillon told analysts after the company\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in June to emphasize his focus on stores as the earnings driver for the company.\n\nSpeculation of job losses has percolated in Bentonville for several weeks, fuelled in part by reports on the matter by local media outlet City Wire. Recruiting firms have reported an influx of resumes from Wal-Mart employees concerned about losing their jobs and suppliers have braced for cuts that could have a knock-on impact on their local operations.\n\nThe cuts come as the world\u2019s largest retailer struggles to shore up its profit margins, which have been weighed down by a $1 billion investment announced earlier this year to increase wages for half a million store-level workers and other cost pressures. The company\u2019s stock is down 26 percent so far this year.\n\nIn August, Wal-Mart reported weaker quarterly earnings and lowered its annual profit forecast, hit by higher labor costs, a squeeze on pharmacy margins and the stronger dollar, which has crimped its overseas business.\n\nMcMillon and other top executives are due to present their strategy for the company at an annual meeting with analysts and investors later this month in New York.

(bit.ly/1P6ePep)\n\nSome Wal-Mart department directors were told to cancel travel this week or make sure they come to the office on Friday, the report said, citing another person who spoke with the Wal-Mart employees.\n\nWal-Mart and its units had about 2.2 million employees globally, with nearly 1.4 million associates in the United States, as of the end of its fiscal 2015.\n\nWal-Mart did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.\n\nWal-Mart reported weaker quarterly earnings and lowered its annual forecast in August, as it coped with higher labor costs, a squeeze on pharmacy margins and sliding sales at its British supermarket chain.\n\nEarlier this month, the retailer said that it plans to hire 60,000 seasonal employees to work at its stores in the United States, the same as last year.
