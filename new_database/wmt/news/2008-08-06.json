        "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Carrefour (CARR.PA), Kesko KESBV.HE and Agrokor Group are on a shortlist to buy Russian retail chain Lenta, Vedomosti daily reported on Wednesday, citing two minority shareholders in the chain.\n\nThey have one month to inspect the company\u2019s books and make their final offers.\n\nVedomosti said the contenders valued the chain at around $2 billion, including $500 million in debt.\n\nSources have said shareholders holding around 89 percent of the company will probably sell. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development holds an additional 11 percent.\n\nAn EBRD spokesman was quoted as saying it would decide whether to sell its stake once the buyer and price were determined.\n\nNeither of the global retail giants Wal-Mart and Carrefour have retail operations in Russia, though both have representative offices.\n\nLenta and potential contenders were not immediately available for comments.\n\nOf the four contenders, only Finland\u2019s Kesko has an existing operation in Russia. It bought a St Petersburg do-it-yourself store chain in 2004.\n\nGermany\u2019s Metro MEOG.DE and investment fund TPG had also been seen as possible buyers."
