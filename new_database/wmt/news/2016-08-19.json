The stock provided the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nOil stocks rose as Brent crude touched $50 a barrel for the first time in six weeks after major producers prepared to discuss a possible freeze in output. U.S. crude was trading near $47.\n\nInvestors also weighed up minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting that showed policymakers were divided over whether to raise interest rates in the near-term.\n\nOfficials were generally upbeat about the U.S. economy but some expressed the need to keep their options open in the need of more data pointing to strength, the minutes showed.\n\nWhile traders have almost completely ruled out a hike in September, they have priced in a 41.7 percent chance for a move in December - down from 45.1 percent on Wednesday, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\n\u201cThe market has reached a comfortable level and needs a fresh catalyst to send stocks higher,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.\n\n\u201cThe Fed was less hawkish than the market had expected. They would like to get one rate hike behind them this year because they\u2019ve been too low for too long.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 has been higher in six of the last eight weeks and the market has touched new records on the back of better-than-expected corporate earnings, supportive monetary policy and a robust labor market.\n\nAt 9:49 a.m. ET (1349 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.59 points, or 0.05 percent, at 18,564.35, the S&P 500 was down 0.48 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,181.74 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.36 points, or 0.06 percent, at 5,225.30.\n\nSix of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index\u2019s 0.48 percent rise leading the advancers.\n\nNew York Fed President William Dudley, who on Tuesday unnerved the markets by saying a rate hike was possible in September, is scheduled to give a press briefing at 10:00 a.m.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams speaks on economic outlook in Anchorage, Alaska at 4:00 p.m. ET.\n\nData showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, with initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropping to 262,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 265,000.\n\nTwitter fell 3.6 percent to $19.44 after Evercore downgraded its stock to \u201csell\u201d from \u201chold\u201d.\n\nCisco was off 1.6 percent at $30.23, after the company reported a 1.6 percent drop in revenue and said it would cut jobs.\n\nValeant Pharma\u2019s U.S.-listed shares were up 2.8 percent at $30.81 after the drugmaker said it received approval from a lender to amend its credit facility.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,641 to 977. On the Nasdaq, 1,245 issues rose and 1,006 fell.\n\nThe S&P 500 index showed eight new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 26 new highs and 13 new lows.

        "body": "LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Supermarket chain Asda warned on Thursday a recovery under its new boss would take time after Wal-Mart\u2019s British subsidiary suffered its worst drop in quarterly sales and lost customers to rivals.\n\nSean Clarke, former boss of Wal-Mart\u2019s China business, took the helm at Asda last month after CEO Andy Clarke was fired.\n\nHe has been tasked with defending a UK market share that has slipped nearly 1 percentage point over the last year to 15.5 percent.\n\nAsda needs to win back shoppers from German discounters Aldi and Lidl and from traditional rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, who have all upped their games.\n\nAsda said sales at stores open more than a year, excluding fuel, tumbled 7.5 percent in its second quarter, which ended on June 30.\n\nThe company\u2019s eighth consecutive quarterly fall comes a year after a 4.7 percent fall which its then-CEO deemed Asda\u2019s \u201cnadir\u201d.\n\nThe 7.5 percent like-for-like sales fall was made up of a 6 percent decline in customer numbers and a 1.5 percent fall in average spending.\n\n\u201cThe competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics,\u201d Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said.\n\n\u201cWhile our turnaround will take time, I\u2018m confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we\u2019re addressing this with urgency,\u201d he said.\n\nShares in Asda\u2019s rivals were sent higher by its statement that maintained, rather than increased, a commitment to price cuts of 1.5 billion pounds ($1.97 billion) over five years which began in November 2013.\n\nShares in Tesco were up 2 percent, Sainsbury\u2019s up 2.8 percent and Morrisons up 2.5 percent.\n\n\u201cThere has been much market speculation about what Asda may or may not do to solve its trading woes with some suggestions that a form of retail Armageddon was about to strike the UK,\u201d said Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital.\n\n\u201cToday, we believe that Wal-Mart dispels such a possible expectation, doing as we felt it would. That is outlining a rational plan within existing price parameters.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s McMillon said Asda would also improve product availability and reduce costs.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the culture that has always been at the heart of our success is still there,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel positive about the future.\u201d\n\nWhile Asda has lagged peers in sales performance for two years, it has been Britain\u2019s most profitable supermarket.\n\nAsda said its gross profit was up in the second quarter but did not provide details nor any guidance for the full year.\n\nWal-Mart raised its annual profit forecast on Thursday after beating quarterly earnings expectations."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, saying it benefited from cleaner and more efficient U.S. stores, investments in technology that improved online shopping and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer has been spending heavily to entice consumers back to its stores with better stocked shelves, and improving its e-commerce business by investing in new warehouses that can deliver online shipments faster. Last week, it announced the acquisition of online startup Jet.com for over $3 billion to better compete with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nWal-Mart also increased entry level wages to $10 an hour earlier this year and said it will invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years, a move it said contributed to improved service in its stores.\n\nThese steps, analysts said, helped Wal-Mart to raise its fiscal-year forecast and buck a string of weak results from higher-end brick-and-mortar competitors like Target Corp (TGT.N), Macy\u2019s Inc (M.N) and Kohls Corp (KSS.N). Target cut its fiscal-year profit outlook on Wednesday after quarterly sales fell more than expected.\n\nWal-Mart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said on a conference call that the company\u2019s customers were still cautious with their spending but were visiting stores more often and buying more items. Store visits increased 1.2 percent, and the average size of an order rose 0.4 percent during the second quarter ended on July 31.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a steady improvement in the U.S. business, and it is responding favorably to the changes we are making,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said sales were strong for grocery items and apparel but weak for electronics.\n\n\u201cWalmart\u2019s strategic investments are generating traction, which is especially meaningful, given a large portion of its customer base remains challenged,\u201d said Moody\u2019s analyst Charlie O\u2018Shea.\n\nThe retailer said it was difficult to quantify the effects of low gasoline prices and unseasonably warm weather, but those factors contributed to overall sales growth.\n\nOnline sales growth accelerated sequentially for the first time in more than five quarters, rising 11.8 percent from 7 percent in the first quarter.\n\nChief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said e-commerce growth was stronger in the United States than in major overseas markets, mainly because of its larger third-party seller business and the continued roll-out of online grocery pickup options.\n\nWal-Mart has added 7 million items to its website this year, bringing the total to 15 million. This compares with 200 million on online rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nThe company raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook to between $4.15 and $4.35 a share, including an estimated hit of 5 cents from the Jet.com acquisition, from a previous range of $4 to $4.30.\n\nSecond-quarter earnings per share of $1.07, excluding a gain from the sale of Wal-Mart\u2019s e-commerce business in China and other items, exceeded the analysts\u2019 average estimate by 5 cents.\n\nSales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.6 percent, excluding fuel prices, to beat expectations in their eighth straight quarter of growth.\n\nInternational sales fell 6.6 percent to $28.6 billion but increased 2.2 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Total revenue rose 0.5 percent to $120.9 billion.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s shares rose as much as 2.8 percent earlier in the trading day. They were up 1.8 percent at $74.23 in afternoon trade."
