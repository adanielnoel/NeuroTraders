        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nAmazon\u2019s latest results were so superb they catapulted the online retailer\u2019s market value beyond Wal-Mart\u2019s for the first time. Now, the $250 billion goliath led by Jeff Bezos finds itself in another spot that its bricks-and-mortal rival will more happily cede: defending labor practices.\n\nFollowing a New York Times expose published Sunday on Amazon\u2019s culture, Bezos told his staff that the company described in the newspaper isn\u2019t familiar to him. The article \u201cclaims that our intentional approach is to create a soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize this Amazon.\u201d\n\nThe chief executive, who owns $45 billion of Amazon stock, may be right. That doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t pushed his people in ways considered unacceptable elsewhere. Arguably, that has been an ingredient of the company\u2019s success, and a quid pro quo for the wealth Bezos has conferred upon so many Amazonians.\n\nEven so, the perception of Amazon as a place where staffers \u201ccry at their desk,\u201d as one former executive told the Times, or where engineers routinely take their laptops into the toilet stall, as another onetime Amazonian revealed on Vice\u2019s Motherboard website, could backfire in ways that resemble Wal-Mart Stores\u2019 travails.\n\nAs the Arkansas-based retailer has expanded, it has faced growing legal fire and public scrutiny over the treatment of its 1.3 million workers. Since 2000, the nation\u2019s largest private employer has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines over employees forced to work off the clock or denied breaks.\n\nAnd the claims keep coming. A recent ruling found Wal-Mart failed to pay California minimum wage to drivers, while allegations have surfaced over the years claiming gender discrimination in pay and promotion policies. These costs have been shouldered by shareholders and given the company a reputation that led to consumer boycotts.\n\nWal-Mart is reforming its ways, though. Just this year, it implemented a $1 billion program, including wage hikes, job training and more flexible worker schedules. It also increased minimum wages for many employees.\n\nThe Amazon depicted on the Times front page looks like a crummy place to work. It\u2019s a reputation that carries risks that could hamper recruitment and even hurt its position with customers. It won\u2019t be long before Bezos devises reforms of his own."
