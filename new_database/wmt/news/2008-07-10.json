        "body": "* Paulson, Bernanke to testify on financial market\n\n* All three major indexes sink into bear market\n\nNEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures rose on Thursday as news of an $18.8 billion dollar proposed takeover in the chemicals sector and an increased profit outlook from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) boosted optimism a day after the S&P 500 .SPX slid into a bear market.\n\nDow Chemical DOW.N announced it would buy Rohm and Haas ROH.N for $18.8 billion, a deal that investors took as signaling value in the stock market and evidence that the credit crisis has not totally derailed deal-making. For details, see [ID:nN10461510]\n\nShares of Rohm and Haas, a specialty chemicals and electronic materials maker, jumped 67 percent to $75 before the bell.\n\n\u201cPart of what\u2019s held back the market has been the absence of buyers in the LBO market. So strategic deals are going to have to fill that void for a while,\u201d said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. \u201cThe Rohm and Haas deal is the type of a strategic deal that the market is looking for.\u201d\n\nS&P 500 futures SPc1 rose 9 points and were above fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.\n\nWal-Mart shares rose nearly 3 percent to $59.20 before the bell after the company raised its second-quarter profit forecasts and posted June sales from stores open at least year that topped analysts\u2019 expectations. [ID:nWNAB0274]\n\nThe S&P 500, now in its first bear market since 2002, has lost nearly $3 trillion in market value over the nine months of its decline through Wednesday. It starts Thursday\u2019s session with an aggregate market capitalization of roughly $10.9 trillion compared with about $13.8 trillion on Oct. 9, 2007.\n\nAs concerns about Freddie Mac FRE.N and Fannie Mae FNM.N , the providers of home financing, persist, investors will look for some reassuring words from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson when they testify on regulatory restructuring on Capitol Hill beginning at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).\n\nThe Labor Department will report weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT). Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a total of 395,000 new filings compared with 404,000 in the prior week. (Editing by Kenneth Barry)"

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported a 5.8 percent rise in June sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, beating Wall Street estimates, and the discount retailer raised its second-quarter earnings forecast.\n\nAnalysts, on average, had expected a same-store sales gain of 3.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates, while the company itself had forecast a rise of 2 percent to 4 percent, excluding gasoline sales.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s monthly sales have been outpacing those of competitors as shoppers head to its stores for discounts on food, health-care items and electronics.\n\nSame-store sales rose 6.1 percent at its U.S. namesake discount stores and 4.6 percent at its Sam\u2019s Club warehouse division.\n\n\u201cThe Wal-Mart U.S. underlying business remains strong,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in a statement. \u201cHowever, consumers and small business owners remain concerned about the economy, inflation and, most of all, higher gas prices.\u201d\n\nThe retailer said customer traffic at its discount stores rose in the month as shoppers received their U.S. government tax rebate checks. Sales were strongest in its grocery, entertainment and \u201chealth and wellness\u201d businesses, which includes medicines.\n\nWal-Mart said it now expects second-quarter earnings per share of 82 cents to 84 cents due to \u201cimproved sales results during the quarter.\u201d\n\nThat is up from a forecast of 78 cents to 81 cents issued when the company reported first-quarter results in May. The original forecast was below Wall Street estimates, and Schoewe said Wal-Mart was being \u201cappropriately conservative\u201d given the volatile environment.\n\nThe retailer also said at the time that it was not sure how much of a sales boost it would get from the tax rebates.\n\nBut after issuing that forecast, Wal-Mart reported higher-than-expected May sales results and said shoppers had cashed about $350 million worth of tax rebate checks in its store, helping sales.\n\nWal-Mart said it expects July U.S. same-store sales, excluding gasoline, to rise between 2 percent and 4 percent.\n\nIt now expects second-quarter same-store sales to rise about 4 percent, up from a previous forecast for sales to be flat to up 2 percent."
