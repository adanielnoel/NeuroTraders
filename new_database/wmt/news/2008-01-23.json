        "body": "KANSAS CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) must be a \u201ccompany of the future\u201d that embraces advances such as electronic health records or hybrid cars to drive down costs, keep prices low and tackle issues the government may not be able to solve, its chief executive said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe live in a time when people are losing confidence in the ability of government to solve problems,\u201d said CEO Lee Scott.\n\n\u201cBut at Wal-Mart, we don\u2019t see the sidelines that politicians see. And we do not wait for someone else to solve problems that might hurt our business or affect our customers in a negative way.\u201d\n\nInstead, Scott said Wal-Mart will use its heft as the world\u2019s largest retailer to push for changes in health care, energy consumption and sourcing.\n\nScott delivered the speech at a meeting for more than 7,000 U.S. store managers, which was held in Kansas City, Missouri. An advanced copy of his speech was provided to the media.\n\nHis latest speech built on one he delivered in October 2005, when he first outlined Wal-Mart\u2019s environmental efforts. While the goals, such as one day using only renewable energy and creating zero waste, are seen as a way to help the environment, they also are meant to help Wal-Mart cut costs.\n\nMany of the goals Scott outlined on Wednesday were aimed at helping Wal-Mart strip out excess costs and promote low prices at a time when its core lower-income shoppers are being squeezed by a deteriorating housing market, higher food and fuel costs and a credit market crunch.\n\n\u201cWe see our customers having to choose between filling up their gas tanks or buying food and medicine and clothes,\u201d Scott said, adding that, in the United States, out-of-pocket energy costs for working families have doubled over the past decade.\n\n\u201cThese families now spend an estimated 17 percent of their monthly income on energy. Somebody has to do something.\u201d\n\nHe added Wal-Mart is working with its suppliers to make the most \u201cenergy intensive\u201d products in its stores 25 percent more energy efficient within three years.\n\nHe also said that, by 2010, the retailer wants all its flat-panel TVs to be 30 percent more energy efficient.\n\nOn the health care front, he said Wal-Mart will partner with doctors to increase the number of electronic prescriptions that it fills in the United States to 8 million by the end of year. That would mark a nearly 400 percent increase in e-prescriptions filled at Wal-Mart, he said.\n\nScott also said Wal-Mart will contract with \u201cselect employers\u201d to help them manage how they process and pay prescription drug claims, seeing an opportunity to take out \u201cunnecessary costs.\u201d A company spokesman declined to provide more details on the program.\n\nWal-Mart also will provide electronic health records to U.S. employees and their family members by the end of 2010.\n\n\u201cThese records will be personal, private and portable. They will drive down costs and improve quality and safety,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the wake of a slew of recalls last year of Chinese-made products, Scott said Wal-Mart intends to be tough with suppliers.\n\nWal-Mart will only work with suppliers \u201cwho maintain our standards throughout our relationship,\u201d he said, adding that, in some cases, Wal-Mart may pay more to suppliers that meet its standards.\n\n\u201cPaying more in the short term for quality will mean paying less in the long term as a company,\u201d he said.\n\nIn looking for ways that Wal-Mart could become a retailer of the future, Scott also offered some ideas he said were \u201ccompletely out there.\u201d\n\nFor instance, he has been talking with the heads of the major auto manufacturers, asking \u201cif there is a place for Wal- Mart in the hybrid electric or plug-in electric car market, so our customers do not have to spend so much money filling up their gas tanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe there isn\u2019t room for Wal-Mart in this right now. But something tells me that there may be some role for us in the future and we are going to continue taking a look at this,\u201d he added.\n\nWal-Mart also could try to provide \u201cecofriendly energy\u201d to customers.\n\n\u201cImagine your customers pulling into your parking lot and seeing wind turbines and solar panels, and being able to charge their cars while they shop,\u201d he said.\n\nWal-Mart could then feed the power generated by its wind turbines and solar powers back into the electrical grid.\n\n\u201cJust imagine the impact of our customers being able to buy ecofriendly energy at the unbeatable Wal-Mart price,\u201d he added."
