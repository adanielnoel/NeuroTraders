        "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world\u2019s largest retailer, said on Tuesday that the number of its workers without health insurance has fallen over the last year, helped by new plans.\n\nWal-Mart said that 7.3 percent of its sales associates had no health insurance, down from 9.6 percent a year ago.\n\nAccording to a survey of 802,091 employees, Wal-Mart said 50.2 percent had a Wal-Mart health plan, while 22.3 percent were insured by a spouse\u2019s plan, 4.3 percent by Medicare and 4.2 percent by their parents, school or college.\n\n\u201cWith 690.970 associates -- and more than 1.1 million people in total -- now covered by Wal-Mart\u2019s plans, we can see that the improvements we\u2019ve made are being embraced by our associates and their families,\u201d said Linda Dillman, Wal-Mart\u2019s executive vice president of benefits and risk management.\n\nThe company also said it will commission a study to better understand why some workers declined coverage and to identify things that can be done to encourage them to accept it in the future.
