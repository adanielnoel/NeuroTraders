        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said it will bring forward its holiday layaway program by two weeks, as the world\u2019s largest retailer hopes to get a jump on year-end demand and fuel sales of soon-to-be-launched Star Wars toys.\n\nThe company will kick off the program that allows shoppers to pay for holiday gifts and other products in installments, on August 28, two weeks earlier than last year, Anne Marie Kehoe, vice president of toys, said in a briefing.\n\nIt will make 40,000 items available under the payment plan, roughly a fifth more than last year.\n\nThe move reflects Wal-Mart\u2019s desire to get a head start on a holiday season that is sure to be highly competitive. Toys are an especially big focus for retailers this year, ahead of the December release of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d - the first in a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy being produced by Walt Disney Co.\n\nWal-Mart said it will have 500 new Star Wars products in stores on Sept 4, as part of a global roll-out of movie-related merchandise at various retailers. Wal-Mart will make thousands more items, including apparel, grocery and health products, available online.\n\nWal-Mart hopes the layaway program will ease purchases of Star Wars items, as well as other toys featured during a week-long toy promotion. Besides starting layaway earlier, it is reducing the minimum price for eligible items to $10 from $15 on a minimum basket of $50.\n\n\u201cIn the five years we\u2019ve been offering this holiday layaway program we\u2019ve discovered that customers use it for a whole host of reasons, from being able to better budget their money and avoiding credit card fees,\u201d Kehoe said.\n\nLayaway programs can have a sizeable impact on a retailer\u2019s sales. Retail consultant Burt Flickinger estimates layaway can account for as much as 10 to 15 percent of holiday revenues at Wal-Mart stores in poorer areas.\n\nWal-Mart said it would hold midnight Star Wars events at 2,900 stores on Sept 4 and family events at the same number of stores the following day. Kehoe said she expected strong demand for toys from collectors, besides children.\n\nHelped by the Star Wars launch, the U.S. toy industry is poised to grow 6.2 percent in 2015 to $19.9 billion, according to research by the NPD Group tracking about 80 percent of U.S. retail sales."

He said that class of rifle was sold in fewer than a third of its roughly 4,500 U.S. stores.\n\nThe announcement came on the same day two television journalists were shot and killed in Virginia in an incident that is likely to stoke the debate about gun ownership in the United States.\n\nRetail consultant Burt Flickinger saw the move as part of a shift at Wal-Mart under Chief Executive Doug McMillon to pay closer attention to public opinion on social issues, noting the company had raised wages for entry-level staff ealier this year.\n\nHe was skeptical that it had been driven solely by demand, given generally solid sales of guns and ammunition in the United States. \u201cIt shows that the Wal-Mart of this decade is quite different from the prior four decades,\u201d Flickinger said.\n\nWal-Mart recently came under pressure from New York City\u2019s Trinity Church, an investor pushing for tighter oversight of sales of guns with high-capacity magazines. In April a federal court ruled in Wal-Mart\u2019s favor and vacated an injunction that would have required a vote on the issue at its annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in June.\n\n\u201cTrinity Church is very pleased to hear that WalMart will no longer sell the kinds of weapons that have caused such devastation and loss in communities across our country,\u201d Rev.
