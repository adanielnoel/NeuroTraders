        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc\u2019s online sales is likely to grow double than Amazon.com Inc during the back-to-school season, helped by the Jet.com acquisition and competitive price offerings, industry research body NPD said.\n\nAn aggressive pricing and marketing strategy, coupled with the fact that Amazon\u2019s business has reached maturity in back-to-school sales, will see Wal-Mart winning the online retail tussle this back-to-school season, NPD Chief Analyst Marshal Cohen told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWith Wal-Mart\u2019s new Jet.com investment, I would suspect that Wal-Mart is going to basically be able to increase the growth rate, probably almost double that of Amazon,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nWinning back-to-school, the second-biggest shopping season after the winter holidays, has become extremely important for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as their store operations continue to lose customers to online shopping.\n\nTo close the gap with Amazon, Wal-Mart acquired online wholesale retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in 2016, through which it not only expanded its product assortment and added more than 400,000 customers, but also gained e-commerce know-how.\n\nCohen said he expects Wal-Mart to grow its online sales between 2 percent and 5 percent.\n\nJet.com provides Wal-Mart with a broader assortment of products than what a store has, including timely promotions and dynamic pricing, Cohen said.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s online offerings have risen from 8 million items, at the start of 2016, to more than 20 million by the end of the year. In comparison, Amazon has more than 300 million products.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer has also started offering free two-day shipping on eligible orders, much like Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription program.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s aggressive efforts to take on Amazon seem to be gaining momentum even as other retailers and department store chains struggle.\n\nOnline sales for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart rose 63 percent in the first quarter of this year, faster than the 29 percent growth during fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter.\n\nOnline sales account for about 3 percent of the company\u2019s total sales. Wal-Mart expects online sales growth of 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of the year, and even faster in the next few years."
