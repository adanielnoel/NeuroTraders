        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday said cash-strapped Puerto Rico cannot force Wal-Mart Stores Inc\u2019s (WMT.N) affiliate on the island to pay a special corporate tax that the retailer claimed was discriminatory and violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston upheld a lower court order blocking Puerto Rico from imposing its alternative minimum tax against Wal-Mart Puerto Rico Inc.\n\nThe decision complicates the U.S. territory\u2019s efforts to reduce a $70 billion debt load and restart an economy that has been stalled for a decade with a 45 percent poverty rate. The 2015 tax legislation had raised to 6.5 percent from 2.0 percent the tax for on-island companies with more than $2.75 billion in revenues that buy goods from off-island \u201crelated parties.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart argued it was the only company that fit that description and effectively taxed on items from its own distribution centers but not those bought from Puerto Rican vendors.\n\nA federal court in Puerto Rico sided with Wal-Mart in March.\n\nOn Wednesday, the appeals panel called the tax \u201cfacially discriminatory,\u201d saying it taxes only cross-border transactions between a Puerto Rico corporate taxpayer and a related entity located elsewhere. This violated the so-called \u201cdormant\u201d Commerce Clause in the constitution, the court ruled.\n\n\u201cBecause we want to remain in business in Puerto Rico and to be part of the solution to the current fiscal crisis, we are grateful that the First Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision to strike down this unconstitutional tax,\u201d Lorenzo Lopez, a Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement emailed to Reuters.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s financial problems, spurred by years of borrowing to try to combat economic stagnation, reached a crisis in recent months, as cash reserves dwindled and the island\u2019s own fiscal agent, the Government Development Bank, faced insolvency. In July, the territory defaulted on $779 million of its most senior debt.\n\nThe appeals court admitted Puerto Rico is in \u201cdire financial straits,\u201d but called the tax \u201cblunt and unnecessarily over-inclusive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt essentially establishes an irrebuttable presumption that all inter-corporate transfers to a Puerto Rico branch from related mainland entities are fraudulently priced to evade taxes,\u201d the court reasoned.\n\nThe island\u2019s outgoing governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has called Puerto Rico\u2019s financial situation a \u201chumanitarian crisis,\u201d while U.S. Congress earlier this year passed legislation bringing the island\u2019s finances under a federal oversight board.\n\nBoard members are expected to be appointed in September. Among the board\u2019s powers is the ability to force talks between the island and its creditors to negotiate cuts to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt."
