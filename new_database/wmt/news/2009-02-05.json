        "body": "ATLANTA (Reuters) - Most U.S. retailers reported lower monthly sales for January, although discounter Wal-Mart Stores bucked the trend with a stronger-than-expected increase as shoppers stocked up on necessities such as food.\n\nRetailers as a whole delivered a 1.8 percent same-store sales decline in January. That\u2019s the second-weakest monthly drop since Thomson Reuters began tracking the data in 2000, behind a 2.1 percent fall in November 2008.\n\nApparel stocks posted some of the biggest share price gains, and Christine Chen, an analyst with Needham & Co, said the sector could be approaching a bottom.\n\nMost retailers maintained or slightly raised their guidance, Chen noted, adding, \u201cThat sends a message to investors that maybe numbers are finally low enough and expectations are finally low enough.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s U.S. sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.1 percent, excluding gasoline, better than Wall Street estimates of a 1.1 percent rise.\n\nExcluding Wal-Mart, the decline was 5.7 percent, with apparel chains like Gap and department store operators like Saks Inc posting the sharpest drops.\n\nThe International Council of Shopping Centers forecast that U.S. same-store sales will drop 1 to 2 percent in February. The group said it expects sales to stay \u201csluggish\u201d for six months, but sees the rate of decline moderating later this year.\n\nWal-Mart also said it would no longer issue monthly sales forecasts because of volatile consumer habits, in a further sign of concern over the economy. Instead, the world\u2019s largest retailer will give forecasts on a 13-week basis, four times a year.\n\nTwo other chains, Pacific Sunwear of California and Chico\u2019s FAS, also said they would stop reporting monthly same-store sales.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart follows a long line of companies deciding not to provide guidance,\u201d said retail analyst Todd Slater of Lazard Capital Markets. \u201cIt suggests a significant lack of visibility.\u201d\n\nWall Street estimates for January were already depressed following December sales that reflected the weakest holiday shopping season in nearly 40 years.\n\nWhile deep discounting attracted some shoppers, cooler temperatures slowed traffic in parts of the United States. A drop in gift-card use during January, typically a month driven by clearance sales, also contributed to the weakness.\n\nIndustry leaders are braced for more pain as jobless numbers continue to rise and access to credit remains tight.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect nor do we plan for improvement in customer traffic in 2009,\u201d J.C. Penney Chief Executive Myron Ullman told analysts. \u201cWe believe that the current environment is not of short duration.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the National Retail Federation trade group repeated its call for a series of temporary sales-tax holidays, saying the current U.S. economic stimulus legislation might not do enough to spur consumer spending and economic growth.\n\nStill, quite a few retailers such as Gap Inc, Macy\u2018s, Aeropostale, Ross Stores and TJX Cos raised their profit forecasts.\n\nAmong clothing chains, standouts included Aeropostale\u2019s 11 percent, same-store sales rise and American Apparel, which managed a 2 percent sales gain for January on top of a year-earlier 40 percent rise.\n\nAeropostale shares were up 7.7 percent, Gap gained 6 percent and TJX advanced 10.7 percent. Macy\u2019s rose 5.4 percent.\n\nThe worst performers included Children\u2019s Place, with same-store sales down 11 percent, and American Eagle Outfitters, which posted a 22 percent drop. Department stores continued to ring up declines as mall traffic and demand for luxury goods suffered.\n\nTalbots, which has struggled with declining sales as women over 35 pull back on purchases, announced that it will close stores and cut corporate jobs. The retailer also said it got a $200 million loan from a majority shareholder that it will use to pay off debt."

JPMorgan (JPM.N) gained more than 2 percent, while the S&P financial index .GSPF rose 2.9 percent.\n\nExpectations that the loosening up of lending would boost consumer and business spending also propelled technology shares.

Miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX.N) jumped 4.6 percent to $28.51.\n\nAmong bank stocks, JPMorgan shares rose 2 percent to $24.54. Bank of America (BAC.N) , which earlier had fallen more than 10 percent to its lowest level since 1984, was unchanged at $4.70.\n\nThe KBW bank index .BKX was up 2 percent, after earlier having been as much as 6.8 percent lower.\n\nOn Nasdaq, Apple (AAPL.O) shares were up 3 percent to $96.36.\n\nAkamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O) jumped 17.6 percent to $16.66, following upbeat quarterly results.
