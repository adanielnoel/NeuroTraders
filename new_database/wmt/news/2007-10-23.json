        "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) will spend up to 100 billion yen ($878 million) to buy out minority shareholders in Japanese supermarket unit Seiyu Ltd 8268.T in an effort to turn around the money-losing chain.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer has invested more than $1 billion in Seiyu since 2002, but has yet to see anything more than temporary upswings in sales amid tough competition with rivals such as Aeon Co (8267.T).\n\nSeiyu is headed for its sixth straight annual loss in 2007, which had led to speculation that Wal-Mart would either need to invest more in the unit or that it would pull out of Japan, as it did from South Korea and Germany last year.\n\n\u201cWe have not necessarily provided as strong a value as our customers would like,\u201d Ed Kolodzieski, Seiyu\u2019s chief executive, told a news conference.\n\nThe buyout will put an end to rumors Wal-Mart may abandon Japan, making it easier to do business with local suppliers and lenders, Kolodzieski said.\n\n\u201cFrom a business partner and supplier standpoint, they too should also see this as very positive news, for Seiyu now has the full-backing of Wal-Mart,\u201d he said.\n\nWal-Mart, which currently owns 50.9 percent of Seiyu, said it would offer 140 yen per Seiyu common share in a tender offer from Tuesday through December 4. The offer price marks a 61 percent premium to Friday\u2019s closing share price of 87 yen.\n\nTrade of Seiyu\u2019s shares was suspended by the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday, following reports of the buyout.\n\n\u201cIt really does give (Wal-Mart) the opportunity to do whatever they want to do with Seiyu,\u201d said Roy Larke, editor of Japan Consuming, an industry newsletter.\n\n\u201cThey still don\u2019t have a major share of the market but they do own the number three retailer in the country. They have a much solider base than they ever had in Korea and therefore something to build on,\u201d Larke said.\n\nFor the year to December 31 2007, the company has forecast a net loss of 10.4 billion yen.\n\nHowever, there may be signs of progress: same-store sales showed their first annual rise in 15 years in 2006, although they still fell short of the company\u2019s target.\n\nSeiyu\u2019s Kolodzieski said there were no plans to shut down any of the supermarket\u2019s nearly 400 outlets in Japan and that it was looking to accelerate its renovation of existing stores.\n\nLast month, Seiyu said it would offer early retirement to 450 of its employees, or about 7 percent of its work force. In 2004 the company eliminated about 1,600 jobs.\n\nCracking Japan\u2019s retail market, the world\u2019s second-largest, has proved a challenge for foreign companies, due to fickle shoppers and tough competition.\n\nIn recent years France\u2019s Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Britain\u2019s Alliance Boots AB.UL have both pulled out of the market.\n\nShares of Seiyu have lost three-quarters of their value since the end of 2002, the year when Wal-Mart first bought into the supermarket.\n\nDuring the same period, the Tokyo stock exchange index of retail stocks .IRETL.T has gained about 25 percent."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc cut its capital expenditure forecast on Tuesday and scaled back on planned supercenters as the world\u2019s largest retailer grapples with slowing sales in a saturated U.S. market.\n\nWal-Mart said its capital spending will fall this year and probably the next two fiscal years as it spends less on new U.S. stores, but spending on new international stores will increase and it will forge ahead with U.S. store renovations.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s shares fell almost 3 percent as the pullback was not as extensive as some on Wall Street had expected and investors fretted that the retailer was diluting efforts to boost sales at existing U.S. stores -- which last year rose at their lowest pace on record -- by investing too much overseas.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart was trying to please both value investors and growth investors, and at least for today wasn\u2019t able to really do either,\u201d said David Abella, a portfolio manager at Rochdale Investment Management, which owns Wal-Mart shares.\n\nAbella said some investors would have preferred that Wal-Mart used excess cash to boost dividends or fund share buybacks instead of saying on Monday that it would spend up to $878 million to buy out minority shareholders in money-losing Japanese supermarket unit Seiyu Ltd.\n\nAnalysts and investors have been pushing Wal-Mart to rein in U.S. expansion plans as sales at existing stores, known as comparable store sales, have slowed and it has saturated many markets. As of September 30, Wal-Mart operated 4,114 U.S. stores.\n\nWal-Mart said in June that it would cut the number of supercenters it plans to open, but that has yet to translate into improved U.S. sales.\n\nFor the first eight months of this fiscal year, which started on February 1, comparable sales at U.S. stores were up just 1.5 percent, compared with a year-earlier gain of 2.6 percent.\n\nWal-Mart also said on Tuesday it expects sales growth of 5 percent to 8 percent for the fiscal years ending in early 2009 and 2010 -- down from a rise of roughly 9 percent this year.\n\nTo counter slowing sales, Wal-Mart is again pulling back on building U.S. supercenters, which combine its discount store format with grocery stores.\n\nFor the fiscal year beginning next February 1, Wal-Mart will open 170 supercenters, compared with 195 this year. It now plans to open 140 supercenters in the fiscal year after that - down from 170 it had planned originally.\n\n\u201cOne should expect approximately 140 supercenters per year after that,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Schoewe forecast capital spending of $14.7 billion to $15.4 billion. That is down from June, when it cut its spending estimate to $15.5 billion from $17 billion because it planned to open fewer supercenters.\n\nFor its next two fiscal years, Wal-Mart forecast capital expenditures of $13.5 billion to $15.2 billion.\n\nWhile capital expenditures for new stores and warehouse clubs in the United States should be $6.7 billion to $7 billion this fiscal year, that figure should fall to $4.5 billion to $5 billion by the fiscal year that ends in early 2010.\n\nBut Schoewe said Wal-Mart will still put money toward store remodeling, with spending forecast at $2.1 billion this year, and $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion in the next two fiscal years.\n\nAs part of its U.S. strategy, the retailer, which has been cutting prices on thousands of items, also plans to add new brands, including two new home decor lines, as well as expand its $4.00 generic drug program.\n\nWal-Mart expects square footage growth of about 6 percent for the current fiscal year. For its fiscal years ending in early 2009 and 2010, it expects square footage growth of about 5 percent to 6 percent, excluding any acquisitions.\n\nIn June, it said it expected a consolidated square footage growth rate of about 6 percent this fiscal year and next.\n\nWal-Mart shares closed down $1.32 at $43.93 on the New York Stock Exchange."

It has saturated many markets with more than 4,000 U.S. stores, and its sales at existing U.S. stores, or comparable stores sales, rose at their lowest pace on record last fiscal year.\n\nThe meeting also comes as Wal-Mart\u2019s core lower-income customers are being squeezed by higher fuel and food costs, and Castro-Wright said the \u201cmortgage crisis\u201d and credit crunch were affecting consumer\u2019s shopping behavior.\n\n\u201cWe have a challenging economic environment out there,\u201d he said, adding that the retailer\u2019s comparable store performance \u201cis not what we would like it to be.\u201d\n\nBut he touted the momentum the retailer has in its \u201chealth and wellness\u201d business, which includes its pharmacies; its grocery business; and its electronics businesses.
