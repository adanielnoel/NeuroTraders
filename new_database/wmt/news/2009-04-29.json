Company executives attributed the strong sales growth on increased in-store advertising initiatives.\n\nThe company, with its current 3800-store penetration expects to touch the 15,000 store mark in future, encouraged particularly by the existing 5000-plus store penetration by its acquired Tully brand.\n\nThe company also said it expects a profit of 38 cents to 42 cents a share in the third quarter, on sales growth of 61 percent to 66 percent.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting the company to earn 36 cents a share, before special items, on revenue of $178.46 million, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nShares of the specialty coffee-maker were trading at $60.01 after the bell.
