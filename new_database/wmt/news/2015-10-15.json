        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nWal-Mart Stores is facing stronger headwinds than investors thought. The mega-retailer\u2019s shares fell 10 percent on Wednesday, wiping out more than $20 billion of market value, after it warned higher pay and technology spending would hit next year\u2019s profit unexpectedly hard. Changing shopping habits \u2013 think online retailers like Amazon \u2013 and wage pressures are outpacing the $210 billion company\u2019s ability to adapt.\n\nPlenty of U.S. multinationals are suffering from the strong dollar, and Wal-Mart is no exception. But it was a forecast 6 percent to 12 percent drop in earnings per share for the year ending January 2017 that blindsided the audience at the company\u2019s annual investor day. Estimates tracked by Thomson Reuters showed analysts had been penciling in an average 4 percent increase.\n\nWal-Mart talked about a peak \u201cinvestment period\u201d and tried to sweeten the pill with a $20 billion stock buyback program. Nonetheless, the surprise warning highlights the company\u2019s challenges. Amazon\u2019s relentless rise has forced all kinds of bricks-and-mortar operations to find new ways to lure shoppers. Wal-Mart also faces fierce competition from discounters like Dollar General and Costco, and an ongoing shift of younger workers to city centers and away from big box chains\u2019 traditional suburban strongholds.\n\nTo counter these trends, Wal-Mart has been spending on everything from a beefed up online presence to new services, such as curbside grocery pickup. It\u2019s expanding into new store formats, such as a line of smaller stores designed for urban shoppers, in response to changing customer habits. It\u2019s also aiming for a higher-quality workforce by raising pay for over a third of its U.S. employees, all while keeping prices low.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t come cheap. Executives said operating income would take a $1.5 billion hit next year as investment ramps up. But Wal-Mart expects earnings growth to recover to 5 percent to 10 percent a year by early 2019 as the initiatives pay off.\n\nThe latest slide in its share price means Wal-Mart has now lost about a third of its market value since January. That seems excessive. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth still has unrivalled scale and $13 billion of existing online sales, according to Morningstar. Even with a tough period coming, those are formidable advantages."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc warned on Wednesday that higher wages as well as spending on e-commerce and lower prices would cut earnings per share as much as 12 percent next fiscal year, sparking the steepest one-day decline in the company\u2019s shares in 25 years.\n\nWal-Mart faces tough competition on multiple fronts, from the relentless expansion of online leader Amazon.com Inc to dollar stores and supermarkets fighting for a piece of its grocery business. Its international operations are also under pressure with a stronger dollar eating into sales.\n\nWal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said a $1.5 billion investment in wages and training, including raising the minimum store wage to $10 an hour from $9, were needed to improve customer service and would account for three-quarters of the expected 6 percent to 12 percent drop in earnings per share next year.\n\nWal-Mart also announced a $20 billion share buyback but the drop in its share price wiped out close to the same amount in market value, and the 10 percent drop was the worst one-day percentage performance since January 1988.\n\nThe decline in Wal-Mart shares pulled down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, accounting for a quarter of the 1 percent drop in the index.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer by revenue said it would invest several billion dollars to lower prices over the next three years. That sparked worries of a price war, and shares of rivals including Target and Home Depot also fell.\n\n\u201cWe can deliver stronger financial performance in the short-term simply by running our core business better but that won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at an investor meeting in New York.\n\nThe company forecast earnings per share would grow 5-10 percent in the fiscal year ending in January 2019.\n\nWal-Mart Stores said current fiscal full-year sales would be flat due to the stronger-than-anticipated impact of the dollar. It had previously forecast net sales growth of 1-2 percent for the current fiscal year ending January.\n\n\u201cThe guidance is very disappointing,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. \u201cWhat if these investments don\u2019t lead to better sales. That\u2019s the biggest question.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart is spending $1.5 billion in higher wages and training next year. Greg Foran, head of the U.S. business, said Wal-Mart would add 3,500 managers in the United States to improve its curbside grocery pickup service.\n\nWal-Mart also said it was adding curbside pickup for groceries ordered online to 10 new markets, including Dallas, Miami and Tulsa, bringing the total to 23. It will add another 20 markets early next year, expanding a service it believes capitalizes on its network of stores - something Amazon does not have - and will be a key driver of growth.\n\nThe company is building out a network of warehouses to handle e-commerce, a costly move Wal-Mart sees as essential to stopping Amazon and other rivals from stealing its best customers.\n\nAt the same time Wal-Mart projected slower growth in new stores, with 85-95 of the smaller Neighborhood Markets format planned for the fiscal year ending in January 2017, down from 160-170 planned for the current fiscal year. Supercenter openings would slow to 50-60 in fiscal 2017 from 60-70 this year.\n\nPrice competition was one reason for the slower growth. Foran said that Wal-Mart could not compete with local grocers in some markets, a factor that has played into its scaled back expansion plans for smaller stores.\n\n\u201cTo be completely candid, when we are up against someone who is really good at supermarkets, frankly our fresh offering has not been on par with what it takes to win in those environments,\u201d Foran said.\n\nIt also is trying to spruce up neglected stores. Foran said that the percentage of stores which got a \u201cpass\u201d grade for cleanliness, speed and friendliness had risen to 67 percent from 17 percent at the beginning of the year.\n\n\u201dThat is really only getting us to at best mediocrity. So that bar is now being moved up so that a whole bunch of stores that were green are now going to find themselves red but they\u2019ve all been told that,\u201d he said.\n\nWal-Mart has been grappling with sluggish sales, leading investors to seek significant changes. Wal-Mart is controlled by the Walton family, whose wealth has taken a dramatic hit this year as shares have slid about 30 percent.\n\nThe company announced a new chief financial officer and appointed a chief merchant last week.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s promise to spend billions keeping prices low, coming after attempts to wring more savings from its suppliers, raised concerns for other retailers as well.\n\n\u201cInvestors are anticipating a price war, and I agree with that assessment,\u201d Kurt Jetta, CEO of retail analytics firm TABS, said by email. \u201cThese price wars never work for anyone. In fact, they weren\u2019t working for Walmart even when they had an advantage over Target.\u201d"
