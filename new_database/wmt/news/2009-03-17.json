        "body": "OTTAWA, March 17 (Reuters) - Walmart Canada said on Tuesday it is cutting prices on a string of staple products because many Canadians are staying home during March Break school holidays and buying basics, rather than shopping for extras for their travels.\n\nThe company, a subsidiary of U.S.-based Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N), said its research shows customers are increasingly focused on essentials when they shop.\n\nThe list of staples on which prices will be cut includes frozen and fresh food, food storage containers, household products, toys under C$5 ($3.94) and children\u2019s clothing under C$10.\n\nPrice cuts, which typically extend over several weeks, are introduced at different times to coincide with the the school break. Reductions are already in place in Quebec, for example, but will not begin in the provinces of Manitoba and Alberta until March 27.\n\nWalmart Canada, which operates 312 stores in Canada, said last month that it would slash prices on 20 percent of its products in an effort to attract customers."
