        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reported a higher-than-expected rise in February same-store sales and said it was raising its dividend due to the strength of its business, sending its shares 3 percent higher.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer gave an overall boost to retail sales in February and proved it is pulling further ahead of rivals like Target Corp (TGT.N).\n\nTarget posted a same-store sales decline in February, while discounter Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N said second-quarter same-store sales rose far higher than expected.\n\nWal-Mart also increased its annual dividend 15 percent to $1.09 per share from 95 cents per share in its most recently completed fiscal year.\n\n\u201cOur free cash flow remains strong enough to fund Wal-Mart\u2019s growth around the world, make strategic acquisitions and fund returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases,\u201d CEO Mike Duke said in a statement.\n\nWal-Mart said its February sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 5.1 percent as lower gasoline prices eased some household budgets.\n\nThe results far surpassed analysts\u2019 average estimate for a 2.4 percent increase, and Barclays Capital analyst Bob Drbul said it is clear that Wal-Mart is gaining market share.\n\n\u201cThese guys are doing a great job at their agenda, which is widening the moat\u201d between themselves and competitors, he said. \u201cThe dividend increase is simply gravy on top of today\u2019s announcement.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart said lower gasoline prices \u201csignificantly boosted household disposable income in February,\u201d letting consumers make more trips to stores and spend more on nonessential goods like electronics.\n\nThe average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $1.91 at the end of February, compared with $3.13 in February a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nWal-Mart hinted last year that lower gas prices were working in its favor, saying it saw an increase in traffic to rural and urban stores after prices dropped in October. [ID:nN182460]\n\nDrbul said declining gas prices help discount retailers because they cater to lower-income shoppers, who are most sensitive to rising energy costs.\n\nFamily Dollar Stores said second-quarter same-store sales rose 6.4 percent, above estimates for a 3.6 percent gain, as consumers snapped up consumable items like laundry detergent or soda.\n\nFamily Dollar, which sells most of its merchandise for below $10, now expects second-quarter earnings of 59 cents to 61 cents per share. In January, it forecast second-quarter earnings of 48 cents to 52 cents per share.\n\nThe gas price drop did not give Target the same benefit. Its February same-store sales fell 4.1 percent, although that was better than the 4.8 percent drop analysts expected.\n\nTarget, which tends to attract a higher-income shopper, said sales of food and healthcare items were strongest, while same-store sales in clothes and its home business fell.\n\nTarget said it is expecting a wide range of outcomes for March and April sales, with its estimates centered around expectations that same-store sales for the two months combined will fall in the mid single digits.\n\nFor March, it is forecasting same-store sales to decline in the high single digits, with April same-store sales to be roughly flat to last year.\n\nWal-Mart said that for February same-store sales rose 5 percent at its namesake U.S. discount stores, where traffic was positive for the fifth month in a row.\n\nSame-store sales rose 5.9 percent at its Sam\u2019s Club warehouse division, as customers purchased fresh food, meat and pet supplies. Demand was weak for furniture, jewelry and other big-ticket, or expensive, items, it said.\n\nLast month, Wal-Mart said that it would no longer provide monthly sales forecasts. Instead, it forecast same-store sales for the period from January 31 through May 1 to increase between 1 percent and 3 percent."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retailers posted better-than-expected February same-store sales on Thursday due to a strong gain at discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which said lower gasoline prices had loosened some household budgets.\n\nWhile several apparel and department store and luxury chains posted same-store sales declines, a handful, including TJX Cos (TJX.N), Kohl\u2019s Corp (KSS.N) and Ross Stores (ROST.O), fared better than weak forecasts, as they appealed to shoppers with new fashions and attractive prices.\n\nHowever, analysts cautioned that February did not mark a turnaround for retailers. U.S. store chains will need to show consistent improvement in the coming months for expectations to change, they said.\n\n\u201cWe would want to see several more months along this line to come out and say we\u2019ve made a turn here,\u201d said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.\n\nShares of Wal-Mart, which also raised its annual dividend by 15 percent on Thursday, rose 2.7 percent. The wider Standard & Poor\u2019s Retail Index .RLX fell 3.6 percent following a warning by General Motors Corp (GM.N) about potential bankruptcy that spooked the market as a whole.\n\nRetailers posted a surprise 0.3 percent increase in overall February same-store sales, against Wall Street expectations for a 1.2 percent drop, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe increase was mostly due to Wal-Mart, which posted a greater-than-expected 5.1 rise in same-store sales. Excluding Wal-Mart, same-store sales fell 4.7 percent compared with expectations for a 4.8 percent drop.\n\nU.S. consumers have suffered in the past year from job losses, tighter credit and a weak housing market, which have forced them to save money by shopping at discount stores and sticking to basic purchases like food.\n\n\u201cWe believe falling gas prices significantly boosted household disposable income in February and therefore allowed for both more trips and more spending toward discretionary categories,\u201d Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Eduardo Castro-Wright said.\n\nPointing to more sales pressure ahead, the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) forecast U.S. same-store sales to be flat to down 1 percent in March and said it expects April to be a little weaker than March.\n\nShoppers\u2019 frugality has helped discounters such as Wal-Mart and warehouse clubs like Costco and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club BJ.N, whose results have outpaced other chains in the past year.\n\nBut even BJ\u2019s and Costco posted disappointing same-store sales on Wednesday compared with a year ago, when consumers flocked to their fuel stations to beat high gas prices.\n\nFor February, BJ\u2019s reported a 0.6 percent increase in same-store sales, while Costco posted a 3 percent decline, both below expectations, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.\n\nBy contrast, discounters, apparel and department store chains continued to face some of the steepest sales declines, with apparel down 5.6 percent on a yearly basis and department store chains declining 9 percent.\n\nBut same-store sales at off-price chains Ross, with a 1 percent increase, and TJX, which was flat, were better than expected, while others, like apparel chains Gap Inc (GPS.N) and Limited Brands LTD.N, topped Wall Street forecasts.\n\nAnalysts said better weather and new spring merchandise in stores helped apparel sales a bit during February.\n\n\u201cApparel is a low-ticket item, so if you get the fashion right, it is not something that you have to extend credit on too far to inspire people to shop,\u201d said Sarah Henry, a retail analyst with MFC Global Investment Management.\n\nTeen clothing retailer Aeropostale ARO.N posted an 11 percent rise in same-store sales, which was better than expected, while rival Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF.N) faced a disappointing 30 percent decline.\n\nGap, with its Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, posted a smaller-than-expected 12 percent decline in same-store sales. Limited, with brands such as Victoria\u2019s Secret, narrowly beat expectations, with a 7 percent same-store sales decline.\n\nAmong department stores, upscale chains Saks Inc SKS.N and Nordstrom (JWN.N) suffered the most, posting disappointing drops of 26 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively.\n\n\u201cMost of those stores are exclusively discretionary spends,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cThey really have nothing in there that consumers absolutely must have.\u201d\n\nWhile February is not seen as a key month of sales, given its place between post-holiday and early spring shopping periods, it could show how willing shoppers are to spend without the motivation of gift-giving.\n\nMoreover, this year\u2019s Easter holiday falls in April, which could hurt some same-store sales for March. Ross Stores, for instance, called out the shift for an expected 4 percent to 6 percent same-store sales decline in March.\n\nJudging by the month\u2019s results, analysts still expect overall sales in coming months to remain limp.\n\n\u201cThe story we\u2019re most comfortable with is that we\u2019re still struggling as a retail industry here,\u201d ICSC chief economist Michael Niemira said. \u201cFebruary may ultimately tell some stories for the spring, but I think the performance will remain weak in the near term.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Place (PLCE.O) shares were up 15 percent at $20.45, while Saks slid 5.7 percent to $2.00 and Abercrombie shares fell 13.2 percent to $18.17 shortly before the market close."
