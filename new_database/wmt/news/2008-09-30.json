        "body": "NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said on Tuesday it is requiring its suppliers to stop sourcing cotton from Uzbekistan, in an effort to end child labor there.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s move follows similar steps from retailers including British grocery chain Tesco Plc (TSCO.L) and department store chain Debenhams (DEB.L), which have already banned Uzbek cotton in products they sell.\n\nWal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, said instructions to suppliers to stop buying cotton and cotton materials from Uzbekistan came after months of work with industry trade associations, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and socially responsible investment groups.\n\n\u201cWe have formed an unprecedented coalition, representing 90 percent of the U.S. purchases of cotton and cotton-based merchandise, to bring these appalling child labor conditions to an end,\u201d said Rajan Kamalanathan, Wal-Mart\u2019s vice president of ethical standards.\n\nThe Central Asian country of Uzbekistan is among the world\u2019s top cotton exporters.\n\nA Wal-Mart spokesman said it is unclear how much cotton its suppliers get from Uzbekistan, since the retailer only buys finished clothes. Wal-Mart\u2019s requirement to its suppliers is effective immediately, the spokesman said.\n\nSwedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz (HMb.ST) has also joined the chorus speaking out against Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton production, saying it supports UNICEF\u2019s steps to prevent child labor in the cotton industry in Uzbekistan.\n\nWal-Mart said four industry trade groups, including the National Retail Federation, sent a letter to the Embassy of Uzbekistan on Aug. 18 asking for an end to forced child labor in cotton harvesting. The Uzbekistan government responded on Sept. 12 by outlining steps to stop child labor, Wal-Mart said.\n\nWal-Mart will revisit its decision once it can verify those steps, the retailer said in a statement.
