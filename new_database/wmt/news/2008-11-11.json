        "body": "Nov 11 (Reuters) - Wachovia Capital Markets raised its third-quarter earnings estimate for Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on solid sales performance, but trimmed its fourth-quarter view to reflect emerging foreign exchange headwinds and less share buyback activity.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s largest retailer, which is scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Thursday, closed down 43 cents at $54.75 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWachovia, which kept its \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the stock, raised its third-quarter earnings view for the discount-chain retailer by a cent to 76 cents.\n\nIt sees fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.08, down from its prior view of $1.10.
