A three-day Washington visit by a top-level Chinese delegation last week ended with little progress evident on the thorniest points in a troubled trans-Pacific trade relationship.\n\nWal-Mart directly sources about $9 billion in goods from China, a spokeswoman for the retailer said. In the past, the company has said another $9 billion reach Wal-Mart stores through suppliers who also buy goods manufactured in China, but the spokeswoman declined comment on that second figure on Thursday.\n\nA spokesman said Wal-Mart\u2019s commitment to buying from American suppliers -- cited in a 1985 memo from Walton distributed by WakeUpwalMart.com to reporters attending the company\u2019s annual meeting and media day -- has not changed.\n\n\u201cHowever, today we\u2019re a global company and it is necessary to source globally to ensure that we meet the needs and wants of our customers,\u201d said Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar."

        "body": "FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) said on Friday it will cut the number of supercenters it plans to open this year by as much as 30 percent as it tries to boost sales at U.S. stores, sending it shares up 4 percent.\n\nChief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe, who also said the world\u2019s biggest retailer will buy back $15 billion of its own stock, made the eagerly awaited comments at the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.\n\nAnalysts and investors have pushed Wal-Mart to rein in U.S. expansion plans as sales at its existing stores, known as comparable store sales, have slowed and it has saturated many markets.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price has fallen 23 percent since Lee Scott was named chief executive in 2000.\n\n\u201cOur (comparable) store sales aren\u2019t at the level that they need to be,\u201d Schoewe told reporters after the meeting, but he said reducing supercenter openings should change that.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s supercenters pair full-scale grocery stores with its traditional discount store format. Thanks to its supercenters, Wal-Mart is the largest U.S. seller of food.\n\nThe retailer, which had 2,307 U.S. supercenters at the end of April, said it now expects to open 190 to 200 supercenters this fiscal year, down from its previous plan of 265 to 270.\n\nStarting next fiscal year, the company expects to open 170 supercenters annually, Schoewe said.\n\nSupermarket stocks rallied following the announcement, with Safeway Inc.\u2019s SWY.N up more than 5 percent and Kroger Co. (KR.N), the largest U.S. grocery chain, rising 3.6 percent.\n\nWal-Mart has struggled in recent months with its U.S. comparable-store sales, reporting a drop of 3.5 percent in April -- the largest fall since it began reporting the figures in 1979.\n\nIt has blamed the poor figures on merchandising missteps, such as offering trendy clothes that customers rejected, and store remodeling activity, which it said disrupted shoppers.\n\nWall Street has said that Wal-Mart would have a better chance of improving sales if it cut back on its square-footage growth and concentrated on improving existing stores.\n\n\u201cWe believe our plan will improve sales growth,\u201d Scott said at the meeting.\n\nCompany executives said on Friday that Wal-Mart went too far with some of its fashion offerings and needed to \u201cearn the right\u201d to sell higher-price goods to its shoppers, instead of putting them in stores and assuming they will sell.\n\nLast year, Wal-Mart downplayed its discount roots to try to expand its image beyond that of a low-priced retailer.\n\nIt stocked more upscale items like organic food, plasma TVs and trendy clothing, hoping wealthier shoppers would spend more in its stores.\n\nBut lower-income customers balked at some of the changes, and Wal-Mart has returned to emphasizing its low prices.\n\nWal-Mart executives said the retailer is still working on tailoring merchandise in its stores to meet the needs of the local markets, instead of following its previous one-size-fits-all strategy.\n\nIt is also trying to improve customer service, \u201cespecially around checkout,\u201d Scott said.\n\nRichard Hastings, an analyst at credit rating agency Bernard Sands, said he was not surprised by Wal-Mart\u2019s decision to scale back growth, but added that a \u201cfundamental rebound\u201d at Wal-Mart stores was likely years away.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that even greater deterioration at the Wal-Mart Stores division could appear before things get better,\u201d Hastings wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWal-Mart said its overall consolidated square-footage growth rate would be about 6 percent for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and 4 to 5 percent in the United States.\n\nSchoewe said the new expansion strategy would lower Wal-Mart\u2019s fiscal 2008 capital spending to $15.5 billion from $17 billion.\n\nThe retailer also said it will repurchase $15 billion worth of its shares.\n\nWal-Mart shares rose $1.87, or 3.9 percent, to $49.47 in New York Stock Exchange trading. In the past 52 weeks, the shares have traded in a range of $52.15 to $42.31.\n\nSafeway rose $1.81 to $36.29, Kroger shares rose $1.09 to $31.41 and Supervalu Inc.\u2019s (SVU.N) stock gained $1.00, or 2.1 percent, to $48.64. Shares of Wal-Mart rival Target gained $1.24, or 2 percent, to $63.67."

Even so, a bout of profit-taking kept Friday\u2019s gains in check.\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019ve gotten more M&A news and private equity deals, putting big support under the market, but people are afraid to push it much higher,\u201d said Rich Parker, head of trading at the Stanford Group in New York.\n\nWal-Mart finished at $49.47, up 3.9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the biggest gainer in the blue-chip Dow average and ranked No. 2, behind Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N), among the top advancers in the broad S&P 500 index. Exxon Mobil\u2019s stock ended up 1.3 percent at $84.22 as oil prices headed higher. U.S. crude for July delivery CLN7 gained $1.07 to settle at $65.08 a barrel.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s move to scale back supercenter store openings boosted shares of its rivals, including grocers Kroger Co. (KR.N), which ended up 3.6 percent at $31.41, and Safeway Inc. SWY.N, which gained 5.3 percent to $36.29.\n\nOn Nasdaq, shares of Dell Inc. DELL.O rose 1.5 percent to $27.30 after the computer maker\u2019s quarterly profit beat estimates.\n\nBig manufacturers also featured among the standouts, with shares of chemical maker DuPont DD.N ending up 1.5 percent at $53.10 on the NYSE, and diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. (HON.N), finishing up 1.5 percent at $58.80.\n\nBut shares of Boeing slipped 0.8 percent to $99.83 in NYSE trading, while on the Nasdaq, shares of Apple dropped 2.3 percent to $118.40.\n\nBefore the opening bell, Wall Street got a strong reading on the economy when the government reported that employers added 157,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in May. That sharply exceeded Wall Street\u2019s forecasts. Later in the morning, a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed its index of national factory activity rose more than expected, as factory managers began replenishing depleted inventories in May. And consumers were optimistic, with the final May reading in a Reuters/University of Michigan survey showing consumer sentiment also above expectations.\n\nVolume was moderate on the NYSE, where about 1.48 billion shares changed hands, below last year\u2019s estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.92 billion shares were traded, below last year\u2019s daily average of 2.02 billion.\n\nAdvancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of about 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on the Nasdaq."

        "body": "FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas (Reuters) - The employee rally that doubles as the annual meeting for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) on Friday featured comedy from Sinbad, a performance by Jennifer Lopez and a flag-waving salute to the 13 countries where the company operates outside the United States.\n\nOh, and there was the public endorsement of Chief Executive Lee Scott by the chairman of the board, who acknowledged it has been a tough year for the retailer.\n\n\u201cThe board and our Walton family have absolute confidence in your leadership, Lee,\u201d said Rob Walton, chairman of the board of the world\u2019s largest retailer and son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton.\n\nThe vote of confidence comes at a time when the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer has seen its U.S. sales struggle amid what the company says were merchandising missteps such as offering trendy clothes its customers rejected.\n\nSales at its U.S. stores open at least a year fell 3.5 percent in April -- the largest drop since it began reporting the figures in 1979.\n\nThe company is also mired in a high-profile legal battle with former marketing communications chief Julie Roehm, who was fired in December after less than a year at the company.\n\nRoehm sued for breach of contract and Wal-Mart counter sued, with each side accusing the other of ethical violations.\n\nIn other negative news, the company in March fired an employee making what it said were unauthorized tape recordings of telephone calls to and from a New York Times reporter and also fired his supervisor.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an easy year this year, but believe me, it wasn\u2019t always easy for mother and dad, either,\u201d Walton said.\n\nThis year\u2019s annual meeting was markedly different than the 2006 production, which included a full-length scripted musical.\n\nInstead, Wal-Mart executives gave straight-forward presentations about the business, sprinkled with entertainment from Sinbad, Lopez and Jordin Sparks, the most recent winner of the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d television singing contest.\n\nThe meeting is attended by thousands of Wal-Mart employees from all over the world, chosen by their co-workers.\n\nSinbad drew huge applause when he referenced the meeting\u2019s early -- 7 a.m. -- start time.\n\n\u201cI have some thoughts for next year -- 11 o\u2019clock,\u201d he quipped.\n\nHe also noted Wal-Mart employees might be a bit over zealous when it comes to helping costumers in the stores.\n\n\u201cI was just there to buy toothbrushes,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty- five people took me to the dental aisle. Brushed my teeth. Helped me floss.\u201d\n\nBut investors viewing the meeting may have been more concerned about some help for the stock price, which has well underperformed the shares of rival Target Corp. (TGT.N) in the past year.\n\nA company announcement it planned to slow the pace of superstore openings in the United States and also that it had adopted a new $15 billion stock buyback plan appeared to help. Wal-Mart shares were up $1.90, or 4 percent, at $49.50 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Walton Arena is usually decorated with banners touting the numerous championships won by the University of Arkansas Razorbacks basketball team.\n\nBut on Friday, other banners were also on display -- with the mantra \u201csaving people money so they can live better.\u201d\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest retailer -- and largest company based on sales -- Wal-Mart is a lightning rod for unions and others who question its pay and benefits practices, blame it for forcing small stores out of business, and for helping speed the push of manufacturing from the United States to lower-cost countries.\n\nWal-Mart executives on Friday touted the company\u2019s green initiatives -- such as pushing for reductions in packaging materials -- its $4 prescription plan and its policy of choosing most of its managers and executives from the ranks of current employees.\n\n\u201cAttacks from our opponents are just not working and they are not going to work,\u201d Scott said."

        "body": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark., June 1 (Reuters) - British retailer Tesco Plc. (TSCO.L) should do well when it enters the U.S. market later this year, but it should not have a significant impact on Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\u2019s (WMT.N) sales in the near term, Wal-Mart\u2019s chief executive said on Friday.\n\n\u201cI would expect that we will learn things from them, what works and what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott said in a meeting with reporters after the company\u2019s annual meeting.\n\nTesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, plans to open Fresh & Easy Neighborhood market stores this year in California, Nevada and Arizona. Those stores will be smaller than traditional markets, focus on ready-to-eat meals and offer more fresh and environmentally friendly products than typical grocery and convenience stores.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can look at Tesco in the next five years and ask if there is going to be some significant impact on Wal-Mart sales,\u201d Scott said, noting the size of the stores Tesco plans to open. \u201cOver the long run, 20 years, 25 years, what does that mean? That\u2019s a different question.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe compete with them around the world, and we tend to not go out of business,\u201d Scott said.\n\nWal-Mart shares were up 3.9 percent on Friday at $49.46 after the retailer said it would cut back on the number of supercenters it opens and set a new $15 billion stock repurchase plan."
