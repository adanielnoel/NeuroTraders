        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twice in the past year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc has given its stock a shot in the arm by announcing plans to rein in expansion in the United States.\n\nInvestors are now watching to see if there will be a repeat performance at the retailer\u2019s annual analyst meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. Wal-Mart, whose shares have done very little this year, typically outlines its capital spending and store expansion plans there.\n\n\u201cNext week\u2019s analyst meeting could prove a positive near-term catalyst if management further reduces square footage growth or capex,\u201d Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira wrote in an research note.\n\nBut since Wal-Mart has cut its growth plans twice in the past year -- once at its last analyst meeting and again at its shareholders meeting in June -- it raises the question of how much more room there is for the world\u2019s largest retailer to pull back.\n\n\u201cI would be surprised if between June and now that they made a huge material change to what they told us, but they might,\u201d said MFC Global Investment Management analyst Sarah Henry.\n\nAnalysts have pushed Wal-Mart to pull back on U.S. expansion so it can concentrate on improving sales at its more than 3,400 namesake discount stores and supercenters, which combine grocery stores with the discount store format.\n\nIts shares rose nearly 4 percent last October when it said it would delay opening new stores that are close enough to existing locations to draw away customers, and planned to build smaller ones where possible to reduce costs.\n\nThe Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also said it expected retail space to grow by 7.5 percent in the fiscal year that started February 1 -- a modest slowdown from the 8 percent increases in recent years.\n\nThe shares jumped 4 percent again on June 1, when Wal-Mart said it would cut the number of supercenters it plans to open by as much as 30 percent this year. It also lowered its fiscal 2008 capital spending to $15.5 billion from $17 billion.\n\nChief Administrative Officer John Menzer said last month that the retailer\u2019s goal was to beat that $15.5 billion capital spending figure.\n\nBut the planned slowdown has yet to help U.S. sales.\n\nSales at U.S. stores open at least a year, or comparable-store sales, rose 2.1 percent last fiscal year -- the smallest gain since Wal-Mart began posting such figures in 1980.\n\nFor the first eight months of this fiscal year, U.S. comparable-store sales were up 1.5 percent, compared with a year-earlier gain of 2.6 percent.\n\nTo try to improve sales, Wal-Mart is emphasizing its low prices and revamping its merchandise, especially clothing. But this effort comes as its core lower-income shoppers are being squeezed by high food and fuel prices, and a slumping housing market.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has failed to make gains. Shares of Wal-Mart are down more than 11 percent since the company announced the slower growth plans at its last analyst meeting on October 23, 2006. They trade at 13.5 times next year\u2019s earnings.\n\nBy contract, rival Target Corp trades at 15.6 times next year\u2019s earnings, and its shares have gained nearly 4 percent.\n\nAnalysts said they wanted to hear what strategies Wal-Mart will pursue to ensure U.S. sales get back on track.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather them come out and be honest and say \u2018We think it\u2019s going to take a couple of years to fix it\u2019 instead of a couple of months because, in reality, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take,\u201d said JP Morgan analyst Charles Grom.\n\nHe said the stock would probably trade in a low- to mid-$40s range until there is a marked improvement in comparable-store sales.\n\nAnalysts also said they would like an update on the international business, where Wal-Mart has faced struggles ranging from Japan, where its Seiyu Ltd unit is headed for its sixth straight annual loss, to India, where it faces protests over its wholesale venture with Bharti Enterprises.\n\nAnalysts also want an update on how Wal-Mart may fare during the holidays after it vowed to aggressively cut prices to win sales. On Thursday, Wal-Mart cut prices on 15,000 more items.\n\n\u201cI think that strategy can be effective if you can get the customers to shop the rest of the store\u201d and buy higher-margin items, Henry said.\n\nBut she added: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to drive comps if you\u2019re continually taking down the price on everything.\u201d"

The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trade in the stock following the reports.\n\nSeparately, the Nikkei business daily said Seiyu will announce as early as Monday Wal-Mart\u2019s plan to make it a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer has invested more than $1 billion in Seiyu since 2002, but has yet to see anything more than temporary upswings in sales amid tough competition with rivals such as Aeon Co (8267.T).\n\nSeiyu is headed for its sixth straight annual loss in 2007, which has caused speculation that Wal-Mart could consider pulling out Japan, as it did from South Korea and Germany last year.\n\nCracking Japan\u2019s retail market, the world\u2019s second-largest, has proved a challenge for foreign companies, due in part to fickle shopping habits and tough competition.\n\nIn recent years France\u2019s Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Britian\u2019s Alliance Boots [AB.UL] have both been pulled out of the market."

The offer price marks a 61 percent premium to Friday\u2019s closing share price of 87 yen.\n\nTrade of Seiyu\u2019s shares was suspended by the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday, following reports of the buyout.\n\n\u201cIt really does give (Wal-Mart) the opportunity to do whatever they want to do with Seiyu,\u201d said Roy Larke, editor of Japan Consuming, an industry newsletter.\n\n\u201cThey still don\u2019t have a major share of the market but they do own the number three retailer in the country. They have a much solider base than they ever had in Korea and therefore something to build on,\u201d Larke said.\n\nFor the year to December 31 2007, the company has forecast a net loss of 10.4 billion yen.\n\nHowever, there may be signs of progress: same-store sales showed their first annual rise in 15 years in 2006, although they still fell short of the company\u2019s target.\n\nSeiyu\u2019s Kolodzieski said there were no plans to shut down any of the supermarket\u2019s nearly 400 outlets in Japan and that it was looking to accelerate its renovation of existing stores.\n\nLast month, Seiyu said it would offer early retirement to 450 of its employees, or about 7 percent of its work force. In 2004 the company eliminated about 1,600 jobs.\n\nCracking Japan\u2019s retail market, the world\u2019s second-largest, has proved a challenge for foreign companies, due to fickle shoppers and tough competition.\n\nIn recent years France\u2019s Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Britain\u2019s Alliance Boots AB.UL have both pulled out of the market.\n\nShares of Seiyu have lost three-quarters of their value since the end of 2002, the year when Wal-Mart first bought into the supermarket.\n\nDuring the same period, the Tokyo stock exchange index of retail stocks .IRETL.T has gained about 25 percent."
