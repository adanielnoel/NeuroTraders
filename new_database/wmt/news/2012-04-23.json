        "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The front-running candidate for Mexico\u2019s presidency and lawmakers on Monday called on authorities to investigate allegations of bribery at the Mexican unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, though prosecutors said it may not be a federal matter.\n\nOpposition lawmakers urged Mexico to launch a probe into the allegations, and Enrique Pena Nieto, the favorite to succeed conservative President Felipe Calderon, backed them up.\n\nMexico\u2019s attorney general would only look into the accusations against Wal-Mart de Mexico (Walmex) if asked to do so by the finance ministry or the economy ministry, a government official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nOfficials at the finance and economy ministries could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nStill, Attorney General Marisela Morales assured Mexicans on that her office would act promptly if given the case.\n\n\u201cIf it becomes a matter for us, of course we will act and we will request whatever necessary,\u201d she told El Universal daily.\n\nThe New York Times reported over the weekend that retailer Wal-Mart had silenced an internal investigation into hundreds of suspect payments worth more than $24 million made to expand its business in Mexico.\n\nA campaign spokesman for Pena Nieto, the candidate of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), said he wanted the allegations to be investigated.\n\nAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador, presidential candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said on Sunday that the allegations showed the government was \u201crotten,\u201d and he expressed dismay that the case was so far only being investigated outside Mexico.\n\nTwo opposition left-wing senators on the Senate\u2019s Banking and Public Credit Commission also demanded a probe.\n\n\u201cIf licenses were given out where they shouldn\u2019t have been, there\u2019s fraud not only in the cities where that happened, but also there could have been fiscal fraud,\u201d Francisco Javier Castellon of PRD was quoted as saying in Monday\u2019s edition of daily Rumbo de Mexico.\n\nWal-Mart said on Saturday that it had begun an investigation last fall into its compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It said it disclosed the probe to the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re aware that at this time there are questions we do not have answers for. We would like to be able to say more, but we are not prepared to risk the integrity of the investigation,\u201d said a further statement from Walmex on Monday, after its shares fell more than 11 percent.\n\nWhile political pressure for action may increase in Mexico ahead of presidential elections on July 1, corruption-weary Mexicans barely raised eyebrows when they read of the bribery allegations in local newspapers.\n\nBribery and corruption is pervasive in Mexico, where the justice system is weak and lower-level public sector workers earn relatively meager salaries. One study last year by Transparency International showed that Mexican companies were perceived to be the third most likely behind those in China and Russia to pay bribes abroad.\n\nStill, the country has been taking steps to turn around this image and an anti-corruption law was recently passed by Mexico\u2019s lower house that would give the country new powers to fine companies for corruption.\n\n\u201cIt is important for Mexico to show it is tough on corruption,\u201d said lawyer Salvador Mejia, partner at Torres, Martinez y Mejia in Mexico City. \u201cI can definitely see Walmex being investigated further here.\u201d\n\nWalmex is due to report first-quarter financial results after the market closes on Monday."

Adding to the uncertainty was a Sunday vote in France that threw the presidential race wide open.\n\nThe renewed worries came as the euro zone\u2019s business slump deepened at a far faster pace than expected in April.\n\nEurope\u2019s debt crisis has been a major headwind for U.S. equities as investors worried it may hurt corporate profits. Bank shares were hit by the concern, including Morgan Stanley , which fell 3.1 percent to $16.93.\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc slumped 4.9 percent to $59.41 and was the biggest drag on the Dow after the New York Times reported Wal-Mart officials stymied an internal investigation into bribery allegations at its Mexican unit, Walmart de Mexico . Those shares were last down 11.6 percent to 38.05 pesos in Mexico.\n\nThe sell-off was broad with about six stocks on the New York Stock Exchange falling for each one that rose, and the economically sensitive S&P materials sector was the among the worst performing areas, down 1.9 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a period now where the market seems to be consolidating gains from the first and fourth quarter, and we\u2019re going back and forth,\u201d said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear the euro zone is in a recession, and that brings a lot of concerns.

        "body": "By Rob Cox The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nS. Robson Walton, Wal-Mart\u2019s multi-billionaire chairman, is about to prove money can\u2019t buy happiness. He\u2019ll need to channel his father\u2019s spirit of integrity and initiate an independent probe into how top executives, possibly the chief and another director, participated in an alleged cover-up of widespread bribery and corruption at the company\u2019s successful Mexican subsidiary. It won\u2019t be fun for the son of Wal-Mart\u2019s founder. But the $213 billion company can recover by doing the right thing.\n\nThe alleged infractions revealed in an in-depth New York Times investigative report over the weekend are less worrisome than the way the mega-retailer appeared to handle them. Through 2005, the newspaper reported, millions of dollars of bribes were paid by Wal-Mart to fixers, who then sprinkled them around to local officials to remove impediments to Wal-Mart\u2019s growth in the country. Illegal though this may be for a U.S. corporation, it\u2019s not uncommon in Mexico and other parts of the developing world.\n\nThe trouble is that top brass at Wal-Mart\u2019s Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters had been made aware of the shenanigans and willfully sought to sweep them under the carpet, according to the Times. Among the executives were two current directors, then-CEO H. Lee Scott and his successor Michael Duke, who ran international operations at the time. Current Wal-Mart vice chairman, Eduardo Castro-Wright, ran the Mexican unit.\n\nRather than root out the problem, Bentonville asked the general counsel of the Mexican business, who allegedly approved the bribes, to investigate, the Times reports. Not surprisingly, the scandal disappeared. Now that it\u2019s public, any attempt to whitewash the charges risks sinking Wal-Mart further into the mire. U.S. authorities are investigating possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Times reports.\n\nWalton and his board have only one good option: to get to the bottom of what happened and come clean. The company notes that many of the alleged activities are six years old and do not reflect \u201cwho we are and what we stand for\u201d. That may be true. But if Duke and Scott ignored the law, they must go. As Sam Walton once said, \u201chigh expectations are the key to everything.\u201d That\u2019s as true in merchandising as it is in ethics."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The follow-up to the New York Times\u2019 blockbuster scoop on Wal-Mart\u2019s alleged cover-up of $24 million in Mexican bribes has, quite rightly, focused on the company\u2019s potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act exposure. But that\u2019s not the only law Wal-Mart and its executives should be worrying about.\n\nGood old Sarbanes-Oxley, passed in 2002 in the wake of accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, and other public companies, was intended to prevent exactly the kind of coverup Wal-Mart allegedly engaged in, according to the Times report. The 10-year-old law imposed gatekeeper duties on corporate lawyers, who are supposed to report material violations of the securities laws up the chain of command, all the way to the audit committee of the board, if necessary. SOX also requires corporations and their auditors to report on the company\u2019s internal controls for financial reporting -- and requires that CEOs and CFOs certify the material accuracy of financial reports. According to securities-law experts, if the Times\u2019 allegations are true, Wal-Mart may have run afoul of all of these provisions.\n\nThe bribery allegations originated with a Wal-Mart lawyer in Mexico, who told Wal-Mart International\u2019s general counsel, Maritza Munich, about the \u201cirregularities.\u201d She authorized a preliminary investigation by outside counsel in Mexico, then -- quite appropriately -- reported the findings to Wal-Mart\u2019s then-general counsel, Thomas Mars, among other senior officials. Mars brought in Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which proposed that it conduct a far-reaching internal investigation. So far, so good.\n\nBut instead of hiring Willkie, Mars allegedly sent the Mexico bribery probe back down the ladder to the company\u2019s internal investigations unit. According to the Times, investigators turned up unsettling evidence implicating both a fast-rising Wal-Mart de Mexico executive and Wal-Mart de Mexico\u2019s general counsel in the bribery and accounting cover-up. In a preliminary draft report in December 2005, the lead in-house investigator wrote, \u201cThere is reasonable suspicion to believe that Mexican and USA laws have been violated.\u201d\n\nForeign bribery wasn\u2019t the cause celebre in 2005 that it has become today, but according to the Times, the company\u2019s vice-chairman was already concerned about the \u201cunacceptable risk the government\u2019s stepped-up enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\u201d So after receiving a preliminary report suggesting the company had broken the law, did Wal-Mart disclose the findings to its own audit committee and to its shareholders?\n\nIt did not. According to the Times, the then-CEO, Lee Scott, called a meeting in February 2006 to decide what to do. GC Mars was among the tight group of senior executives who decided to transfer the bribery investigation to the very same Wal-Mart de Mexico general counsel who had been implicated in the preliminary inquiry. The Mexican GC proceeded to wrap up the investigation in a few weeks, finding no clear evidence of bribery or law-breaking, the Times reported.\n\nThere are different SOX implications in those (alleged) facts for Wal-Mart\u2019s former top lawyer and its former CEO. The law\u2019s gatekeeper provisions for lawyers were very controversial as the Securities and Exchange Commission drafted its enforcement rule in 2003. Corporate lawyers were concerned that senior execs wouldn\u2019t consult them on serious issues, for fear the lawyers would run to the board. In fact, the SEC has not taken action against any lawyer for failing to report up the chain, according to Columbia Law School professor John Coffee and SEC Actions blogger Thomas Gorman of Dorsey & Whitney. (An SEC spokesman confirmed that there\u2019s been no formal enforcement of the gatekeeper rule.)\n\n\u201cThe SEC walked away from the rules,\u201d said Coffee. It\u2019s easy to see why. SOX requires the corporate attorney to take reasonable steps, which means the agency would have to probe the lawyer\u2019s state of mind. There are also attorney-client privilege problems. Gatekeeper cases are apparently a problem the SEC has decided it doesn\u2019t need, and the folks I talked to agreed it\u2019s unlikely Mars will be targeted.\n\nBut Coffee, Gorman, and UCLA Law School professor Stephen Bainbridge -- who was the first to suggest that Wal-Mart might have a SOX problem link.reuters.com/pyr77s -- all said that the CEO and CFO certifications and internal controls responsibility could tempt the government. The Justice Department has so far brought only one criminal SOX false certification case, against former Healthsouth CEO Richard Scrushy, who was acquitted on the charge. (The SEC has brought \"dozens\" of false certification enforcement actions, according to a spokesman.)\n\nBainbridge said, however, that prosecutors have been handed the Wal-Mart case \u201con a silver platter by the New York Times,\u201d and may feel obliged to make an example of the executives who signed off on the company\u2019s filings. \u201cAt a bare minimum, there are disclosure problems,\u201d Bainbridge said.\n\n\u201cThis could well be the first certification case\u201d in connection with unreported FCPA exposure, added Gorman of Dorsey & Whitney. \u201cSarbanes-Oxley puts a lot of pressure on companies to do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat surprising to see these allegations about a major company.\u201d\n\nFalsely certifying financial results is no small matter for corporate executives. The criminal statute calls for maximum penalties of $1 million and 10 years imprisonment for a false certification and $5 million and 20 years for a willfully false filing.\n\nBainbridge pointed out that Wal-Mart\u2019s first line of defense to SOX allegations will be to argue that the alleged Mexican bribery was not material so it didn\u2019t have to be disclosed. Back in 2005 and 2006, as the company was investigating the allegations, there was no Justice Department or SEC case to report to shareholders, and the company\u2019s final report concluded there was no bribery. \u201cYou could imagine people saying, \u2018We don\u2019t have to disclose,'\u201d said Bainbridge. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a certification case unless you have an underlying disclosure case.\u201d (He believes it would be simpler for the SEC to assert a controls case against the corporation.)\n\nCoffee, however, said Wal-Mart\u2019s leaders should be worried. \u201cSenior people were hearing things went bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they knew, but it\u2019s very likely they knew enough to be concerned about the certifications.\u201d\n\nA Wal-Mart spokesman declined to respond to emailed questions about the company\u2019s potential SOX violations."

        "body": "CHICAGO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc lost $10 billion of its market value on Monday on concerns that a bribery investigation in Mexico could be very costly and hinder its plans to grow.\n\nIn a sign that the problem was widening for the world\u2019s largest retailer, two U.S. lawmakers said they were launching their own investigation into allegations in a New York Times article that Wal-Mart de Mexico had engaged in a multi-year campaign of bribery to build its business. In Mexico, the front-running presidential candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto, and lawmakers also called on local authorities to investigate.\n\nIf the allegations are true, Wal-Mart may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which forbids bribes to foreign government officials, as well as run afoul of Sarbanes-Oxley rules that require corporate gatekeepers to report material violations of securities laws.\n\nLegal and retail experts also raised concerns about Wal-Mart Chief Executive Mike Duke and former CEO Lee Scott, who were among senior executives allegedly aware of the situation, according to the Times. Scott still sits on the company\u2019s board.\n\nTwo Democratic U.S. lawmakers, Elijah Cummings and Henry Waxman, said they were launching an investigation into the matter and sent a letter to Duke requesting a meeting.\n\nThe Times report \u201craises significant questions about the actions of top company officials in the United States who reportedly tried to disregard substantial evidence of abuse,\u201d Cummings and Waxman said in a statement.\n\nShares of Wal-Mart de Mexico, which is 69 percent-owned by Wal-Mart and known as Walmex, fell 12 percent to 37.89 pesos ($2.88). The drop wiped out a 12 percent year-to-date gain in the second-most-weighted stock on Mexico\u2019s IPC index.\n\nShares of Wal-Mart fell 4.7 percent to $59.54, wiping some $10 billion off their market value and more than erasing this year\u2019s gains. The stock is a component of the Dow Jones industrials index, which ended 0.8 percent lower.\n\nThe news raised concerns that Wal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, may have trouble expanding into new markets.\n\n\u201cEntering additional countries is a cornerstone of Wal-Mart\u2019s growth strategy,\u201d Consumer Edge Research analyst Faye Landes wrote in a research note. \u201cWe can foresee the authorities in some key countries, notably India, becoming dramatically less welcoming to Wal-Mart following the release of the allegations.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported on Saturday that a senior Wal-Mart lawyer received an email from a former Walmex executive in September 2005 that described how the Mexican company had paid bribes to obtain permits to build stores in the country.\n\nAccording to the Times, Wal-Mart sent investigators to Mexico City and found a paper trail of suspect payments totaling more than $24 million. But the company\u2019s leaders shut down the probe and did not notify U.S. or Mexican law enforcement officials until after the newspaper informed Wal-Mart that it was looking into the issue, the Times reported.\n\nWal-Mart said it was deeply concerned about the matter and began an investigation into its FCPA compliance last fall. It said it disclosed the probe to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and declined to give any more details or to make executives available for comment.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said the Justice Department has been conducting a criminal investigation into the bribery matter for months.\n\nIn a memo entitled \u201cIntegrity\u201d sent to Wal-Mart employees on Monday, Duke said the company takes compliance with FCPA \u201cvery seriously, and we will not tolerate violations anywhere or at any level of the company.\u201d The memo included a link to Wal-Mart\u2019s global ethics office website and phone hotline.\n\n\u201cMy firm expectation is that Wal-Mart will always follow the law, but my expectation also goes far beyond following the law. We will do what\u2019s right - not just what is legal - and our actions will show the utmost integrity at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, the favorite candidate to succeed conservative President Felipe Calderon, joined some opposition lawmakers in calling for the government to launch an investigation. Mexico\u2019s attorney general Marisela Morales said her office would act promptly if asked to do so by the Ministry of Finance or Ministry of the Economy.\n\n\u201cIf licenses were given out where they shouldn\u2019t have been, there\u2019s fraud not only in the cities where that happened, but also there could have been fiscal fraud,\u201d Francisco Javier Castellon of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) was quoted as saying in the newspaper Rumbo de Mexico.\n\nBribery and corruption are pervasive in Mexico, where the justice system is weak and lower-level public sector workers earn relatively low salaries. A study last year by Transparency International showed that Mexican companies were perceived to be the third-most likely behind those in China and Russia to pay bribes abroad.\n\nStill, the country has been taking steps to turn around this image and an anti-corruption law was recently passed by Mexico\u2019s lower house that would give the country new powers to fine companies for corruption.\n\nBMO Capital Markets analyst Wayne Hood said in a research note that Wal-Mart\u2019s growth could be hurt both domestically and abroad by the bribery allegations. \u201cArticles like this will be used against the company by activists and competitors when it attempts to open stores in the U.S. and abroad,\u201d Hood wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nOthers said the share drop could actually provide a buying opportunity, given that Wal-Mart shares had been trading near a 52-week high on optimism over the recovery in its U.S. business. Options market activity also suggested a bullish bias on Wal-Mart stock.\n\nCitigroup analysts said in a note that, after discussions with Wal-Mart, it believed that the retailer would conduct a \u201cthorough and transparent\u201d review and said any pressure on the stock was \u201can enhanced buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS), which holds over 5.5 million shares of Wal-Mart Stores, will keep its exposure to the retail giant until it finds out what happened, CalSTRS\u2019s director of corporate governance, Anne Sheehan, told Reuters.\n\nSome hedge fund managers said Walmex was the more attractive target for short sellers.\n\nWalmex said on Monday that it does not believe the allegations will hurt its business.\n\nAfter the market close, Walmex\u2019s first-quarter earnings missed analysts\u2019 expectations. Executives on a pre-recorded call did not mention the bribery probe.\n\n\u201cThis investigation shocked investors,\u201d said Gerardo Roman, head of trading at Mexico City brokerage Actinver. \u201cWalmex had been considered an extremely ethical company. It was a safe haven for investors,\u201d he added, noting that the stock reached historic highs two weeks ago.\n\nLawyers said Wal-Mart could face shareholder lawsuits accusing the company of securities fraud for having inflated its stock price by misleading investors about its FCPA compliance. Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc faces similar lawsuits over its activities in China.\n\nWal-Mart executives and directors, like their Avon counterparts, could face \u201cderivative\u201d lawsuits accusing them of covering up or turning a blind eye to the alleged bribes.\n\nThese lawsuits seek to force executives, or their insurers, to pay money directly to Wal-Mart for breaching or ignoring their duties, and for the company to tighten internal controls.\n\nShareholders could also use the power of the ballot box. At Wal-Mart\u2019s June 1 annual meeting, they could vote out directors they deem responsible for allowing the bribery, including the four independent directors who comprise the audit committee.\n\nNearly 50 percent of Wal-Mart\u2019s shares are owned by the family of deceased founder Sam Walton, which may mute the power of other shareholders."

        "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Whether you are the world\u2019s No. 1 retailer or a humble street vendor, paying public officials a bribe may be the quickest way to get your business growing in Mexico.\n\nThe New York Times reported this weekend that Wal-Mart Stores Inc investigators probing its Mexican operations found a paper trail of hundreds of suspect payments worth more than $24 million made to grow its business there, and that the company then quashed the investigation.\n\nWal-Mart said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the allegations, which have lifted the lid on a culture of corruption in Mexico that many of its residents take for granted.\n\nOne global study said Mexican firms were perceived to be the third most likely behind those in China and Russia to pay bribes abroad.\n\nWhen 40-year-old market stall owner Adrian Martinez decided to open a second spot to sell his wares in Mexico City, he said he figured it was better to pay a bribe to a \u201cgestor\u201d, or intermediary, to get a permit than wait for authorities to process his request.\n\nMartinez paid the equivalent of several hundred dollars for the permit, a fraction of the sum the New York Times said Wal-Mart de Mexico - the country\u2019s top retailer - had given to middlemen to help it get permits to build and open new stores.\n\n\u201cI greased his palm,\u201d said Martinez, who said he earns about 400 pesos ($30) a day selling clothes and cosmetics. \u201cLots of others do the same here. If you want to do things by the book, you\u2019ll be waiting a long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Wal-Mart came to the same conclusion as it rapidly expanded its business from an initial joint venture in 1991 to becoming Mexico\u2019s top retailer and biggest private employer, with a network of more than 2,000 stores and restaurants.\n\n\u201cThis is really no surprise to Mexicans,\u201d said John Ackerman, a legal expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise that it\u2019s so well documented, but it\u2019s no surprise to read this story about Wal-Mart.\u201d\n\nPaying bribes has a long tradition in Mexico dating back to the colonial era, and Wal-Mart is not the first company to come under scrutiny for allegations of illicit payments.\n\nIn May 2011, a U.S. court handed down guilty verdicts against executives at a California company who were behind a cash-for-contracts scheme involving Mexico\u2019s Federal Electricity Commission, a utility known as CFE.\n\nThe temptation to skirt red tape in Mexico has been encouraged over time by a weak justice system and the relatively low salaries of many lower-level public sector workers.\n\nMexican police often earn well below $1,000 a month.\n\nMexico\u2019s biggest daily newspapers gave scant coverage on Sunday to the Wal-Mart story, with most relegating it to their back business sections. Only one newspaper, Reforma, put the story on its front page, but even then it only summarized the article\u2019s allegations and gave the company\u2019s response.\n\nHowever, leftist presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has long railed against corruption in Mexico and almost won the last election in 2006, said the reports provided fresh evidence of the \u201crotten\u201d state of government in Mexico.\n\nIt was particularly illuminating that the investigation about Wal-Mart had been launched abroad, and \u201cnot from Mexico\u201d, said Lopez Obrador, who accused President Felipe Calderon of rigging the vote to defeat him in the 2006 election.\n\nRecent polls suggest Lopez Obrador may be moving into second place in this year\u2019s race, behind favorite Enrique Pena Nieto of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Mexico\u2019s longstanding rulers whose name became a byword for corruption.\n\nJavier Oliva, a political scientist at UNAM, said payment of corporate bribes began to increase after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force in Mexico in 1994.\n\n\u201cForeign companies in the main started to look for ways of speeding up official procedures,\u201d Oliva said. \u201cRegrettably, this is how it works in much of Mexico.\u201d\n\nAnd Mexicans are used to it.\n\nA study by anti-corruption watchdog Transparencia Mexicana, the local arm of Transparency International (TI), showed Mexicans in 2010 paid a bribe to deal with more than one in 10 items of official paperwork or access to public services.\n\nIllicit payments cover everything from connecting a telephone line to obtaining a driver\u2019s license and average around 165 pesos, Transparencia Mexicana said.\n\nThat figure leaps when big corporations try to operate in Mexico\u2019s capital and 31 different states, each of which has its own set of rules on how to set up a business or lease property, the watchdog\u2019s director Eduardo Bohorquez said recently.\n\nOn top of this come payments made by victims of extortion attempts to criminals, which TI said accounted for nearly one in four of bribe demands made in Mexico between 2007 and 2010.\n\nA 2011 TI study of 28 major economies gauging perceptions of how likely companies were to pay bribes abroad put Mexican firms third behind those in China and Russia.\n\nAll told, corruption costs Mexico around 1.5 trillion pesos ($114 billion) annually, or about 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), according to an estimate this week from the Private Sector Center for Economic Studies think tank.\n\nTo small businessmen like stall holder Martinez, who said he had saved himself up to a year\u2019s wait by paying a bribe, the system is able to flourish because it stems from above.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all come down from the politicians,\u201d he said.\n\nCorruption allegations have helped bring down figures right at the top of the political establishment in Mexico.\n\nRaul Salinas, brother of former President Carlos Salinas, the architect of NAFTA in Mexico, served 10 years in prison on corruption and murder charges until 2005.

They could lead to a time-consuming global probe, substantial financial penalties paid to U.S. authorities, and the departure of some executives.\n\nOne option Wal-Mart will have is to remove some of those involved in the alleged bribery or cover-up as this could make it easier to reach an out-of-court settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice concerning possible breaches of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), a U.S. law that forbids the payment of bribes to foreign government officials.\n\n\u201cAmong the remedial actions is \u2018house cleaning\u2019 of anyone involved in illegal conduct,\u201d said Richard Cassin, a lawyer who is an expert on the FCPA and writes a blog about it. \u201cIf a company can say those involved in the questionable conduct are already gone, the DOJ is likely to look more favorably on the company and current management.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart said it had disclosed its probe to the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said it had taken steps at the Mexico unit, which is widely known as Walmex, to boost internal controls to make sure it was FCPA compliant.\n\nBut, according to the Times, the disclosure came only after it informed Wal-Mart that it was looking into the bribery allegations, years after the bribes were said to first come to management\u2019s attention.\n\nA spokesman at the SEC said on Saturday he did not have any comment on the Times article. A DOJ spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n\u201cBecause of Wal-Mart\u2019s inaction for a very long time, it\u2019s likely its exposure is only going to increase,\u201d said Michael Koehler, a professor at Butler University and an expert on the FCPA.\n\nAccording to the Times, current Wal-Mart Chief Executive Mike Duke and former CEO Lee Scott, who still sits on the company\u2019s board, were among senior executives allegedly aware of the situation. Duke was put in charge of Wal-Mart\u2019s international division in 2005.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that the whistleblower Cicero had identified former Walmex CEO Eduardo Castro-Wright as the driving force behind years of bribery.\n\nCastro-Wright became CEO of Walmex in 2003 and was named CEO of Walmart US in 2005 and became a vice chairman in 2008. He led Wal-Mart\u2019s e-commerce business from 2010 until January this year, and is set to retire on July 1 after the company said last September that he was going to leave to spend more time with his family. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nWal-Mart said in a statement on Saturday it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the allegations in the Times report. It said it began an investigation into its compliance with anti-bribery laws last autumn. The company declined to make Duke or any other executives available for comment, and said the investigation was continuing.\n\nOn Sunday, Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said Duke had instructed the company to conduct a worldwide FCPA compliance review in March 2011.\n\n\u201cMike is fully supportive of the independent investigation being conducted in Mexico with oversight by the Audit Committee, including ensuring that all resources necessary are available to pursue the independent investigation aggressively,\u201d Tovar said.\n\nOn Friday, Walmex announced that one executive named the next day in the Times report, its general counsel and secretary to the board Jose Luis Rodriguezmacedo, had been assigned to other duties. He was removed from his role \u201cin the interest of the investigation,\u201d Walmex spokesman Antonio Ocaranza said in an email, adding that he could not give further details about Rodriguezmacedo\u2019s status at Walmex. Calls to Rodriguezmacedo were referred to the spokesman.\n\nExperts in bribery laws said Wal-Mart will be forced to devote millions of dollars and enormous amounts of manpower to its internal investigation. In many FCPA cases involving large companies, they do a large part of the investigation themselves and then hand the results over to the authorities.\n\n\u201cThis is very likely to last two to four years for Walmart. These worldwide investigations tend to take two to four years in the normal course of business; it simply takes time,\u201d said Koehler.\n\nCassin said Wal-Mart faces an uphill battle to convince U.S. regulators that its problems are confined to Mexico. The U.S. retailer also has major operations in the UK, Brazil, Japan, China and Canada, and it is also seeking to expand rapidly in emerging markets such as India and parts of Africa.\n\n\u201cBefore any resolution with U.S. authorities is possible, the company has to look under every stone for possible corruption. Are there any similar issues in China or other countries? That\u2019s what U.S. authorities will want to know. Wal-Mart\u2019s shareholders will be asking the same question,\u201d said Cassin.\n\nThe allegations could prove a huge problem for Wal-Mart if proven true, said Deutsche Bank retail analyst Charles Grom. \u201cIt would put a broadside in the growth engine of the company,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike prior bad PR stories in recent years, this will be a material distraction for Wal-Mart on multiple fronts.\u201d\n\nSome retail experts said they thought that Wal-Mart would be unlikely to sacrifice Duke in the investigation and any related talks over a settlement with the government.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get the sense that Mike Duke\u2019s going to lose his job over this,\u201d said Joseph Feldman, senior retail analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. \u201cI think that they\u2019ll try to put the spin on it that they have been putting on it - that it happened years ago, they rooted it out and it doesn\u2019t happen anymore.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s corporate structure may also reduce the chances of outside pressure from shareholder activists and others leading to drastic changes in the executive suite. The family of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton owns nearly 50 percent of the shares and Walton\u2019s eldest son, S. Robson (Rob) Walton, is chairman, and his younger brother Jim is also on the board.\n\nAccording to the Times, Rob Walton, Duke and Scott also had received an anonymous email in January 2006 saying Wal-Mart de Mexico\u2019s top real estate executives were receiving kickbacks from construction companies.\n\nWal-Mart, which employs 2.2 million people and runs more than 10,000 stores around the world, is often targeted by labor and community activists who argue that it underpays its workers and its sprawling stores undercut smaller shops, often putting them out of business. It has fought hard to improve its image in recent years with a number of campaigns, including one to make its operations more environmentally friendly.\n\nWal-Mart executives have, though, been active in a lobbying group that is pushing to scale back the FCPA. A 2010 tax return for the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform lists Jeff Gearhart, Wal-Mart\u2019s general counsel since 2009, and Thomas Hyde, who retired in August 2010 as Wal-Mart corporate secretary, as two of 40 people who served as board members.\n\nThe board includes top lawyers and executives from other major corporations. Dow Chemical Co, Exxon Mobil Corp and State Farm Insurance each had two people among the 40 listed board members during 2010.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform is associated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying organization in Washington, D.C. It wants lawmakers to make several changes to the corruption law, for example by adding a provision that would protect a corporation from liability if one of its employees circumvented compliance measures."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Hedge fund managers are bracing for selling pressure in shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Monday, but market experts said it is the retail giant\u2019s less visible Mexican unit that could be the more attractive target for short sellers.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Saturday that Wal-Mart de Mexico, which is 69 percent owned by Wal-Mart Stories Inc, had orchestrated a widespread bribery campaign in 2005 to win market dominance. The investigative article alleged that senior Wal-Mart executives knew about the matter and tried to cover it up.\n\n\u201cI would not consider Wal-Mart shares expensive, but I definitely would not be a buyer at these levels in the 60s. I\u2018m more interested in shorting the Mexico traded \u2018pure play,'\u201d said private activist investor Daniel Yu, who has presciently shorted such stocks including Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc and Sino-Forest Sino-Forest Corp.\n\nWal-Mart said in a statement on Saturday that it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the allegations in the Times report and began an investigation into its compliance with anti-bribery laws last autumn.\n\nAnalysts said Wal-Mart could be forced to devote millions of dollars and enormous amounts of manpower to the investigation, which could eventually cost some top executives their jobs.\n\nMajor institutional investors said Wal-Mart shares might face selling pressure in the near term, especially since the stock has risen about 17 percent in the past 12 months to $62.45, outperforming the S&P 500 index\u2019s 3 percent rise.\n\n\u201cYou might find a little short-term pressure on the Wal-Mart stock, but I would not expect any long-term effect,\u201d said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York.\n\nShort interest on the stock is very low. According to Data Explorers, which tracks short interest, just 0.5 percent of all shares are being borrowed for short sales, a very low figure.\n\nJohn Marshall, a senior markets analyst for the United Food and Commercial Workers capital stewardship program, wonders if there will be lawsuits being brought on behalf of shareholders.\n\nHe said shareholders are going to want to know if the board was actively managing risk. \u201cEither they were actively doing their job and fulfilling their responsibility to be managing that risk and they were lied to and the facts were being kept from them -- or they weren\u2018t. And that would be a bigger problem ... This is clearly an area of risk that the board should have been on top of.\u201d\n\nMarshall is not a Wal-Mart shareholder, but UFCW funds own Wal-Mart shares through broad equity indexes that they participate in on behalf of more than 1 million members.\n\nWal-Mart de Mexico, better known as Walmex, closed on Friday at 43.06 pesos, after gaining steadily since August of last year when they were just under 30 pesos.\n\nWalmex is due to report results on Monday. Mexico\u2019s largest retailer is expected to report a 14.1 percent increase in first-quarter profit, helped by a broad pickup in consumer spending as well as aggressive promotions that boosted sales.\n\nWalmex has expanded rapidly since Wal-Mart opened its first store outside the United States in Mexico City in 1991, then part of a joint venture. In 2011, the Mexican unit reported total sales of 379 billion pesos ($29 billion). Walmart\u2019s fiscal 2012 sales, for the year ended January 31, were $443.85 billion."

It said it had disclosed the probe to the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re aware that at this time there are questions we do not have answers for. We would like to be able to say more, but we are not prepared to risk the integrity of the investigation,\u201d Walmex said in a statement on Monday.\n\nWhile political pressure for action may increase in Mexico ahead of the presidential elections on July 1, corruption-weary Mexicans barely raised eyebrows when they read of the bribery allegations in local newspapers.\n\nBribery and corruption are pervasive in Mexico, where the justice system is weak and lower-level public sector workers earn relatively meager salaries. One study last year by Transparency International showed that Mexican companies were perceived to be the third most likely behind those in China and Russia to pay bribes abroad.\n\nMexico has been taking steps to turn around this image, and an anti-corruption law was recently passed by the lower house that would give the country new powers to fine companies for corruption.\n\n\u201cIt is important for Mexico to show it is tough on corruption,\u201d said lawyer Salvador Mejia, partner at Torres, Martinez y Mejia in Mexico City. \u201cI can definitely see Walmex being investigated further here.\u201d"
