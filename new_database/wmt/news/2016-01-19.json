        "body": "LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of U.S. retailer Wal-Mart, is preparing to announce job cuts as it grapples with changing shopping habits and a brutal industry price war.\n\nSky News reported on Monday that Asda would cut \u201chundreds of jobs\u201d, largely focused at its head office in Leeds, northern England.\n\nAsda responded by confirming it was in discussions with head office staff.\n\n\u201cToday, we have started to talk to our colleagues in head office functions about what this means for them. We have made some difficult but necessary decisions but we must discuss these with our colleagues before we talk publicly,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nAsda, in common with its big four rivals - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons - has been cutting prices in an attempt to stem the loss of customers to discounters Aldi and Lidl.\n\nLast week, Asda said it would spend a further 500 million pounds lowering prices.\n\nIndustry data published last week showed Asda was the worst performer of the big four supermarket chains over the Christmas period, with its sales falling 3.5 percent year-on-year over the 12 weeks to Jan. 3 and its market share dipping 0.6 percentage points to 16.2 percent.\n\nAsda has been the sector laggard on a sales basis for a year, with management choosing to protect profit margins rather than chase sales.
