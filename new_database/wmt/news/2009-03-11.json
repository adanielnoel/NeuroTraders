        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Inc, which has moved into low-cost healthcare with walk-in clinics and cheap prescriptions, said on Wednesday its Sam\u2019s Club unit would sell a package including software and Dell computers directly to doctors for electronic medical records.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to help the small practice doctor have access to medical records and practice management software re as well as the hardware at an affordable cost,\u201d Sam\u2019s Club spokeswoman Susan Koehler said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe discount retail giant said it would offer a package deal with hardware, software and installation for electronic medical records and e-prescribing.\n\n\u201cWe will be a single point of contact to help with training, installation, maintenance,\u201d Koehler said.\n\nKoehler said Sam\u2019s Club already was marketing small business services to healthcare professionals, with its pharmacies and opticians, as well as office supplies and other merchandise.\n\n\u201cThis will be an extension service of what we do already,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have more than 200,000 medical practices that we are already serving.\u201d\n\nMedical software company eClinicalworks will offer the software program, Koehler said. She said the package would cost the first doctor in a practice about $25,000, with each additional user costing around $10,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not live yet. We are optimistic we are going to be able to launch shortly, I guess early spring,\u201d Koehler said.\n\nWal-Mart also has walk-in medical clinics called \u201cThe Clinic at Wal-Mart\u201d and aims to open 2,000 nationwide in five to seven years.\n\n\u201cIt is partially how we got that idea\u201d for offering electronic health packages, Koehler said.\n\nIBM also offers electronic medical record software, an idea being pushed strongly by the administration of President Barack Obama as a way to cut healthcare costs, increase efficiency and reduce errors.\n\nWal-Mart also offers more than 1,000 over-the-counter items for $4 or less, a move that forced retailers from Target Corp to grocery stores and stand-alone pharmacies to offer similar discounts."
