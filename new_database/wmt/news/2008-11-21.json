        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc previewed some of the deep discounts it plans to offer right after Thanksgiving next week, part of a promotional strategy that has kept cash-strapped customers scouring its stores for bargains.\n\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving that traditionally marks the start of the holiday shopping season, is a time for retailers to tout their deals and try to capture shoppers\u2019 attention. The three-day holiday weekend can account for roughly 10 percent of total holiday sales.\n\nWal-Mart plans to advertise its Black Friday promotions on its website on Monday. But some of the deals appeared Friday on the shopping site www.black-friday.net.\n\nThey include a limited number of Nintendo\u2019s popular Wii video console for $249.24 on Friday and Saturday. The gaming system currently sells for $289.99 at rival Target Corp.\n\nA KitchenAid 4.5 quarter mixer sells for $130, $100 less than advertised at Macy\u2018s.\n\nU.S. Sales this holiday season are expected to be the worst in years, as the worsening economic climate forces many shoppers to cut out all but the most necessary of purchases.\n\nRetailers have been cutting prices to entice people to spend and to move inventory, but promotions have cut into profit margins at many chains.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s focus on low prices has been a winning strategy in recent months, helping it to increase sales and win market share. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart posted a 10 percent rise in quarterly profit, in stark contrast to competitors.\n\nAlso on Friday, the company announced that its chief executive, Lee Scott, would retire in February.\n\nIn a memo to employees, Chairman Rob Walton wrote \u201cour customers are relying on us more than ever in the current economic environment and we are well-positioned to serve them now and in the future.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart had a jump-start on the holiday season this year, advertising that it would begin promoting deep discounts on items like toys in October.\n\nThe retailer also plans to have special sales on its website on Thanksgiving Day."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Friday that Lee Scott will step down after nine years as chief executive and be replaced by Mike Duke, head of the company\u2019s international operations.\n\nScott will remain as chairman of the executive committee of the board and will continue to be employed until 2011.\n\nThe following are market reactions on the change at the top of the largest retailer.\n\nJOSEPH FELDMAN, RETAIL ANALYST WITH TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP IN NEW YORK\n\n\u201dI think it\u2019s good. I\u2018m happy to see it. My guess would be that they\u2019re setting up Eduardo to be the next CEO, given that they made him vice chairman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little strange that (Scott) didn\u2019t want to get through the holiday season, so I want to ask the company about that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re going to have a lousy season.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis is a huge shock, particularly given this is Lee Scott\u2019s most successful year. The stock has been the superstar of the Dow this year, but Wal-Mart stock is still down 25 to 30 percent during this decade.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart conquered the countryside, but Lee Scott was not able to conquer the cities so there were embarrassing losses of supercenters not being approved in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Newark.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuke is the best qualified person to run the company and would be one of the very best people to run any retailer worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. It wasn\u2019t under negative circumstances, this is a normal transition. Wal-Mart probably won\u2019t have any impact at all on the market.\u201d\n\nTHOMAS NYHEIM, VP AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT CHRISTIANA BANK & TRUST CO IN GREENVILLE, DELAWARE\n\n\u201dI think it\u2019s a nonevent. Wal-Mart is pushing well over $400 billion in sales. Their business model is probably the only one that\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cAll the retailers are guiding lower after missing earnings. The business model is still very much intact.\u201d\n\nTERRY MORRIS, SENIOR VP AND SENIOR EQUITY MANAGER AT NATIONAL PENN INVESTORS TRUST COMPANY IN READING PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\u201cIn a business environment where things are in your favor, it does seem odd that someone is stepping down and being replaced.\u201d"

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which is gaining market share amid a global economic downturn, said Lee Scott will retire as chief executive early next year and will be succeeded by Mike Duke, who heads its international operations.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer also promoted Eduardo Castro- Wright, 53, a rising star at the helm of its U.S. operation, to vice chairman, effective immediately.\n\nThe surprise announcement on Friday, landing one week before the crucial Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, comes as Wal-Mart builds on its strength as a discount retailer in a contracting U.S. economy.\n\nDuke, 58, who will become Wal-Mart\u2019s fourth chief executive officer, also takes over as the retailer increasingly looks overseas to fuel expansion as U.S. growth slows.\n\n\u201cSome of you might be wondering why we are making the change at this time,\u201d Chairman Rob Walton said in a memo to employees. \u201cI think Lee said it best when he told me, \u2018This is a great job, but you can\u2019t do it forever and at that point you have an obligation to find the right time for a transition\u2019.\u201d\n\nWalton, son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, said he was \u201dconfident that the strategy we have in place is the right one for future success and Mike has been actively involved in developing and executing this strategy.\n\nThe CEO change is effective February 1, 2009, Wal-Mart said.\n\nAnalysts said the succession plan is being outlined as Wal-Mart gets back on track, boosting profits by persistently focusing on low prices.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good. I\u2018m happy to see it,\u201d said Joseph Feldman, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group, of Duke.\n\nFeldman said the timing of the announcement was \u201ca little strange,\u201d but recalled that, at Wal-Mart\u2019s analyst meeting in October, there was almost a sense that Scott was saying farewell and \u201cfinally had the upper hand over Wall Street.\u201d\n\nHe said Castro-Wright\u2019s promotion could also signal the executive as a future CEO candidate.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart is pushing well over $400 billion in sales,\u201d said Thomas Nyheim, portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust. \u201cTheir business model is probably the only one that\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nScott, 59, has served as CEO since January of 2000, with much of his tenure marked by struggles and a stagnating stock price. From 2000 through 2007, the company\u2019s stock fell 31 percent, with most of the drop coming shortly after his promotion. The stock is up 6.7 percent year-to-date and has outperformed a nearly 49 percent slide in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.\n\nWhen the U.S. economy was roaring along, Wal-Mart found itself losing out to trendier stores such as Target Corp and constantly under attack from groups that accused it of mistreating employees and driving competitors out of business with its massive expansion plans.\n\n\u201cLee Scott has made life harder for Wal-Mart workers,\u201d said David Nassar, executive director of Wal-Mart Watch, a union- backed group critical of the retailer. Scott\u2019s policies have \u201cdiminished Wal-Mart\u2019s reputation and hampered its ability to grow,\u201d he said on Friday.\n\nA foray into fashion and higher-end merchandise failed to draw wealthier shoppers and its profit took a hit last year when it cut prices to clear out poor-selling merchandise. Some company-watchers thought at the time that the missteps could cost Scott his job.\n\nBut Wal-Mart has returned to its low-cost roots and reined in U.S. expansion, which has paid off as the economy soured and cost-conscious consumers come back to its stores.\n\nScott, who joined the company in 1979 as an assistant director of logistics, has also tried to portray Wal-Mart as a world leader committed to tackling tough issues like soaring health-care costs and cleaning up the environment.\n\nScott will remain chairman of the executive committee of the board, receiving an annual salary of $1.1 million, and will be employed through January 31, 2011.\n\nDuke has overseen Wal-Mart\u2019s international operations since 2005 and is fond of saying the retailer should \u201cmajor in the majors\u201d -- focus expansion on global markets where it can become a big player instead of simply planting a flag.\n\nUnder that strategy, the retailer exited its business in Germany and South Korea in 2006 and has pursued growth in countries such as China, Mexico and Canada. Its international operations accounted for almost 25 percent of its $374.5 billion in total sales last year.\n\nBefore overseeing Wal-Mart\u2019s international unit, Duke was the head of Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S. operations. He joined the company in 1995 as senior vice president of logistics.\n\nWal-Mart will announce a new head of international operations by the end of January, when its fiscal year concludes."

The act would make it easier for workers to unionize, by signing a card rather than holding a vote, and Obama was an original co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nWal-Mart has kept its U.S. stores union-free and Corporate America is bracing for a bold offensive from organized labor, which strongly supported Democrat Obama, to push for passage of the legislation.

Duke envisioned using Wal-Mart\u2019s supply chain expertise to reduce spoilage and lower prices in a country with high rates of poverty and hunger.\n\nOne of Duke\u2019s toughest decisions while running the international business was jettisoning Wal-Mart\u2019s money-losing German stores.

Scott will stay on as chairman and be employed through January 31, 2011.\n\n* Scott, 59, joined Wal-Mart in 1979 as an assistant director in the logistics division. After serving in various roles he became president and CEO in 2000.\n\n* Shares of Wal-Mart traded between $64 and $65.94 on January 14, 2000, the day Wal-Mart said then-CEO and President David Glass would immediately step down and be succeeded by Scott. The shares were trading between $50.50 and $52.45 on Friday when the company announced Scott would step down from the CEO post.\n\n* Much of Scott\u2019s tenure as CEO was marked by struggles against trendier stores such as Target Corp. Wal-Mart has also faced attacks from union-backed groups that accused it of mistreating employees, offering poor pay and health benefits and driving competitors out of business.\n\n* An attempt to sell trendy clothing and higher-end merchandise in recent years failed to draw wealthier shoppers. Wal-Mart\u2019s profit took a hit last year when it cut prices to clear out poor-selling merchandise.\n\n* A renewed emphasis on low prices has paid off as cost-conscious consumers now flock to its stores for items such as groceries and medicine. Wal-Mart reported a slightly better-than-expected 10 percent rise in third-quarter profit earlier this month, while Target\u2019s third-quarter profit fell nearly 24 percent.\n\n* During Scott\u2019s tenure Wal-Mart began selling generic drugs at low costs, a move that spread to other retailers. Wal-Mart also asked suppliers to meet stricter environmental standards, including reducing the amount of packaging and improving energy efficiency of products sold at its stores.\n\n* Beginning February 1, 2009, Scott\u2019s annual salary will be $1.1 million. In fiscal 2008, Scott\u2019s annual base salary was $1.4 million. Scott will be eligible for an incentive payment for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009 but will not be entitled to an incentive payment for fiscal 2010 or after that.\n\n* Wal-Mart said it would accelerate certain restricted stock grants that are scheduled to vest at age 65 to vest on February 1, 2011 as long as Scott meets certain requirements including extending a non-compete agreement through March 14, 2016.\n\n* Scott\u2019s unvested stock options, restricted stock and performance shares will continue to vest through January 31, 2011, with several exceptions. Scott will forfeit 25 percent of the 208,508 target performance shares he received on January 22, 2007, 25 percent of the 55,608 target performance shares he received on March 26, 2007, and 50 percent of the 299,496 target performance shares he received on January 21, 2008."
