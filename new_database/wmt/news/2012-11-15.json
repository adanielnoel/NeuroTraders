        "body": "* S&P 500 down about 2 pct for the week so far\n\nNEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell in choppy trading on Thursday, with the S&P 500 on track to fall for a third day, as Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported disappointing results and investors feared the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d will harm the economy.\n\nStocks have struggled recently to hold onto even slight gains, such as on Wednesday when they opened higher but ended down more than 1 percent.\n\nInvestors worry the economy could slip into recession if no deal is reached in Washington to avoid the fiscal cliff - budget cuts and tax hikes that begin to take effect in the new year. The S&P 500 is off about 2 percent for the week so far.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who plans to meet with Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress on Friday, pressed his bargaining position at a news conference Wednesday that the wealthy must pay more in taxes as part of a deal.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the market, all eyes now are on the congressional meeting tomorrow with the White House,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, managing director at Miller Tabak & Co in New York.\n\n\u201cWith a very oversold market and bearishness at the individual investor level at the highest since August 2011, a bounce is due if there is any positive commentary in that meeting,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the recent decline, the S&P 500 is up 7.5 percent so far this year, though at its 2012 peak the benchmark index was up about 17 percent.\n\nWal-Mart fell 4 percent to $68.50 after reporting third-quarter revenue that missed expectations. The company said economic conditions pressured customers\u2019 spending. Target Corp rose 1.5 percent to $62.32 after it reported a profit that beat expectations.\n\nWeekly jobless benefits claims spiked last week, reflecting the impact of superstorm Sandy. The storm also hurt economic activity in the mid-Atlantic states. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s business activity index for last month fell more than expected, sending stocks lower.\n\nThe index is one of the early indicators of a national manufacturing report later from the Institute for Supply Management.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to somehow have to carve out the business activity in the Northeast of late in order to get an accurate pulse of the state of the rest of the national economy,\u201d Boockvar said.\n\nThe government also said the cost of living rose by 0.1 percent last month. The report showed the rate of inflation holding steady, which was seen giving the Federal Reserve room to continue its stimulative monetary policy.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was down 59.53 points, or 0.47 percent, at 12,511.42. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was down 6.27 points, or 0.46 percent, at 1,349.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 16.53 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,830.28.\n\nBoth the Dow and Nasdaq ended at their lowest levels since late June on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 is down about 5 percent since election night. Wednesday marked the benchmark index\u2019s lowest close since July 25.\n\nNetApp Inc surged 10.7 percent to $30.04 a day after reporting adjusted second-quarter earnings that beat expectations and forecasting a strong current quarter.\n\nOverseas, Israel launched a major offensive against Palestinian militants in Gaza, killing the military commander of Hamas in an air strike and threatening an invasion of the enclave. Egypt recalled its ambassador from Israel in response.\n\nEnergy shares rose amid tensions in the Middle East, as any disruption in crude supplies could spark a jump in oil prices. Brent crude rose 1.1 percent while oilfield services company Halliburton Co rose 1.4 percent to $30.35."

        "body": "Nov 15 (Reuters) - The Indian government will ask Wal-Mart Stores Inc to turn over some documents as part of a probe into whether the U.S. retailer violated foreign ownership rules, the Press Trust of India reported late on Thursday.\n\nA Communist Party lawmaker has accused Wal-Mart of \u201cclandestinely and illegally\u201d investing $100 million in the multi-brand retail business of its wholesale joint venture partner, Bharti Enterprises, as early as 2010, before India allowed foreign companies to operate front-end stores.\n\nA Wal-Mart spokesman, Kevin Gardner, told Reuters that the retailer is in compliance with Indian law. \u201cThe Central Government has sought certain information and clarification which has been provided by us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a position to offer further comments as the matter is before the courts.\u201d\n\nAccording to the newspaper report, India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate, a federal investigative agency, will formally notify Wal-Mart to hand over documents related to investments and payments to its Indian partner as part of the probe into whether it violated foreign ownership rules.\n\nIndia\u2019s central bank advised the Enforcement Directorate to probe the investments for possible violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, the newspaper said, quoting an unnamed source close to the matter.\n\nIndia recently allowed foreign retailers to own up to 51 percent in supermarkets, a decision made in the face of fierce political opposition. Previously, Wal-Mart and other foreign players were only allowed to own wholesale operations.\n\nWal-Mart was the most vocal advocate for the rule change and is expected to open its first retail store within 18 months. Enforcement Directorate officials could not immediately be reached for comment."

        "body": "* S&P 500 falls 5.1 percent over the last six sessions\n\nNEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat on Thursday, with investors again finding few reasons to buy amid weak results from retail giant Wal-Mart and tensions in the Middle East.\n\nFutures were off their highs of the session, continuing a trend of equities having difficulty holding onto gains. Futures had also indicated gains Wednesday morning, but stocks turned lower midday and ended down more than 1 percent.\n\nEroding gains in Dow futures, Wal-Mart Stores fell 3. 2 percent to $69 in premarket trading after reporting third-quarter revenue that missed expectations and saying macroeconomic conditions continued to pressure its customers.\n\n\u201cThis is troubling because it flies in the face of other retail data we\u2019ve seen lately, which has been positive,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. \u201cThere\u2019s not much out there convincing investors that things are getting any better.\u201d\n\nTarget Corp eased back to $61. 36 before the bell e ven as the company reported higher quarterly profit.\n\nOverseas, Israel launched a major offensive against Palestinian militants in Gaza, killing the military commander of Hamas in an air strike and threatening an invasion of the enclave. Egypt said it recalled its ambassador from Israel in response.\n\nCrude oil may be the most directly impacted by the tensions in the region, with any disruption to oil supply leaving crude vulnerable to a spike in prices. Brent crude rose 1 percent and is up 4.7 percent over the past two weeks.\n\n\u201cNothing over there seem stable, and investors are concerned other countries could be pulled into the conflict. You\u2019re going to see oil jump on that threat,\u201d Forest said.\n\nS&P 500 futures were flat but still slightly above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 25 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 2.75 points.\n\nWith Wednesday\u2019s drop, both the Dow and Nasdaq ended at their lowest levels since late June. The S&P 500 is down 5.1 percent in the six sessions since election night. Wednesday marked the benchmark index\u2019s lowest close since July 25.\n\nInvestors may seek bargains at these levels, and a round of stronger economic data could prove to be a catalyst, but many analysts say strong gains may be hard to come by until at least one of the many global macroeconomic headwinds have been resolved.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all this uncertainty out there, and the market is unbalanced because those who want to buy can be very discriminate about the price they want to buy at,\u201d Forest said.\n\nThe market will also watch the latest economic data, with weekly jobless claims, October consumer prices and a November read on New York manufacturing all due out at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT). The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank releases its November business activity survey at 10 a.m.\n\nClaims are seen rising by 20,000 to 375,000 while consumer prices are seen up 0.1 percent, compared with a 0.6 percent rise in September, according to a Reuters poll. The Empire State manufacturing survey is seen coming in at -6.7, compared with -6.16 in October. The Philly Fed survey is seen dropping to 2 from 5.7 in October.\n\nWhile the President and Congress are unlikely to reach a definitive agreement for weeks, investors will continue to monitor the situation regarding the fiscal cliff, a series of mandated tax increases and spending cuts will start to take effect early next year that could push the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\nPresident Barack Obama Wednesday reiterated his position that marginal tax rates would have to rise to tackle the nation\u2019s deficits. Taxes on capital gains and dividends also could rise as part of the negotiations, pushing investors to sell this year and pay lower taxes on their gains."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) posted disappointing quarterly sales on Thursday as shoppers in key markets like the United States battled high gasoline prices and unemployment, while store traffic continued to decline in China.\n\nLower prices for some food and electronics reduced Walmart\u2019s U.S. sales, and growth at the company\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club unit also fell short of Wall Street expectations - rising at half the rate compared with a year ago.\n\nClub members, who pay a fee to shop there, bought cheaper items and traffic from business customers slowed. The results were especially disconcerting to Wall Street since Sam\u2019s Club has regularly outperformed Wal-Mart\u2019s discount stores.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a slowdown in sales and then pressure in traffic, that causes investors to be cautious,\u201d Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones, said of Sam\u2019s Club.\n\nTraffic at Walmart\u2019s U.S. stores was essentially flat, as shoppers consolidated trips due to higher gasoline prices.\n\nAdding to Wal-Mart\u2019s worries, the world\u2019s largest retailer also said it has opened internal inquiries or investigations into bribery allegations in Brazil, China and India - additions to its original probe in Mexico. A New York Times article in April disclosed alleged bribery at its Mexican unit.\n\n\u201cWe fear this could spread further and be much bigger than just Mexico,\u201d Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said.\n\nChief Financial Officer Charles Holley declined to comment further on the issue during a conference call with reporters.\n\nSo far the total cost of the probe has reached $98 million this year.\n\nWal-Mart shares were down 3.6 percent at $68.73 in Thursday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange as investors absorbed the details of how the global economic slowdown is hitting the company.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re in the UK or you\u2019re in Argentina, Mexico or China or the U.S. or Canada, I think that all consumers are starting to be under some kind of pressure,\u201d Holley said on the conference call.\n\nWal-Mart did say that U.S. sales so far this month were better than expected, a good sign heading into the holiday shopping season.\n\nIn the tough economy, Walmart is still well placed to cater to budget-conscious shoppers, said Natalie Berg, director of global research at Planet Retail.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, consumers are still very wary about parting with their hard-earned cash,\u201d she said.\n\nTotal sales rose 3.4 percent to $113.20 billion for the third quarter ended October 31. Analysts, on average, looked for $114.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, sales would have been $114.9 billion, the company said.\n\nSales at Walmart U.S. stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 1.5 percent. The company had forecast an increase of 1 percent to 3 percent, and analysts, on average, had looked for a 1.8 percent gain as management expressed optimism during a recent meeting with analysts.\n\nIn contrast, rival Target Corp (TGT.N) on Thursday reported a quarterly profit that beat analysts\u2019 expectations, luring shoppers with a wider variety of food products and 5 percent discounts for its cardholders.\n\nWhile shoppers put millions of dollars of merchandise on layaway, those sales are not registered by Wal-Mart until the items are paid in full. That typically occurs in the fourth quarter, closer to the end of the holiday season.\n\nTraffic at the U.S. stores rose only 0.1 percent as shoppers consolidated trips due to higher gasoline prices.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. unit forecast a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in same-store sales for the fourth quarter.\n\nSam\u2019s Club results also disappointed, with same-store sales rising 2.7 percent, excluding gasoline sales, compared with a 5.7 percent increase a year earlier.\n\nOverall, the world\u2019s largest retailer earned $3.64 billion, or $1.08 per share, in the third quarter ended October 31, up from $3.34 billion, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nInternational sales rose 2.4 percent to $33.16 billion, and would have risen 7.6 percent without currency fluctuations, the company said. Operating profit rose 4.8 percent.\n\nTraffic declined 7.6 percent at its stores in China, continuing a string of declines, and it is facing challenges in Japan due to the economy. Sales there fell 1.8 percent and traffic declined 1.7 percent."
