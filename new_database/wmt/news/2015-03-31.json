        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it would omit a shareholder proposal that sought to link executive pay to a measure of staff motivation from a vote at its annual meeting in June after the U.S. securities regulator ruled in the retailer\u2019s favor.\n\nThe proposal was submitted by Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier in December. It called for a measure of \u201cemployee engagement\u201d to be used in tandem with financial metrics in determining the pay of senior executives.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission sided with Wal-Mart\u2019s assertion that it could be omitted on the grounds that it had already been \u201csubstantially implemented\u201d in other ways by the company, according to the ruling posted on the SEC\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThe SEC agreed that it could be excluded again this year on that basis,\u201d Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said, referring to a similar version of the proposal that failed to make the ballot last year as well.\n\nThe fate of the proposal had been in focus after Wal-Mart announced in February that it would raise its minimum wage in a move that was in part aimed at better engaging with and retaining its rank-and-file staff.\n\nWhile Nappier applauded Wal-Mart\u2019s decision on wages she had argued that her proposal was still needed to ensure that Wal-Mart was committed to investing in its workers over the longer term. Her office oversees $40 million worth of the retailer\u2019s shares in state pension and trust funds.\n\nEarlier this month the SEC ruled against Wal-Mart in its bid to omit a separate shareholder proposal, submitted by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund, that calls for an independent board chairman."
