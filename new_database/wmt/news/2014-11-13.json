        "body": "(Reuters) - Wal-Mart stores Inc (WMT.N) issued an \u201curgent agenda\u201d memo to its store managers across the United States last month, laying out guidelines to boost sales of \u201cchilled and fresh\u201d food, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe memo, marked \"highly sensitive\", asks Wal-Mart marketing managers to make sure they discount aging meat and baked goods to maximize chances of selling them before their expiration dates, according to the report. (nyti.ms/1v1YwHO)\n\nWal-Mart, which has posted six straight quarters of flat or declining same-store sales growth, has been battling a stronger dollar and a reduction in U.S. food stamp benefits, which has eaten into the budget of the retailer\u2019s core customer base.\n\nThe Times said the memo calls for comprehensive markdowns across 32 departments, asks stores to find creative ways to sell clearance items and to keep \u201ccomplete records of daily throws\u201d of meat and poultry.\n\n\u201cOur CEO has been vocal about our need to improve in this (fresh foods) category. We know it\u2019s very important to our customer and ... to us as the largest grocer in the U.S.,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nThe memo, which the Times said was leaked for public use by a Wal-Mart manager unhappy about understaffing, urges managers to reduce inventory and warns them not to exceed budgets.\n\nFor meat departments, the report cited the memo as saying markdowns should start at 7 a.m. and be executed multiple times daily.\n\nThe memo also advises stores to be sure to \u201crotate\u201d dairy products and eggs, which means removing expired items and adding new stock at the bottom and back of display cases, the Times said."
