        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Inc (WMT.N) has agreed to revise a plan on a payroll cut involving 2,000 mid-level managers across its outlets in China after a trade union stepped in to mediate, state media reported on Friday.\n\nThe Shenzhen Federation of Trade Union became involved after the company announced it would eliminate a layer of management in all its stores, leaving affected employees the option of taking a lower position with lower pay, Xinhua news agency said.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s China unit, based in southern Shenzhen, has 147 outlets and over 50,000 employees.\n\n\u201cThe company will give a one-off reward of 3,000 yuan ($440) to those who agree to be transferred to work in other stores, or receive training offered by the company,\u201d Wang Tongxin, vice chairman of the union, was cited by Xinhua as saying.\n\n\u201cAfter talks with the employee representatives, Wal-Mart has taken the concerns of the employees and made big revisions to its plan, which finally reached a win-win situation,\u201d said Wang.\n\nAn official from the company also confirmed the news.\n\n\u201cAfter revision, our program is going well. A growing number of employees understood the company\u2019s strategy and are willing to accept the arrangement,\u201d Chen Lu, a Wal-Mart China public relations official, was quoted as saying.\n\nWal-Mart first allowed unions into its Chinese stores in 2006, during a government campaign to expand the presence of unions into foreign multinationals.\n\nBut Xinhua quoted some employees as saying it would take time to rebuild trust.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure now whether the company can keep its promise,\u201d an anonymous Wal-Mart manager in Shenzhen was quoted as saying."
