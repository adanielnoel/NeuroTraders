Analysts expected a 2.5 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates.\n\nWal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, stood by its third-quarter profit forecast calling for earnings of 73 cents to 76 cents per share from continuing operations.\n\nSame-store sales jumped 7 percent at Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), less than the 7.5 percent increase analysts expected.\n\nOverall, U.S. retailers were expected to post a rise of 1.5 percent in monthly same-store sales, slightly above the 1.4 percent rise a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nExcluding Wal-Mart, a gain of 0.4 percent was expected overall in monthly same-store sales for retailers, while department stores and specialty apparel chains were seen posting steep declines.\n\nClothing retailers continued to suffer in September, as consumers avoided spending on discretionary items such as clothes and accessories.\n\nSame-store sales at Pacific Sunwear of California Inc PSUN.O fell 5 percent, better than the analysts\u2019 target. But it expects third-quarter earnings at the low end of its forecast for nil to 5 cents a share as it had to mark down more of its clothing.\n\nSame-store sales fell 7.5 percent at Wet Seal Inc WTSLA.O, and were flat at Children\u2019s Place Retail Stores Inc (PLCE.O) -- both worse than anticipated.\n\nSame-store sales fell 6 percent at women's clothing retailer Cache Inc CACH.O, as expected by analysts.
