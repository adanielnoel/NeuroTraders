        "body": "NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc\u2019s (WMT.N) treasurer said on Thursday that he is \u201cconfident\u201d Congress will defeat proposed legislation that would make it easier for employees to form a union.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Employee Free Choice Act was introduced in both houses of Congress. The bill, also referred to as card check legislation, would let employees form a union if a majority of them in a workplace sign authorization cards.\n\nThat would change the present practice in which workers usually vote in elections on unionizing, although the bill would leave elections as an option for employees to choose.\n\nEarlier this week, Citigroup downgraded Wal-Mart shares to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy,\u201d saying the proposed card check legislation would increase labor costs and could be a significant drag to earnings for the world\u2019s largest retailer.\n\nSpeaking at the Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch consumer conference, which was broadcast over the Internet, Wal-Mart Treasurer Charles Holley said the retailer is \u201cvery opposed to the bill\u201d and it is \u201cvery anti-competitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that Congress will get it right, they\u2019ll figure this thing out, and this bill will be defeated,\u201d he said.\n\nHolley also said that Wal-Mart, which has been gaining market share amid the U.S. recession, intends to remain the low price leader as shoppers across the board seek out what Wal-Mart calls its \u201cEvery day low prices,\u201d or EDLP.\n\n\u201cThe customers not only need the EDLP, they really are starting to really rely on it on all levels,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the consumers that you consider a little higher income, those maybe making over $65,000 versus those making under $65,000, you would see that we\u2019re gaining market share equally in both at the same rate. It\u2019s not split,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everybody now is really focused on saving money.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart shares rose 2.3 percent to $48.56 in recent morning trading.
