        "body": "Handheld-giant Nokia and Microsoft, the world\u2019s largest software company, on Tuesday announced the first fruit of their recent mobile-productivity pact: Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia handhelds and the Symbian platform.\n\nMicrosoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia, which is initially available free of charge in English for Nokia\u2019s E52 and E72 devices via the Nokia Ovi mobile software store, is an enterprise collaboration tool that connects directly with Microsoft Exchange corporate systems. More specifically, the new app lets users view colleagues\u2019 status and availability and then click to contact them via various methods including IM, e-mail, text and voice. Colleagues\u2019 names and statuses are listed in users\u2019 contact applications, so they can update their own presence, initiate or join in on existing IM sessions, and place new calls from that central location.\n\nThe announcement is aimed directly at BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion (RIM) and its enterprise users. RIM currently offers a variety of comparable collaboration tools for BlackBerry deployments in Microsoft Exchange environments, such as its BlackBerry client for Microsoft\u2019s Office Communications Server (OCS). And the new Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia brings much of the same functionality to Nokia smartphone users.\n\n\u201cThis application really provides a much more efficient way to work with others, as you can see if someone is busy or available and the best way to start a conversation with them,\u201d said Ukko Lappalainen, vice president at Nokia, in a press release. \u201cIt also meets all of the requirements for the enterprise: cost-effective to implement, secure, familiar and reliable.\u201d\n\nThe Nokia/Microsoft pact was first announced last August, and Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia is just the first product the companies plan to release for the enterprise market in the coming months and years.\n\nAdditional device support for handhelds including Nokia\u2019s new E5 device is expected in the near future. And Nokia plans to pre-install the client on select handhelds, as well.\n\n<a href=\u201chttp://www.cio.com/topic/3061/Mobile_Wireless\u201d>Read more about mobile/wireless</a>] in CIO\u2019s Mobile/Wireless Drilldown."

Or you can use a commercial program like WinZip that\u2019s packed with all sorts of goodies, but you have to pay for it. Or you can use 7-Zip, which gives you a couple of the most important features for free. It\u2019s available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.\n\nFor instance, 7-Zip can compress and decompress WinZip-compatible AES-encrypted .zip files. That\u2019s vital if you need to e-mail sensitive data, because the .zip format\u2019s standard password protection (the only kind Windows supports) is easy to crack. But with 7-Zip, you can share truly-secure data with people who use WinZip, PKZip, WinRar, PowerArchiver, and other programs. And if they use none of those programs and don\u2019t want to spend money, you can tell them to get 7-Zip.\n\n7-Zip also allows you to compress and e-mail files in one easy step. Just right-click a file or files in Windows Explorer and select 7-Zip\u00b8 then Compress and email. It even has its own compression format, although I recommend sticking to .zip for compatibility purposes.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that 7-Zip will satisfy every WinZip fan. It can\u2019t compress a .zip into an .exe. And the user interface is plain, dull, and unattractive. It can also be intimidating, offering options that most users should never have to think about.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to. The default settings are just fine. For most compression tasks, 7-Zip does the job."

The software is the first result of the partnership they announced in August last year.\n\nThe Communicator Mobile client connects with Microsoft\u2019s Office Communications Server 2007 R2, and let users see their colleagues\u2019 availability and communicate with them using instant messaging, e-mail, SMS (Short Message Service) or a call from the phone\u2019s address book, according to Nokia.\n\nThe ability to see when and how colleagues are available -- commonly referred to as presence -- and send instant messages are the key features, a Nokia spokesman said via e-mail.\n\nThe voice calls will be made via the phone network, but a future version will also be able to make calls over IP, he added, without providing any details. Today, voice-over-IP calls can instead be made using Microsoft\u2019s PC client, Office Communicator, which also integrates with Office Communications Server.\n\nInitially, Microsoft Communicator Mobile will be available on the Nokia E72 and the E52 handsets, and owners of those devices can download the English version of the software from Nokia\u2019s Ovi Store. Nokia plans to ship the software on certain smartphones in future, and to support additional devices, including the recently announced Nokia E5.\n\nUntil now, Microsoft has only offered its enterprise customers a Windows Mobile-based mobile client, something that has held Office Communications Server back, according to Steve Blood, vice president and agenda manager at Gartner. Companies have instead been turning to PBX and third-party software vendors that offer a wider support for different mobile operating systems.\n\nThe addition of support for Symbian is a step in the right direction, but now Microsoft has to \u201cdance with the devil\u201d and also add support for the iPhone, Android-based smartphones and Research In Motion\u2019s BlackBerry phones, according to Blood.\n\nSince the announcement in August, Nokia and Microsoft have been collaborating on the design and development of \u201cnew solutions\u201d. However, they have not yet said what that will lead to beyond Communicator Mobile."

Spindex is a new FUSE Labs project to help aggregate and streamline social streams to help you interact more efficiently.\n\nLili Cheng, general manager of Microsoft FUSE Labs, wrote in a blog post on The Official Microsoft Blog \u201cOne area we\u2019ve been focused on lately is the personalization of social computing. As you increasingly tweet, post to Facebook, and capture ideas with tools like Evernote, we want to help you get the most out of your social activity by exposing the right information, at the right time, in a way that\u2019s meaningful.\u201d\n\nAs social networking has grown it has also become unwieldy and cumbersome. What began as a small clique of friends or family has spiraled out of control into hundreds or thousands of connections spanning multiple social network services. Spindex will enable you to connect to and consolidate information streams from Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, RSS feeds, and Bing--for starters.\n\nTo be fair, Microsoft is not the first to attempt such an aggregation of social networking. Tweetdeck, which is my default tool on my Windows 7 notebook, my iPhone, and my iPad for working with Twitter is also capable of connecting with and posting to Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn--providing a fairly comprehensive interface for managing social networks. Lifestream, from AOL, also provides one-stop shopping for social networks including all of the ones from Tweetdeck, as well as Digg, YouTube, Flickr, and more.\n\nSpindex puts a unique spin on the concept, though, by providing personalized trending topics. The keywords and hot topics among your personal social network are much more relevant to you than what the world at large is following. In addition, Spindex proactively seeks out articles and information via Bing and provides you with links to dig deeper and learn more.\n\nThe Spindex site describes it \u201cMake sense of your social overload, open your personalized Spindex page, and find out at a glance what topics are hot in your social world. You can also keep track of the things you are remembering via Evernote--right inside of your Spindex page. Spindex is not just a social reader--as you browse your friends\u2019 updates, Spindex continually suggests related content from Bing--giving you better insight into the topics and trends spinning around you.\u201d\n\nFUSE Labs has also been behind some other recent Microsoft innovations such as Bing Twitter Maps, Docs.com, and Outlook Social Connectors. The Outlook Social Connectors concept is also aimed at engaging social networks more efficiently, but from an opposite perspective from Spindex. Where Spindex consolidates social streams into a single console, Outlook Social Connectors enable you to separate social streams by contact and quickly find message threads and status updates affiliated with a specific individual.\n\nSpindex is currently available only as a CTP (community technology preview) for attendees of the Web 2.0 Expo. Stay tuned to FUSE Labs to find out when it will be available to the general public. I will be keeping my eyes open for an opportunity to play with this new tool.\n\nYou can follow Tony on his Facebook page , or contact him by email at tony_bradley@pcworld.com .

        "body": "Making good on a promise two months ago, Microsoft today updated its Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) preview, a sneak peek that targets Web developers and others eager to try out the company\u2019s next browser.\n\n\u201cThe Platform Preview continues to be the thinnest possible wrapper around the Web platform, and as such is not intended for general purpose browsing,\u201d cautioned Dean Hachamovich, the browser team\u2019s general manager, in an entry on the IE blog today.\n\nIn mid-March, Microsoft committed to updating the IE9 preview every eight weeks until it issues a public beta. The company again declined to reveal its timeline plans for a beta or a final of the next-generation browser.\n\nMicrosoft also updated the supporting IE9 Test Drive site with new samples to show what developers can do with its graphics processor-powered HTML, a key feature of the browser that boosts text and graphics rendering by offloading those chores to the PC\u2019s GPU (graphics processor unit).\n\nIE9\u2019s preview will not run on the nearly-nine-year-old Windows XP, because the browser relies on APIs (application programming interfaces) built into Windows 7 and added to Vista and Server 2008 R2 in October 2009. The final version won\u2019t run in XP either, Microsoft has confirmed.\n\nHachamovich claimed that the second IE9 preview renders JavaScript about 20% faster than the March edition, and 36% faster than Mozilla\u2019s Firefox 3.6. Microsoft\u2019s early code, however, still lags behind the leaders -- Apple \u2019s Safari, Google \u2019s Chrome and Opera Software\u2019s Opera -- in SunSpider benchmark scores. Opera, for instance, was half again as fast as IE9\u2019s Platform Preview 2.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s results nearly match those of recent Computerworld SunSpider tests, which showed that Chrome\u2019s newest beta was almost 20% faster than the current \u201cstable\u201d build, and that Opera continued to take honors as the fastest Windows browser.\n\nThe company also touted progress in the widely-used Acid3 benchmark, which checks how closely a browser follows certain standards, particularly specifications related to DOM (Document Object Model), CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheets 2) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Hachamovich said IE9 Platform Preview 2 scored 68 out of a possible 100 on Acid3, an improvement over the 55 scored by Platform Preview 1.\n\nUnlike full-fledged editions of IE, the IE9 preview runs alongside existing versions of IE, such as IE7 on Vista or IE8 on Windows 7. Users can install the update overtop the March edition, Microsoft said.\n\nMicrosoft has said nothing about its goals for IE9\u2019s adoption, but the company has to be concerned with the gradual decline of Internet Explorer\u2019s usage share, which has been on a downward line for years and shows no sign of heading upward. The most recent data from Web analytics firm NetApplications puts IE\u2019s usage share at just under 60%, a record low.\n\nIE8 has not been able to turn that around. Since IE8\u2019s March 2009 launch, Microsoft has lost 7.8 percentage points in usage share, only slightly less than the 9.2 points it lost in the 12 months preceding IE8\u2019s debut.\n\nThe second preview is a 15MB download, and can be obtained from Microsoft\u2019s site .\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .
