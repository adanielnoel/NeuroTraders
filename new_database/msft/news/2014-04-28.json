        "body": "April 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it will increase its cloud storage offering for business users by 40-fold as the world\u2019s largest software company makes a case for businesses buying an all-in-one product from itself rather than buying technology \u201cpiecemeal\u201d from multiple sellers.\n\n\u201cThe era of making isolated, single-solution decisions is rapidly coming to a close,\u201d wrote John Case, corporate vice president of Microsoft Office Division. Microsoft on Monday raised its OneDrive for Business storage to 1TB per user from 25GB.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s pitch to be the one-stop destination for companies looking to buy technology runs against efforts by smaller rivals such as Box and Dropbox that offer one or two specialized services.\n\nMicrosoft did not name its rivals but made a reference to them in the headline of its blog post titled \"Thinking outside the box.\" (link.reuters.com/byj88v)\n\nDropbox spokeswoman declined to comment on the Microsoft move. Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie fired back in a blog post, criticizing Microsoft for keeping its storage software \u201cclosed\u201d and making it difficult for users to move their data between different services.\n\n\"By keeping Office 365 users on the closed OneDrive \"island,\" Microsoft is stranding hundreds of millions of users and customers that have chosen Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and others,\" Levie wrote in response to Microsoft's move. (r.reuters.com/pyj88v)\n\nOnline document-sharing company Dropbox is a Silicon Valley startup that has proved a hit with consumers and boasts more than 200 million users six years after it was started. It has undergone tremendous growth amid the meteoric rise of cloud, which is expected to continue booming alongside mobile computing.\n\nWhile Dropbox won plaudits for its ease-of-use and gained traction among individual users, Levie focused Box in recent years toward catering to corporate customers who demanded greater levels of administrative control and security.\n\nBoth companies are expected to go public in the coming months.\n\nCloud services have become increasingly popular among both cash-strapped tech startups and larger companies, which rely on computers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc instead of buying the equipment themselves.\n\nInvestors are excited about Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella\u2019s focus on mobile and cloud computing, designed to take Microsoft beyond its traditional PC-based Windows business.\n\nMicrosoft, which reported results Thursday, saw Nadella\u2019s emphasis on cloud computing help its server software business in the third quarter, while a softer-than-expected decline in PC sales limited damage to the bottom line.

        "body": "NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week.\n\nWith an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called \u201cEvery Street United.\u201d Sony Corp\u2019s digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called \u201cConnected.\u201d\n\nThis is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long \u201cNewFronts\u201d event - modeled after the annual \u201cupfronts\u201d where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue.\n\nYahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized.\n\nYahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo\u2019s earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars,\u201d said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos.\n\nBut TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said.\n\n\u201cOnline video just doesn\u2019t offer nearly the reach that broadcast does,\u201d said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio\u2019s films on the AOL network for free, but with ads.\n\n\u201cInternet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space,\u201d Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. \u201cBut we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens.\u201d\n\nAt the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company\u2019s Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet\u2019s strengths.\n\n\u201cThe challenge TV has is it\u2019s not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components,\u201d said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. \u201cWe have very engaged, high-quality audiences.\u201d\n\nOnline series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week.\n\n\u201cThere is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television,\u201d Naylor said. \u201cOnline video is a way to reach those light TV viewers.\u201d\n\nBut because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV.\n\nThe cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives,\u201d said Wieser. \u201cThe reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget.\u201d\n\nAnother hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising Bureau which hosts the event.\n\nAri Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry\u2019s annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online.\n\nHowever, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars.\n\nUntil then, the NewFronts \u201cis more of a showcase for what\u2019s new and exciting,\u201d Bluman said."

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought an end to Novell Inc\u2019s antitrust claims against Microsoft Corp that date back 20 years to the development of Windows 95 software.\n\nBy declining to hear Novell\u2019s appeal, the court left intact a 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling from September 2013 in favor of Microsoft.\n\nThe court of appeals unanimously affirmed the dismissal of Novell Inc\u2019s claims that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act when it decided not to share its intellectual property while developing its Windows 95 operating system.\n\nNovell was seeking more than $3 billion.\n\nSince the 1990s, Microsoft has been pursued by government prosecutors, consumers and competitors for alleged antitrust violations when it was widely considered a mighty monopolist.\n\nThe Novell case, which was first filed in 2004, was over Microsoft\u2019s decision not to share with Novell details about its Windows operating system. Novell claimed that its suite of applications, including WordPerfect, suffered as a result of Microsoft withholding the information.\n\nNovell alleged that Microsoft used its market power in operating systems to promote its own applications.\n\nIn a 2011 trial, a jury could not come to a verdict, but afterward U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore, who oversaw consolidated proceedings against Microsoft, ruled in favor of the software giant.\n\nNovell appealed Motz\u2019s ruling to the 10th Circuit but the court affirmed Motz\u2019s ruling, finding that Microsoft was under no obligation to share sensitive information with a competitor.\n\nThe case is Novell v. Microsoft, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-1042."
