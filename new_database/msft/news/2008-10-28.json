        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A top Chinese copyright official chided Microsoft for launching an anti-piracy tool that nags users of counterfeit software with a black computer screen and said the company\u2019s prices were too high.\n\nThe U.S. software giant launched \u201cWindows Genuine Advantage\u201d in China last week, a programme that turns the background of the Windows operating system\u2019s desktop black if the software fails a validation test.\n\nThe move prompted lawsuit threats and howls of indignation in China, where the vast majority of computer users are believed to be using pirated versions, unwittingly or not.\n\nNational Copyright Administration (NCA) Vice-Director Yan Xiaohong said his agency supported \u201cthe rights-safeguarding move taken by institutions including Microsoft,\u201d Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying in a report late on Monday.\n\nBut companies should \u201cpay attention to the methods,\u201d Yan said. \u201cWhether the \u2018black-out\u2019 method should be adopted is open to question. Measures for safeguarding rights also need to be appropriate,\u201d Yan said.\n\nMicrosoft has defended the programme as a measure to protect its intellectual property and help customers determine that they have legal software.\n\nMethods to subvert the programme were circulated on Chinese blogs and Internet chat-rooms within days of its launch.\n\nDong Zhengwei, a Beijing lawyer, said Microsoft was abusing its market power and had filed a complaint to China\u2019s trade watchdog, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Daily said in separate report.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft should be fined $1 billion,\u201d the paper quoted the lawyer as saying.\n\nYan said Microsoft\u2019s price policies needed to \u201cfit the Chinese situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company adopted unified prices in the past without considering the income gap between developed and developing countries, so we need to kindly remind them that Chinese customers\u2019 affordability should be considered.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s China office denied users were being forced to use the anti-piracy programme and pointed to recent sales promotions cutting prices of its software in China.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the NCA\u2019s understanding and support on efforts made by right holders including Microsoft to protect IPR,\u201d it said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBuilding a market environment that respects intellectual property rights is critical to the development of the entire software industry and of knowledge economy in China.\u201d"

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The next upgrade of Office business software from Microsoft Corp will include a version that edits word processing documents and spreadsheets inside a Web browser, the software maker said on Tuesday.\n\nThe online version of Office, which includes the Word and Excel programs, aims to prevent competitors such as Google Inc from pecking away at Microsoft\u2019s dominance in software used by office workers and expand the market for one of its most profitable products.\n\nMicrosoft would not comment on when it plans to release the next version of Office, dubbed \u201cOffice 14,\u201d but in the past it has shipped an upgrade every two to three years. It introduced the current Office suite of programs in January 2007.\n\nThe company said Office Web applications will offer lightweight, online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint presentation software and the OneNote collaboration program. Office files can be managed and edited on a normal desktop computer, a Web browser or a mobile phone.\n\nMicrosoft, the world\u2019s largest software maker, has seen a wave of competitors from Web start-ups to Google offering word processing, presentation and spreadsheet software over the Internet for free with advertising or a monthly subscription.\n\n\u201cNobody, none of our competitors, will do as good of a job on the phone, the browser or the PC,\u201d said Chris Capossela, a senior vice president at Microsoft\u2019s Office business.\n\nThe company announced the news at the Professional Developer\u2019s Conference, Microsoft\u2019s annual gathering of engineers to detail the company\u2019s future plans.\n\nMicrosoft has mostly resisted the push to make its Office suite available online, choosing to sell licenses to run the applications locally on a single computer. It allows users to share files through Office Live, which is free with advertising or available with more functions for a monthly subscription.\n\nGoogle Apps, a free suite of Web services aimed at business users, includes calendar, collaboration, e-mail and messaging software, as well as online spreadsheets and word processing.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s announcement did not surprise David Girouard, president of Google\u2019s enterprise division, who saw the move as an endorsement of its business model for running programs in its powerful data centers and delivering those applications as services over the Web.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an acknowledgment of all the progress we\u2019ve made with Google Apps in the last 18 months,\u201d said Girouard, noting that Google has 10 million business users running Google Apps.\n\nMicrosoft said the new Office Web applications will be available for consumers on Office Live, although it did not disclose whether it would be paid for by advertising or subscriptions.\n\nFor large corporate customers, they can either pay for a license to run those applications online using their own computer servers, or run those programs in Microsoft\u2019s data centers for a monthly fee.\n\nMicrosoft said users will be able to view Word documents or Excel spreadsheets in the same way regardless of whether they are using a Web browser or on a standard desktop. The online Office version also has a similar look and feel to the desktop applications, albeit with less functions.\n\nThe new Office Web applications will work on Internet Explorer, Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and Apple Inc\u2019s Safari browsers. They will be available for a technical preview sometime this year, according to Microsoft.\n\nCapossela sees the applications expanding the base of Office users, notably employees who do not work on a computer sitting on a desk -- nurses, truck drivers or factory workers -- but require some business software accessible over the Web.\n\nIt also offers, Capossela notes, the opportunity to make money in the form of advertising or subscriptions for a software product that is heavily pirated.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge number of users. Very few pay us. There is a huge opportunity for us in this space because we can get revenue from people we are not getting anything from,\u201d said Capossela, who did not elaborate on the effect the new service would have on Office\u2019s profit margins.\n\nIn the September quarter, Microsoft\u2019s Office business division was the biggest revenue and profit driver, outgaining even its bread-and-butter Windows unit.\n\nIn the previous fiscal year, the Office unit generated $18.9 billion in revenue and $12.4 billion in profit."
