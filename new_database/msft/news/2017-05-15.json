        "body": "WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Officials across the globe scrambled over the weekend to catch the culprits behind a massive ransomware worm that disrupted operations at car factories, hospitals, shops and schools, while Microsoft on Sunday pinned blame on the U.S. government for not disclosing more software vulnerabilities.\n\nCyber security experts said the spread of the worm dubbed WannaCry - \u201cransomware\u201d that locked up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries - had slowed but that the respite might only be brief amid fears new versions of the worm will strike.\n\nIn a blog post on Sunday, Microsoft President Brad Smith appeared to tacitly acknowledge what researchers had already widely concluded: The ransomware attack leveraged a hacking tool, built by the U.S. National Security Agency, that leaked online in April.\n\n\u201cThis is an emerging pattern in 2017,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cWe have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world.\u201d\n\nHe also poured fuel on a long-running debate over how government intelligence services should balance their desire to keep software flaws secret - in order to conduct espionage and cyber warfare - against sharing those flaws with technology companies to better secure the internet.\n\n\u201cThis attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem,\u201d Smith wrote. He added that governments around the world should \u201ctreat this attack as a wake-up call\u201d and \u201cconsider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\u201d\n\nThe NSA and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Microsoft statement.\n\nEconomic experts offered differing views on how much the attack, and associated computer outages, would cost businesses and governments.\n\nThe non-profit U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit research institute estimated that total losses would range in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but not exceed $1 billion.\n\nMost victims were quickly able to recover infected systems with backups, said the group\u2019s chief economist, Scott Borg.\n\nCalifornia-based cyber risk modeling firm Cyence put the total economic damage at $4 billion, citing costs associated with businesses interruption.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday night ordered his homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, to convene an \u201cemergency meeting\u201d to assess the threat posed by the global attack, a senior administration official told Reuters.\n\nSenior U.S. security officials held another meeting in the White House Situation Room on Saturday, and the FBI and the NSA were working to help mitigate damage and identify the perpetrators of the massive cyber attack, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe investigations into the attack were in the early stages, however, and attribution for cyber attacks is notoriously difficult.\n\nThe original attack lost momentum late on Friday after a security researcher took control of a server connected to the outbreak, which crippled a feature that caused the malware to rapidly spread across infected networks.\n\nInfected computers appear to largely be out-of-date devices that organizations deemed not worth the price of upgrading or, in some cases, machines involved in manufacturing or hospital functions that proved too difficult to patch without possibly disrupting crucial operations, security experts said.\n\nMicrosoft released patches last month and on Friday to fix a vulnerability that allowed the worm to spread across networks, a rare and powerful feature that caused infections to surge on Friday.\n\nCode for exploiting that bug, which is known as \u201cEternal Blue,\u201d was released on the internet last month by a hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers.\n\nThe head of the European Union police agency said on Sunday the cyber assault hit 200,000 victims in at least 150 countries and that number would grow when people return to work on Monday.\n\nMonday was expected to be a busy day, especially in Asia, which may not have seen the worst of the impact yet, as companies and organizations turned on their computers.\n\n\u201cExpect to hear a lot more about this tomorrow morning when users are back in their offices and might fall for phishing emails\u201d or other as yet unconfirmed ways the worm may propagate, said Christian Karam, a Singapore-based security researcher.\n\nThe attack hit organizations of all sizes.\n\nRenault said it halted manufacturing at plants in France and Romania to prevent the spread of ransomware.\n\nOther victims include is a Nissan manufacturing plant in Sunderland, northeast England, hundreds of hospitals and clinics in the British National Health Service, German rail operator Deutsche Bahn and international shipper FedEx Corp\n\nA Jakarta hospital said on Sunday that the cyber attack had infected 400 computers, disrupting the registration of patients and finding records.\n\nAccount addresses hard-coded into the malicious WannaCry virus appear to show the attackers had received just under $32,500 in anonymous bitcoin currency as of (1100 GMT) 7 a.m. EDT on Sunday, but that amount could rise as more victims rush to pay ransoms of $300 or more.\n\nThe threat receded over the weekend after a British-based researcher, who declined to give his name but tweets under the profile @MalwareTechBlog, said he stumbled on a way to at least temporarily limit the worm\u2019s spread by registering a web address to which he noticed the malware was trying to connect.\n\nSecurity experts said his move bought precious time for organizations seeking to block the attacks."
