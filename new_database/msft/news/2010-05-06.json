        "body": "Microsoft\u2019s decision to abandon Windows XP with its next browser is a business move meant to push people off the aged operating system, an analyst said today.\n\nIt also gives rivals like Mozilla an opportunity to make further inroads into Internet Explorer\u2019s market share, said Sheri McLeish of Forrester Research. \u201cXP is in that same world as Office 2003 and IE6,\u201d said McLeish. \u201cMicrosoft doesn\u2019t want to prolong the life of those products.\u201d\n\nMcLeish was reacting to Microsoft\u2019s stated plans not to support its next-generation browser, Internet Explorer 9 (IE9), in Windows XP. Google, which creates Chrome, criticized that decision yesterday during a panel discussion at Web 2.0 on the future of browsers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in [Microsoft\u2018s] interest to support XP,\u201d McLeish added. \u201cThey have a vision of moving people ahead on operating systems. That\u2019s their business intent.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft will not craft a version of IE9 for XP because it\u2019s adding graphics processor-based acceleration to the browser. That acceleration relies on APIs (applications programming interfaces) that are built into Windows 7 and were added to Vista in October 2009, but that are not available in the older OS.\n\nNoting that Microsoft will meet, and in fact exceed, its usual 10-year support policy for XP -- the operating system is slated for final retirement in April 2014, nearly 13 years after its release -- McLeish said IE9\u2019s non-support for the old OS was a business decision by Microsoft. \u201cAs time goes on, XP will get less attention paid to it by Microsoft,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also thought that the noise about XP\u2019s inability to run IE9 is a moot point for enterprises. \u201cThere are few large customers that don\u2019t have an upgrade plan [from XP] in place,\u201d she said. \u201cMost firms now running XP are planning to upgrade to Windows 7.\u201d IE9 runs on Windows 7.\n\nBut a window of opportunity exists for browser rivals, particularly Mozilla, over the next several years as small businesses and consumers continue to run Windows XP. Both Google and Mozilla are working on boosting their Chrome and Firefox browsers\u2019 by tapping into hardware acceleration, even on XP.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for them,\u201d said McLeish, referring to Mozilla. More enterprise administrators are telling her that they\u2019ve either allowed Firefox on their networks, or are considering the idea. \u201cAs they\u2019re moving off IE6, they\u2019re looking at Mozilla and Firefox.\u201d\n\nChrome, on the other hand, has little traction in corporations, although Google\u2019s browser continues to outpace all other browsers in usage share gains . Google\u2019s browser will get little respect from IT administrators, partly because of the battles between Microsoft and Google in the fight over online applications, said McLeish.\n\nMicrosoft has said it will not officially support Chrome or Opera Software\u2019s Opera for the online versions of its Office 2010 applications, for example, which means enterprises committed to Office 2010, and that offer workers the Web-based versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, have little reason to allow Chrome into their environments.\n\nSome pundits worry that IE9\u2019s exclusion of XP leaves millions of users out in the cold when it comes to HTML5, the still-under-consideration specification for the next version of the Web\u2019s primary development framework.\n\nMicrosoft has been hammering on the benefits of HTML5, and its support within IE9, with the company\u2019s IE chief Dean Hachamovitch at the forefront.\n\nMcLeish didn\u2019t see any reason for XP users to immediately panic; there\u2019s plenty of time before HTML5 supplants Flash, if it ever does. \u201cThere\u2019s a real tension between Adobe and Apple on Flash versus HTLM5,\u201d she said, talking about the public mud-slinging going on between those two firms. \u201cBut Microsoft would like to play in both worlds, Flash and HTML5.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Hachamovitch said as much earlier this week on the IE blog . \u201cOf course, IE9 will continue to support Flash and other plug-ins,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fully expect to support plug-ins (of all types, including video) along with HTML5.\u201d\n\nIE9 is currently in what Microsoft\u2019s called \u201cPlatform Preview,\u201d a pre-alpha stage that lacks a user interface wrapper around the technology. Microsoft hasn\u2019t revealed a schedule for releasing a public beta, much less a final.\n\nBased on Microsoft\u2019s past IE development cycles, McLeish believes IE9 could be as far away as a year. \u201cI think they\u2019re ahead of schedule, but there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s unclear,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2018m thinking a year from now we\u2019ll see a final [of IE9].\u201d\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

        "body": "Microsoft silently patched three vulnerabilities last month, two of them affecting enterprise mission-critical Exchange mail servers, without calling out the bugs in the accompanying advisories, a security expert said today.\n\nTwo of the three unannounced vulnerabilities, and the most serious of the trio, were packaged with MS10-024 , an update to Exchange and Windows SMTP Service that Microsoft issued April 13 and tagged as \u201cimportant,\u201d its second-highest threat ranking.\n\nAccording to Ivan Arce, the chief technology officer of Core Security Technologies, Microsoft patched the bugs, but failed to disclose that it had done so.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more important than the [two vulnerabilities] that Microsoft did disclose,\u201d said Arce. \u201cThat means [system] administrators may end up making the wrong decisions about applying the update. They need that information to assess the risk.\u201d\n\nCore Labs researcher Nicolas Economou discovered the two unspoken bugs while digging into the update, part of his jobs as an exploit writer for Core, which is best known for its Core Impact penetration testing framework, a system for probing computers and networks for potential vulnerabilities by attacking them with real-world exploits.\n\n\u201cAn attacker may leverage the two previously undisclosed vulnerabilities fixed by MS10-024 to spoof responses to any DNS query sent by the Windows SMTP service trivially,\u201d said Core in its own advisory on Economou\u2019s discovery. \u201cDNS response spoofing and cache poisoning attacks are well known to have a variety of security implications with impact beyond just Denial of Service and Information Disclosure as originally stated in MS10-024.\u201d\n\nDNS cache poisoning is a long-standing attack tactic -- it goes back nearly two decades -- but is probably best known for the critical vulnerability in the Internet\u2019s Domain Name System (DNS) software found by Dan Kaminsky in 2008.\n\nSecret patches are neither new or rare. \u201cThis has been going on for many years and the action in and of itself is not a huge conspiracy,\u201d said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security.\n\nWhat is unusual is that Core took Microsoft\u2019s silent updates public.\n\nSaying that Microsoft \u201cmisrepresented\u201d and \u201cunderestimated\u201d the criticality of MS10-024 because it didn\u2019t reveal the two bugs, Core urged company administrators to \u201cconsider re-assessing patch deployment priorities.\u201d\n\nCore found a third unstated April 13 fix in another update, MS10-028 . That patch addressed two identified bugs in Microsoft Visio, the company\u2019s project diagramming software.\n\nMicrosoft acknowledged it had fixed flaws without telling customers, but defended the practice.\n\n\u201cWhen a security vulnerability is discovered, Microsoft conducts a thorough investigation of that vulnerability, addresses any other issues found in the code as a result of that investigation and subjects the security updates to extensive testing for quality assurance,\u201d said Jerry Bryant, a security program manager, in an e-mail. \u201cThis helps reduce the number of updates customers have to deploy, since updating can be disruptive to customer environments.\u201d\n\nIf an internally-discovered flaw requires separate action or guidance not already covered by other vulnerabilities in the bulletin, \u201cwe would definitely document and address that vulnerability separately,\u201d Bryant said.\n\nThe truth is that it\u2019s business as usual for not just Microsoft, but for most software makers, said Storms. \u201cVendors commonly find bugs themselves in released code and will distribute the fixes inside a bundle of other patches,\u201d he noted. \u201cMany times there simply is no benefit to anyone to disclose the bug.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Microsoft\u2019s policy is to not assign CVEs -- the bug identifiers logged into the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database -- to flaws found by its own researchers, said Storms. \u201cThere is no requirement for a vendor to request a CVE for internal bugs,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Storms also echoed Arce\u2019s concern about possible misuse of the practice, which could result in a false sense of security among users. \u201cWhat\u2019s in question here is if the vendor misrepresents the risk and thus creates a false sense of lethargy with respect to the priority of patch distribution,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, if an IE8 patch rated \u2018moderate\u2019 by Microsoft actually also contained a critical internally-found bug, would the lower rating put customers at risk because they may feel they could delay patch distribution, all along having no idea there was a hidden critical patch?\u201d\n\nArce argued that that was exactly what Microsoft did in the case of MS10-024. \u201cThey fixed a very similar vulnerability in MS08-037 two years ago,\u201d he said, talking about the critical 2008 patch to plug the DNS vulnerabilities Kaminsky discovered . \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t a vulnerability then, why did they issue a vulnerability bulletin?\u201d asked Arce. \u201cThere\u2019s no reasonable way for them to say this isn\u2019t a security problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no easy answer for the vendor or customer,\u201d Storms said. \u201cIf the vendor distributed a critical patch, but with little information, like Adobe for example, we would all be hammering on the vendor for more information. On the other hand, given the workload on enterprise security teams we need to trust the vendor\u2019s rating to help determine priority.\u201d\n\nCore\u2019s advisories on the silent patching of MS10-024 and MS10-028 are available on its Web site.\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

        "body": "Microsoft came under fire from some of its rivals on Wednesday for its decision not to offer Internet Explorer 9 -- and hence support for the upcoming HTML 5 standard -- to users of its older Windows XP operating system.\n\nMicrosoft said at its MIX developer conference in March that IE 9 won\u2019t be offered for XP. The reason, technical evangelist Giorgio Sardo said at the Web 2.0 Expo on Wednesday, is that IE 9 is a \u201cmodern browser,\u201d and getting the benefits of the hardware acceleration and other performance gains that it will offer requires a \u201cmodern OS.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with Alex Russell, a member of Google\u2019s Chrome browser development team. \u201cOpera and Mozilla are also hardware-accelerating their browsers, and all of us are doing it on XP,\u201d said Russell, who joined Sardo and representatives from Mozilla, Opera and Yahoo for a panel discussion on the future of Web browsers.\n\n\u201cYou describe a world where users are getting left behind,\u201d Russell said.\n\n\u201cI reckon this is a problem,\u201d agreed Doug Crockford, a senior JavaScript architect at Yahoo. \u201cI recommend all users of XP migrate to another browser that\u2019s not IE.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the adoption of HTML 5, an upcoming revamp of the Web\u2019s markup language that will add significant new capabilities, including standard ways to implement video, animation, audio and offline storage, that are not included in the current HTML standard.\n\nIt\u2019s important partly because it should help to reduce fragmentation on the Web, which forces developers to build and test applications for multiple browsers or use proprietary technologies such as Flash and Silverlight.\n\nBut if IE 9, which will be Microsoft\u2019s first browser to fully support HTML 5, isn\u2019t available for XP, then those users will be outside of that HTML 5 compatibility sphere. And IE 6 still has more users than the Opera, Chrome and Safari browsers combined, according to Crockford. In some countries it accounts for as much as 40 percent of browser usage, he said.\n\nThe panelists were largely complementary of IE 6. When it appeared in 2001, Russell said, \u201cIE 6 was fantastic. It set the pace for JavaScript, DOM, the component model, things we\u2019re still making use of today.\u201d One reason it is still hanging around, said Mozilla\u2019s Brendan Eich, is that many enterprises created macros and other extensions on top of it.\n\nBut Dion Almaer of Palm, who moderated the panel, said it has become \u201can anchor around our necks.\u201d\n\nAs Crockford sees it, the W3C \u201cabandoned its role as the stewards of the Web\u201d at the start of the decade, allowing incompatible technologies to flourish. There is now a fresh burst of standards activity around HTML 5. \u201cWhich is great,\u201d Crockford said, \u201cbut it\u2019s all irrelevant if we don\u2019t solve the IE 6 problem.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft believes HTML 5 is \u201cthe future,\u201d Sardo said. It has implemented parts of the standard -- which is not yet complete -- in IE 8, and will fully support it with IE 9. Microsoft released its second developer preview of IE 9 on Wednesday morning, he said, though he didn\u2019t say when the final product will ship.\n\nHe also said Microsoft tries hard to keep people\u2019s browser software up to date. For example, it allows PCs to download browser updates even if the copy of Windows is unlicensed. This is especially important in China, where a lot of software in use is pirated.\n\n\u201cOne of the main challenges at Microsoft is the complexity of adopting a new spec,\u201d Sardo said. HTML 5 is \u201ca great spec and it will lead to a great future for developers, but it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Ensuring the implementation is the same across all browsers involves \u201ca lot of work to test and validate.\u201d\n\nEich said Mozilla has \u201cgot a lot of HTML 5 already implemented, even though it\u2019s a moving target.\u201d\n\nCrockford proposed a radical solution to get all the Web\u2019s users onto a current browser: On an agreed-upon day, all developers would deny access to their Web sites unless the visitor\u2019s browser is up to date.\n\n\u201cOn one day, all of us will say, you have to download one of these five or six browsers,\u201d he said. \u201cI propose that day is 30 days after all the major browser vendors have implemented HTML 5. On that day, IE 6 dies.\u201d\n\nIt may not have been a very practical idea, but it earned him a round of applause from the developers watching the discussion."

        "body": "Microsoft today said it would patch two critical vulnerabilities with two updates to Windows and Office next week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the predictable off month for Microsoft,\u201d said Andrew Storms, the director of security operations with nCircle Security. \u201cThat\u2019s all within the predictable pattern they\u2019ve created.\u201d\n\nStorms was referring to Microsoft\u2019s habit of alternating large- and small-sized updates. In April, the company issued 11 security updates that fixed a total of 25 flaws , including nine tagged as \u201ccritical,\u201d the highest threat ranking in its four-step scoring system.\n\nIn its monthly advance notification , Microsoft spelled out next week\u2019s single-digit Patch Tuesday.\n\nThe one-patch Windows update is labeled critical for Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Server 2003 and Server 2008, and as \u201cimportant\u201d for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2. According to Microsoft, the newest operating systems -- Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 -- will be patched even though they\u2019re not vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWindows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 customers will be offered the Windows-related update but they are not vulnerable in their default configurations,\u201d said Jerry Bryant, a security program manager, in an entry on the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) blog.\n\nMicrosoft did the same last month when it patched the VBScript scripting engine in Windows; although Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 were not vulnerable, Microsoft updated the code just in case. The company slaps a \u201cdefense-in-depth\u201d label on such fixes.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is the vulnerable code exists in Windows 7 and 2008 R2,\u201d said Storms, \u201cbut that they also don\u2019t know what people might figure out in the future as a way to exploit it. The bug exists, but they\u2019re making the distinction that at the moment no one can think of a way to use it.\u201d\n\nThat could change down the road, Storms said, pointing out Microsoft\u2019s DEP (data execution prevention) and ASLR (address space layout randomization) defenses as examples. \u201cThey were viewed as a giant leap forward [when they were introduced], but that leap is starting to erode, and fast,\u201d he said.\n\nWork on ways to bypass DEP and ASLR has stepped up of late. In March, two researchers sidestepped both defenses to win $10,000 each at the high-profile Pwn2Own hacking contest . Microsoft quickly stood up for the features, saying that although DEP and ASLR weren\u2019t \u201cdesigned to prevent every attack forever,\u201d they remained effective in raising the attack bar.\n\nTuesday\u2019s second update will patch Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007, as well as the Visual Basic for Applications and Visual Basic for Applications SDK (software developers kit) tools.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m betting that the vulnerability will be in the Office 2007 converter tool,\u201d said Storms, talking about the file conversion utility Microsoft offers that lets users open documents in the newer Office 2007 formats in older editions of the suite.\n\nMicrosoft will not issue fixes next week for flaws it has publicly acknowledged in both SharePoint 2007 and Internet Explorer. \u201cWe will not be releasing an update for [our recent Security Advisory for SharePoint] with the May bulletins,\u201d confirmed Microsoft\u2019s Bryant. \u201cOur teams are still working on an update for that issue.\u201d\n\nThe SharePoint zero-day bug, which was disclosed last week by a Swiss security consultancy, could be used by attackers to steal confidential information from companies\u2019 SharePoint servers. Microsoft has recommended that administrators apply a workaround in lieu of a patch.\n\nThe unpatched vulnerability in IE was confirmed by Microsoft in early February after a researcher with Core Security Technologies showed how the bug could be exploited to remotely read files on a PC\u2019s local drive. The vulnerability affects all versions of the company\u2019s browser, including IE8.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a low-risk bug,\u201d argued Storms, when asked why Microsoft had not yet patched it. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an odd situation, and probably doesn\u2019t represent a big risk at the moment.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft will release the two updates at approximately 1 p.m. ET on May 9.\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .
