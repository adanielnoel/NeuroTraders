They argued that turning them over would jeopardize the future of international cloud computing.\n\nThe case has taken on urgency for tech and media companies in the wake of revelations about bulk electronic data collection by the U.S. National Security Agency from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nTechnology companies including and AT&T Inc and even rival Apple Inc also filed briefs supporting Microsoft\u2019s bid to fend off a government search warrant for the emails.\n\nMicrosoft began fighting the warrant in 2013, saying that U.S. prosecutors were overreaching by demanding data held in a foreign country without the assistance of local authorities.\n\nIt is not known whose emails are sought, but prosecutors said they wanted them for a drug investigation.\n\nThe prosecutors said their demand did not violate Irish sovereignty because Microsoft\u2019s U.S. employees had control of the emails and could retrieve them without going to Ireland. In July, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska agreed and ordered Microsoft to comply.\n\nThe ruling could wreak havoc in cloud computing for both businesses and individuals if countries regularly begin to claim authority over data stored elsewhere, said Andrew Pincus, a lawyer who filed a brief for groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business lobby.\n\nBusinesses want to be sure their legal records, intellectual property and merger plans are generally private from authorities worldwide, Pincus said.\n\n\u201cIf by putting them in the cloud, you lose control over them and the government just gets access whenever it wants, nobody\u2019s going to do that,\u201d Pincus said at a conference at Microsoft\u2019s New York office.\n\nThe security of data centers is critical to journalists, said Bruce Brown, executive director of the U.S.-based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\n\n\u201cWe have stuff governments around the world want,\u201d Brown said at the conference.\n\nOthers supporting Microsoft in court briefs included the American Civil Liberties Union and 35 computer science and engineering professors.\n\nA ruling by the appeals court is likely months away. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Monday.\n\nThe case is Microsoft v. U.S., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2985."
