        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Sales of Microsoft Corp\u2019s Windows software fell short of outsized expectations, rekindling fears that the spread of mobile gadgets will erode its main PC-focused business.\n\nMicrosoft surprised Wall Street with a better-than-expected profit, helped by resurgent corporate spending after the belt-tightening of past years. But its shares stayed flat as investors expressed concern about the weakness of overall computer sales amid a faltering U.S. recovery.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software maker, whose Windows operating system runs on 90 percent of the world\u2019s computers, is heavily dependent on PC sales, which grew only 3 percent in the quarter. Now it is starting to feel the heat from investors eyeing the phenomenal take-up of Apple Inc\u2019s iPad.\n\n\u201cOutstanding numbers when you take a first look at it, but when you delve into them, Windows missed expectations by $300 million,\u201d said Brendan Barnicle, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.\n\nSales of smartphones and tablets are expected to grow much more quickly than PCs over the next few years, posing a threat to Microsoft\u2019s key market.\n\nWith the migration to mobile devices from desktop computers expected to accelerate, Apple overtook Microsoft to become the largest U.S. technology company by market value last May.\n\nBut some analysts argued that fears of tablets and other hot-selling gadgets replacing PCs were overblown -- at least for now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten over 300 million Windows 7 licenses sold. I mean, PCs are not disappearing. Put that into perspective with 7 million tablets sold last quarter from Apple,\u201d said BGC Financial\u2019s Colin Gillis.\n\n\u201cClearly there are disruptions in the landscape, but some of the negative viewpoints are overblown.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft stock is down about 3 percent over the past 12 months, compared with a 24 percent gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Apple shares are up 65 percent over the same period.\n\nThe results surprised the market after being discovered online by data search firm Selerity, which posted profit and revenue numbers on Twitter at 2:50 p.m. EST.\n\nTrading in Microsoft\u2019s shares spiked just under an hour later, after blogs and news agencies started reporting the earnings from the web page discovered by Selerity, sending the shares up as much as 2 percent to $29.46. They ebbed back to $28.87 at the close, a 0.3 percent gain for the day. They drifted slightly lower in after-hours trading.\n\n\u201cA preproduction draft of our earnings release was discovered by one or more media sources who then published our results to the web before market close,\u201d said a Microsoft spokesman, who apologized for any confusion and said the company was reviewing procedures to make sure it does not happen again.\n\nThough Microsoft faces longer-term challenges in the PC arena, its other core product, its suite of Office applications, generates strong cash flow.\n\nSales at its Office unit rose 24 percent to $6 billion, indicating that U.S. businesses are starting to spend more on technology after the recession.\n\nBut consumers are proving less resilient. U.S. initial jobless claims surged in the latest week to their highest since October, indicating that any recovery in consumer spending will come only in fits and starts.\n\nSales for its Windows unit fell 30 percent to $5.054 billion, a little short of analysts\u2019 expectations of about $5.3 billion, due to the lukewarm growth in PC sales. The year-ago figure was swollen by $1.71 billion in deferred revenue and pre-sales from the launch of Windows 7.\n\nThe perennially money-losing online services division, home of the Bing search engine, posted a 19 percent increase in sales, but saw its loss widen 17 percent to $543 million. The unit, which is making only slight headway against Google Inc, has lost more than $6 billion in the last five years.\n\nUnearned revenue -- a measure of the strength of the business in Microsoft\u2019s pipeline -- fell 9.5 percent to $13.4 billion, a cause of concern to some investors.\n\nMicrosoft reported overall fiscal second-quarter profit of $6.63 billion, or 77 cents per share, compared with $6.66 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. The per share figure was higher due to a reduction in shares outstanding from last year.\n\nWall Street was expecting 68 cents per share profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nSales rose 5 percent to $19.95 billion, helped by strong sales of its Kinect hands-free gaming system and Xbox consoles, handily beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $19.15 billion.\n\n\u201dKinect represents the most legitimate opportunity we have seen for the Xbox to drive some profit. I do think there is a meaningful catalyst there,\u201c said Motley Fool senior analyst Tim Beyers. \u201dThe Windows phone looks good. I do think that Windows Phone 7 is proving to be an interesting alternative to the Blackberry.\n\n\u201cI guess the nut of it is, Microsoft is starting to do something better and they are not tripping on themselves, and that counts for something.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft now has $41.2 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said he was happy with the cash it is distributing to shareholders, holding out little hope of a dividend hike, which some investors would like to see."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp shares fell more than 4 percent to a six-week low on Friday, dragging down much of the tech sector, as investors fretted about the strength of the company\u2019s core Windows franchise and the broader threat to personal computers from tablets.\n\nShares in PC-focused companies such as Intel Corp, IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc also fell in a lower market, in the face of decelerating PC sales.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many other more appealing growth opportunities out there,\u201d said Channing Smith, a co-manager at Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which sold its Microsoft holdings last summer. \u201cOur focus is growth in mobile Internet. Frankly, Microsoft is not a major player there.\u201d\n\nAlthough Windows 7 sales are still strong -- it has now sold more than 300 million licenses for its new operating system since launch in October 2009 -- a shortfall in sales against analysts\u2019 expectations in the last quarter has prompted fears that consumers\u2019 limited buying strength will be directed to smartphones and tablets.\n\nThose markets, led by Apple Inc\u2019s iPad and devices running Google Inc\u2019s Android system, are growing at a faster pace than PC sales and look set to eat away at Microsoft\u2019s key market.\n\n\u201cTablet demand is likely to weigh on consumer Windows sales, as we expect the iPad version 2 and new Android devices in the coming months,\u201d said Wells Fargo Securities analyst Jason Maynard in a research note on Friday.\n\nMicrosoft has tended to downplay the importance of tablets, but Chief Financial Officer acknowledged that their popularity has started to affect PC sales, especially as a replacement for netbooks -- small PCs mostly running Windows. Netbook sales peaked last year.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is, over the course of this year in the consumer space, some of that (netbook) volume being replaced with newer devices like ultra-portables and tablets,\u201d Klein said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday. \u201cLargely, these are second devices, not primary devices. And that\u2019s caused a little bit of a drag on the consumer side.\u201d\n\nEven though Microsoft beat earnings and sales forecasts, investors were cool on its quarterly numbers because of a shortfall in Windows sales and signs that spending by both business and consumers is not as strong as some had hoped.\n\n\u201cDeferred revenue is where you go to look for the business demand and it wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said Jane Snorek, technology analyst at First American Funds. \u201cThat\u2019s very strange considering a lot of companies like IBM, SAP and Oracle had very nice budget flushes. I think that was a shock.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s deferral of unearned revenue in the quarter -- a measure of the strength of the business in its pipeline -- fell 1.3 percent to $6.8 billion. Overall, Microsoft\u2019s unearned revenue fell 9.5 percent to $13.4 billion.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said concerns regarding tablets will \u201chang over Microsoft like a dark cloud\u201d and wondered \u201cif the slew of new Android tablets expected to flood the market in the June quarter will make recently reduced PC unit shipments too optimistic.\u201d\n\nFBR was skeptical about a strong enterprise PC refresh cycle and expected tablets to impact Microsoft\u2019s core desktop franchise.\n\nBofA Merrill differed, saying that while the threat from Apple and concerns on Microsoft\u2019s long-term growth are valid, the company\u2019s enterprise business can drive growth through upgrade and refresh cycles.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent bounce in (Microsoft) stock, the market discounts almost zero terminal growth, which is unwarranted,\u201d it added.\n\nJean-Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft International, told Reuters that \u201cdevices are going to go and come\u201d and that the company was making progress in developing products in the tablet arena.\n\nDespite rising about 13 percent over the past six weeks up to Thursday\u2019s close, Microsoft shares are still down 7 percent over the past year, compared with a 21 percent rise in the Nasdaq. The shares are now trading at about 11 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, a 40 percent discount to the 10-year median of 18.5, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.\n\nShares in Microsoft were down $1.17, or 4.1 percent, at $27.70 in late afternoon trade on Nasdaq. The stock hit a session low of $27.45, its lowest since mid-December."

Its shares fell almost 10 percent. [ID:nN27148561]\n\n\u201dAmazon is a disciplined company, they\u2019re long-term focused. The spending that they\u2019re doing reflects the strength of their growth.\n\n\u201dTopline still seems to be really strong, but to meet this demand they\u2019re having to invest in fulfillment and distribution and that\u2019s taking a little bit of a short-term margin toll.\n\n\u201dYes, Amazon\u2019s pulling back based on this, but this doesn\u2019t affect the long-term story at all. If you believe in the story and can see the upside that they have, they\u2019re doing the right things to meet that demand.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the size of the opportunity, and how relatively under-penetrated e-commerce still is, and the opportunity ahead of Amazon to basically gain share, they\u2019re making the right decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon discussed on its prior two calls its need to invest in its fulfillment and distribution and this is consistent with that. But I think people were expecting kind of a blowout when they looked at data points that suggested that e-commerce spending potentially had the strongest quarter in three years.\u201d\n\n\u201dOperating income (guidance) for the first quarter is well below the consensus and the stock is taking a big hit. It could be that they\u2019re back to spending mode.\n\n\u201dExpectations were high here, and the stock ran up today.\n\n\u201cThe slight miss on revenue for the fourth quarter is noise. They\u2019re going to have to explain what the operating income (forecast) miss is. That\u2019s a decline from the first quarter of last year and well below expectations. I\u2018m very curious what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nHe said operating income expectations had been for around $274 million.\n\n\u201dLooks like it was disappointing on the top line number. Operating margins improved slightly but not as much I was expecting. Seems like it was a competitive holiday season.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of expectations the revenue number would be $13 billion and that just didn\u2019t happen. And going forward, it\u2019s going to be the revenue number and sustainable operating margins that what will dictate the share price.\u201d\n\n\u201dI really think that Kinect represents the most legitimate opportunity we have seen for the Xbox to drive some profit. I do think there is a meaningful catalyst there.\n\n\u201dWhen I looked at Steve Ballmer at CES, none of it was terribly groundbreaking. It was the opposite of an Apple event.\n\n\u201dBut the Windows phone looks good. I do think that Windows phone 7 is proving to be an interesting alternative to the Blackberry.\n\n\u201cI guess the nut of it is, Microsoft is starting to do something better and they are not tripping on themselves and that counts for something.\u201d\n\n\u201dOutstanding numbers when you take a first look at it but when you delve into them, Windows missed expectations by $300 million.\n\n\u201cThe big surprise is huge strength in the Office business, $600 million above expectations. That is really being driven by the Office 10 release.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis company has got some momentum behind it. The core businesses have been setting records. They\u2019ve got a nice, tight focus on their core marketplaces. They\u2019ve got discipline in terms of cost controls and driving earnings. They\u2019re the best in the space in terms of returning cash to shareholders.\n\n\u201cBasically, we\u2019ve gotten over 300 million Windows 7 licenses sold. I mean, PCs are not disappearing. Put that into perspective with 7 million tablets sold last quarter from Apple. Clearly there are disruptions in the landscape, but some of the negative viewpoints are overblown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems like there is strength across the board. I think it\u2019s fair to say the Windows division numbers were light. The weakness in the consumer PC market has been widely known.\u201d"
