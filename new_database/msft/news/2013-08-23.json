        "body": "SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steve Ballmer, a passionate salesman who has been a central figure at Microsoft Corp for more than three decades, unexpectedly announced his retirement as chief executive on Friday, ending a controversial 13-year reign in which the world\u2019s largest software company lost its position as the dominant force in computing.\n\nThe surprise move sent the company\u2019s share price up 7 percent, reflecting a widespread view that Ballmer is not the man to reverse the fortunes of a company that remains highly profitable but has failed to navigate the transition to the mobile computing era.\n\nBallmer\u2019s planned exit comes just weeks after the company announced a major reorganization and delivered an earnings report that showed across-the-board weakness in the business, including dismal sales of the company\u2019s new Surface tablet and a lukewarm reaction to the crucial Windows 8 operating system.\n\nMicrosoft said it had engaged the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles and would consider both internal and external candidates to succeed Ballmer - underscoring the lack of a succession plan at a company where many talented executives have been squeezed out over the years. Ballmer will stay on for up to a year until a new CEO is found.\n\nA close friend and confidant of co-founder Bill Gates since the company\u2019s earliest days, the 57-year-old Ballmer formally notified the company two days ago of his intention to retire, according to a regulatory filing. In an interview with the trade publication ZD Net, director John Thompson said the search for a successor had in fact been underway for some time.\n\n\u201cWe are well down the path in the search,\u201d said Thomson, who is leading a search committee that also includes Gates.\n\nStill, the timing of the announcement and the lack of a succession plan suggest the recent setbacks may have spurred the company\u2019s board to act. Gates remains chairman of the board, which has historically followed his lead.\n\nBallmer himself acknowledged his decision was abrupt.\n\n\u201cThere is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,\u201d he wrote in a memo to employees. \u201cThis is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.\u201d\n\nBallmer has faced criticism from investors for years as rivals led by Apple Inc and Google Inc came to dominate huge new markets in smartphones, tablets, Internet search and cloud computing even as Microsoft remained reliant on the traditional personal computer.\n\nActivist investing fund ValueAct Capital Management LP said in April that it had taken a stake in the company and shortly after began agitating for a change in strategy and a clear CEO succession plan.\n\nMicrosoft, like Apple, has been under pressure from shareholders to hand back more of its cash hoard, which now totals $77 billion.\n\n\u201cThis might accelerate more shareholder-friendly capital returns of that cash treasure trove, which would help in the revaluation of the stock to more appropriate levels,\u201d said Todd Lowenstein at fund firm HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.\n\nThere are no obvious candidates to succeed Ballmer at a company that has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history. Ballmer had once indicated that he intended to stay at least until 2017.\n\nBallmer can claim some important successes: revenue tripled during his tenure, profits doubled, and the company scored a big success with the Xbox videogame business. The Windows and Office franchises remain highly profitable, and Microsoft is well-entrenched as a vendor of corporate computing products and services.\n\nAt the same time, though, repeated forays into mobile phones, tablets and music players have come to grief. The Surface tablet, aimed at the hugely successful iPad, alienated longtime hardware partners even as it failed to generate significant sales, and a phone partnership with Nokia has thus far yielded little for either company.\n\nAt the same time, the company has lost billions trying to compete with Google in the Internet search business. Some of Microsoft\u2019s corporate computing businesses are also under threat from the industry-wide transition to cloud-based services.\n\nThe recent reorganization was aimed at reshaping Microsoft - once primarily a purveyor of packaged software - into a company focused on devices and services, essentially mimicking Apple.\n\nYet most industry watchers felt it was too little, too late, with some calling on the company to back away from the consumer products sector and focus on serving businesses.\n\nIn the ZD Net interview, Ballmer rejected that approach. \u201cNobody has ever managed to figure out how to build a device for a user that was just enterprise or just consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cThese core experiences do span \u2018consumer and enterprise.'\u201d\n\nBallmer, a forceful, often emotional leader, was regarded a great salesman rather than a brilliant technologist.\n\nA physically imposing presence with a booming voice, his motivational efforts were the stuff of legend: a clip of a semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing around the stage to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed nearly five million times on YouTube.\n\nYet the antics sometimes acquired an air of desperation as Apple and other rivals produced industry-changing innovations that Microsoft couldn\u2019t match.\n\n\u201cThat is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn\u2019t appeal to business customers,\u201d Ballmer laughed in a TV interview after the launch of Apple\u2019s iPhone in 2007. Five years later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nA Michigan native, Ballmer studied applied mathematics and economics at Harvard, where he met Gates. Several years later Gates persuaded him to drop out of Stanford Business School to become Microsoft\u2019s first commercial manager and the company\u2019s 30th employee.\n\nTo induce him, Gates offered Ballmer part ownership of the company, and when Microsoft incorporated a year later, Ballmer had almost an 8 percent stake. That formed the foundation of his wealth which is now valued at $15 billion by Forbes magazine.\n\nBallmer remains one of the largest holders of Microsoft stock, with about four percent of the company. His net worth, ironically, soared by nearly a billion dollars on Friday as the stock market celebrated his departure.\n\nMicrosoft shares closed up 7.3 percent at $34.75 on Nasdaq on Friday."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer would retire within the next 12 months, once it has selected a successor, sending its shares up in early trading.\n\nThe following is reaction from analysts to the move.\n\n\u201dTo be successful in a technology company, first and foremost, you need to earn the respect of software developers and engineers. And Ballmer failed to do that in the past 15 years.\n\n\u201dBallmer should have left Microsoft at least 8 years back.\n\n\u201cNever buy the argument \u2018we have 100,000 people in the company there is a huge depth of management talent.'\u201d\n\n\u201dThere more 100,000 in Dell, HP, Apple, and has there been any executive close to the likes of Gates or Jobs?\n\n\u201dA good CEO would be Vic Gundotra at Google. He left Microsoft for Google. He has the most respect of the engineers and developers both at Microsoft and Google. Vic is probably the only executive, who can bring the much-needed fresh perspective to Microsoft, while still having a deep understanding of Microsoft Culture.\n\n\u201cHe is a perfect blend of being a Microsoft Insider and bringing a fresh perspective from Google.\u201d\n\n\u201dA change is definitely needed. Since he took over in 2000, it is fair to say he missed a number of transitions: mobile, tablets, cloud. And Microsoft was very slow with virtualization, it has no place in the software defined data center\n\n\u201dMicrosoft continues to live off traditional PC computing. Ballmer\u2019s strength is traditional PC computing. He was a great guy for his era but times have changed and a new leadership is needed. It\u2019s hard to say his tenure has been a success.\n\n\u201dI\u2019d like to see them get a more forward thinking person who grasps hold of the current trends, thinks mobile first and cloud first. It\u2019s hard to be a company that deals in corporate and consumer technology. Rarely has that ever worked.\n\n\u201cClearly the way it\u2019s structured is not been working.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that\u2019s what happening with the company, change is positive. The stock is up but the pop is fading. If you\u2019re buying this for the CEO change, you could have a long hard 12 months in front of you. They are going to do a massive reorg. You tend to do these things if things are not getting better.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s the end of the fiscal year for them. You had two of the worst declines in the PC in the PC marketplace There are significant cracks in the entire ecosystem.\n\n\u201dThere\u2019s changes happening at every level, happening at every level underneath him. It\u2019s very reasonable for the board and CEO to sit down and have a discussion about what we are doing here.\n\n\u201cI think the numbers sway the board. The PC market peaked in the absolute sense in September 2011. The No. 1 PC maker sold more smartphones than PCs last quarter - Lenovo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a surprise, especially considering how close it is to the recently announced strategic overhaul towards devices and services.\u201d\n\n\u201dI\u2018m surprised. My first gut reaction is that it came out of the activist investor effort Value Act. The timing seems very odd.\n\nRegarding the stock rise on the news: \u201dThat\u2019s a real buzz fill for him. It\u2019s not ego boost.\n\n\u201dAs much as people would like to blame Steve Ballmer for the fortunes of the company, I think it\u2019s the silos. I thought they had great products, but they should have worked better together and leveraged common foundations. Maybe that is his problem that they did it that way. But Ray Ozzie had been brought in to span across the products and that kind of flopped.\n\nRegarding succession: \u201cLooking across the next level of executives, there\u2019s a lot of candidates. I would be super surprised if they picked an outside talent.\u201d\n\n\u201dThere are two aspects to this, the stock price and how the company has actually done. The stock price has been more or less flat since Ballmer\u2019s tenure. The board\u2019s going to look at that and say we need someone to change that.\n\n\u201dWhere Ballmer has been correctly faulted for is the performance of Windows. Like Dell, HP and other PC makers they with Microsoft have been caught flatfooted by the shift to tablets.\n\n\u201dOne can argue that Ballmer as CEO was in part responsible for that failure. Then again it is a broad, systematic one. Though Microsoft has been doing better than others (in dealing with the PC decline), where Ballmer does not get sufficient credit for is the other divisions. Servers, xBox, Bing products in general have shown some success. The problem for Microsoft is its revenue primarily comes from sales to business. It should be viewed more like IBM, but is viewed as consumer like Apple.\n\n\u201cAccording to our estimates about 2/3 of revenue come from sales to business.\u201d\n\nRegarding succession: \u201cYou obviously want someone who knows the business well and understands both divisions of business and consumer. You also want someone who would be bold enough to split the company, split off windows, run that as one business and keep the other part as a separate business. That\u2019s one way a bold CEO could come in and say we are being penalized by being compared to Apple. That\u2019s going to be a tough sale especially with Bill Gates as overhead.\u201d"

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Few CEOs wielded more power than Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer.\n\nAnd yet the company\u2019s first and foremost salesman never gained the respect he deserved for his role in transforming Bill Gates\u2019 tiny startup in the woods outside Seattle into the world\u2019s largest software maker.\n\nBallmer, who announced his retirement from the head of Microsoft Corp on Friday, had the misfortune to follow megastar Gates at the helm just as the company hit the end of its explosive growth period and faced a resurgent Apple Inc under an inspired Steve Jobs.\n\nThe Detroit native, who met Gates at Harvard, was doubly unfortunate that his ascent to the CEO office in January 2000 came just weeks before the bursting of the dot.com stock bubble, from which Microsoft\u2019s share price never recovered.\n\nAlthough Ballmer did treble revenues at Microsoft during his time in charge, and managed to steer the company away from obscurity or crisis that befell other tech firms, he consistently attracted criticism for management miscues.\n\nUnder his watch, Apple and Google Inc roared past Microsoft in the emerging arena of Internet search, smartphones and tablets, which made the software company look stodgy and behind-the-times.\n\n\u201cHe tried hard. Nobody can doubt his commitment to Microsoft,\u201d said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. \u201cThe missing element was execution.\u201d\n\nHis attempt to catch up was a failed $47 billion bid for fading internet giant Yahoo Inc in 2008, a company which is now worth much less. Yahoo\u2019s inexplicable decision to reject the deal probably saved Ballmer\u2019s job.\n\nOnly last month, Ballmer launched a massive reorganization of Microsoft in an attempt to transform it into a \u2018devices and services\u2019 company, but it left most shareholders unimpressed.\n\nBallmer never lacked passion and energy for the company he helped to build, but he was always more of a salesman and cheerleader than a technology visionary.\n\n\u201cThat is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn\u2019t appeal to business customers,\u201d Ballmer laughed in a TV interview after the launch of Apple\u2019s iPhone in 2007. Five years later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nA clip of a semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing around the stage to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed nearly five million times on YouTube, gaining him the nickname \u2018Monkey Boy\u2019. And his hypnotic and slightly unhinged mantra of \u2018developers, developers, developers\u2019, captured at another company conference, made him the butt of jokes for years after.\n\nA natural math whiz from Michigan, Ballmer met Gates at Harvard before Gates dropped out to co-found Microsoft in 1975. Five years later, Gates persuaded Ballmer to drop out of Stanford Business School to become Microsoft\u2019s first commercial manager, and only the company\u2019s 30th employee, giving him an 8 percent stake.\n\nAs Microsoft\u2019s first salesman, rather than a techie, he was viewed with some distrust.\n\n\u201cThe first time we met face-to-face, I thought this guy looks like an operative for the NKVD (Soviet police),\u201d recalled Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in his memoir. \u201cHe had piercing blue eyes and a genuine toughness. Though as I got to know him better, I found a gentler side as well.\u201d\n\nAllen said that the young Ballmer - a zealous basketball player and jogger - would wake him up at 7 a.m. doing push-ups in their shared hotel room on early business trips.\n\nAs Microsoft engineered the personal computer revolution through the 80s and 90s, the sales side of the organization grew in size and importance, led by the charismatic Ballmer - unmistakable on campus and at industry meetings with his shiny bald dome, strapping physique and booming voice.\n\nIn Microsoft-speak, employees were either a \u2018Bill guy\u2019, meaning a technology person, or a \u2018Steve guy\u2019, meaning a sales and marketing person.\n\nWhen Ballmer, known internally as SteveB, took over from Gates as Microsoft CEO in 2000, some saw it as the triumph of sales over technology and innovation, which ultimately ruined the company.\n\n\u201cI have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft,\u201d former Apple CEO Jobs is quoted as saying in his biography. \u201cThe quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen.\u201d\n\nJobs was partially correct. Under Ballmer\u2019s watch, Microsoft missed the shift to smartphones and tablets, and its share price has been static for the last decade. All the while, Ballmer tended to push out any executives who threatened his power.\n\n\u201cHis (Ballmer\u2018s) continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft\u2019s stock,\u201d prominent hedge fund investor David Einhorn said in 2011, as he campaigned publicly for Ballmer\u2019s ouster. Microsoft shares rose 7 percent on the news of Ballmer\u2019s retirement on Friday.\n\nBut Ballmer\u2019s record as a CEO was not as bad as many think. People close to him say his loud public persona belied a quietly shrewd business mind, and he managed Microsoft as well as anyone could as the company reached a mature stage.\n\nHe boosted Microsoft\u2019s revenues and more than doubled its already large profits. He outlasted erstwhile rivals such as Novell and Sun Microsystems, which have now all-but disappeared, and avoided the boardroom fiascos of Hewlett-Packard or dramatic decline of AOL.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody else on the management team at Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer,\u201d said Eric Jackson at hedge fund Ironfire Capital."

        "body": "By Robert Cyran The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nThe next boss of Microsoft needs a \u201cless is more\u201d mindset. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is finally on the way out. A $20 billion bump in the company\u2019s value following the news shows just how badly investors wanted a new approach. The wasteful \u201ctry everything\u201d strategy should go.\n\nBallmer inherited a near-monopoly in the Windows operating system and Office productivity software, and he has done well fattening up that cash cow. Microsoft earned $22 billion last year, more than twice as much as in 2000, when he became CEO. But his empire-building ambitions are evident in sales, which have increased more than three-fold.\n\nAbout three-quarters of profit still comes from Windows, Office and the like, with the company\u2019s server & tools division making up most of the rest. The online services division, which contains search engine Bing, has been bleeding cash, losing $12 billion in the past three years alone. The entertainment and devices division is in the black, but hasn\u2019t yet come close to recouping its cost of capital. Its missteps include the awful Zune music player and Kin phone.\n\nThe company says it still wants to sell more devices and has only just started its push in that direction. The firm also says it might take up to a year to find a new CEO. Insiders like Terry Myerson, in charge of operating systems, could be in the running, as could exiled former rivals to Ballmer like Paul Maritz and dark-horse outsiders like Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nWhoever lands the job can score quick points by narrowing the focus on business software, at least to begin with. Selling the Xbox gaming unit could bring in some extra capital. Shutting down or spinning off search and Microsoft\u2019s efforts in mobile devices would reduce losses such as the $900 million writedown it took on its Surface tablets in July. It would also allow the company to concentrate on things like making Office work well on gadgets such as Apple\u2019s iPad.\n\nConcentrating on business software would also make Microsoft simpler to understand and manage, tasks that became more complicated-looking in Ballmer\u2019s last reorganization. Shareholders would surely be happy with the prospect of higher cash returns, too. Even the outgoing CEO might find solace. The promise of his departure boosted the value of his 4 percent stake by approaching $1 billion, and real change would deliver more."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose in light trading on Friday, led by a jump in Microsoft shares, as trading took place without interruption a day after the Nasdaq stock exchange suffered an unprecedented, three-hour trading halt.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT.O) shares posted their largest daily percentage gain in more than four years after the head of the world\u2019s largest software company, Steve Ballmer, announced he will retire within 12 months.\n\nThe stock closed up 7.3 percent at $34.77 and was the largest contributor to the advance on the three major indexes.\n\n\u201cThe big news today is the succession at Microsoft, but beyond that it\u2019s pretty quiet,\u201d said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 46.77 points or 0.31 percent, to 15,010.51, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 6.54 points or 0.39 percent, to 1,663.5 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 19.085 points or 0.52 percent, to 3,657.792.\n\nVolume was among the lowest of the year with about 4.9 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, far below the daily average so far this year of about 6.3 billion shares.\n\nTrading volume was only slightly higher than Thursday\u2019s 4.4 billion, affected by a technological problem that shut down trading in Nasdaq securities for three hours in the afternoon.\n\nOn Friday, Robert Greifeld, chief executive officer of Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ.O) said the exchange resolved the technical problems that led to the halt but could not guarantee there would never be future glitches. Nasdaq shares gained 1.2 percent to close at $30.83.\n\nFriday\u2019s gains helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite end a two-week losing streak, but the Dow posted its third consecutive weekly decline. For the week the Dow fell 0.5 percent, the S&P gained 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq added 1.5 percent.\n\nEconomic data showed sales of new single-family homes fell by 13.4 percent in July to an annual rate of 394,000 units, well below expectations of 490,000 units.\n\nThe data weighed on homebuilder stocks, with PulteGroup (PHM.N) down 1.6 percent to $16.06 and Toll Brothers (TOL.N) off 3.9 percent to $31.19. The PHLX housing sector index .HGX lost 1.6 percent.\n\nPandora Media Inc (P.N) slumped 12.9 percent to $18.91 after the Internet radio service said late Thursday that rising expenditures to acquire music and expand its sales force would push fiscal 2014 earnings below analyst expectations.\n\nAeropostale Inc ARO.N tumbled 20.2 percent to $8.76 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a steep third-quarter loss.\n\nShares of Autodesk (ADSK.O) rallied 7.7 percent to $38.91 after earlier hitting $41.72, its highest level since April 2012.\n\nRoughly two issues rose for every one that fell on the NYSE and on Nasdaq 13 rose for every 11 decliners."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp CEO Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announced on Friday that he would retire in 2014, 13 years after he took over the dominant personal computer software company and tried to steer it into growing markets like video games, portable music players, smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe following is a chronology of events during Ballmer\u2019s time as Microsoft chief executive.\n\n1998 - Ballmer assumes role of president at Microsoft and takes charge of day-to-day operations. Prior to that, he led numerous divisions, including sales and support and operating-systems development. 2000 - Ballmer succeeds Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in January. The two met as students at Harvard University, where Gates lived down the hall from Ballmer. In 1975, 19-year-old Gates dropped out of Harvard and went on to found Microsoft along with Paul Allen. 2001 - In November, Microsoft enters the gaming market with the North American release of its Xbox gaming console, competing with game consoles from Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Corp. . 2005 - Microsoft launches the next-generation Xbox 360 video game console in November, strengthening its foothold in the video game hardware market. 2006 - Microsoft launches Zune portable music player in November. It is the first Microsoft-designed device to compete in a market dominated by Apple Inc\u2019s iPod. The music player does not gain enough of a market, and Microsoft discontinues selling it by mid-2012. 2007 - In January, Microsoft unveils the Windows Vista, which becomes the company\u2019s least popular operating system. 2008 -- Ballmer makes an unsolicited $44.6 billion, $31-per-share, cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo Inc\u2019s board. Yahoo rejects the bid as too low. 2009 - Microsoft revamps its search engine to counter Google Inc\u2019s dominance in the Web search and related advertising business. In May, Ballmer reveals the new search engine, dubbed \u201cBing\u201d that is set for a June release. 2009 -- In July, Microsoft and Yahoo launch a 10-year Web search deal to challenge market leader Google. Under the deal, the two companies agree that Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo\u2019s sites. They have been in on-again, off-again talks since Yahoo rebuffed Microsoft\u2019s takeover bid. 2010 - Microsoft releases its Windows Phone operating system for mobile phones, trying to claw its way into the smartphone market and woo consumers away from Apple\u2019s iPhone and Google\u2019s Andriod devices. 2011 - In February, Nokia and Microsoft strike a deal, in a bid to take on the smartphone market. By 2013, the partnership has yet to produce a product that has taken market share from Google and Apple. 2012 - Microsoft, hoping for a hit, launches Surface tablets and its Windows 8 operating system that uses touch commands. The devices do not gain much market share in the tablet market, dominated by Apple\u2019s iPad and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy mobile devices. 2013 - On August 23, Ballmer announces he will step down within 12 months, surprising industry watchers."

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has set up a special committee to find a new chief executive after Steve Ballmer announced his retirement on Friday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software company has no anointed successor, and has had only two CEOs in its 38-year history - Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates.\n\nThe following is a list of tech executives that Microsoft might consider.\n\nTony Bates - Came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired Skype and was recently elevated to lead Microsoft\u2019s business development and overall strategy.\n\nTerry Myerson - The executive in charge of operating systems, which is still the heart of Microsoft, ranging across PCs, tablets, phones and the Xbox game console.\n\nSatya Nadella - Heads Microsoft\u2019s cloud and enterprise group, which is coming to the fore as the company struggles to catch up in online and mobile computing.\n\nKevin Turner - As Chief Operating Officer for the last eight years, the former Wal-Mart Stores Inc executive leads Microsoft\u2019s enormous sales organization, but is generally considered to lack the technology credibility to be CEO.\n\nThe former head of the Windows unit was widely tipped as a potential Microsoft CEO until his abrupt departure in November. His reputation has taken a hit since then with the dismal sales of the Surface tablet he launched and the lukewarm reception of Windows 8.\n\nThe high-flying Google Inc engineer, key to that company\u2019s mobile phone and social initiatives, is a former Microsoft executive who could be tempted to return.\n\nThe CEO of Netflix Inc is a rising Silicon Valley star and has intimate knowledge of Microsoft\u2019s business after several years on its board, until his departure last year.\n\nOne of the key powers in the early days of Windows, Maritz left in 2000 and eventually ran virtualization firm VMware Inc until last year. Talk occasionally surfaces that he could return to Microsoft, but he has never indicated any interest publicly.\n\nThe co-founder of Microsoft is still Chairman, but has focused his day-to-day efforts on philanthropy since 2008 when he vacated his office on campus. People close to him say he is not considering a return to the CEO position."
