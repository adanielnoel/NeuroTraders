        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - To impress shareholders, Yahoo Inc\u2019s YHOO.O next chief executive needs just one qualification: the willingness to do a deal with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).\n\nThat\u2019s because this remains Yahoo\u2019s best option, short of a dramatic turnaround plan, analysts said.\n\nBut if Microsoft does eventually buy Yahoo, shareholders should brace themselves for a price far lower than the $47.5 billion the software behemoth offered earlier this year.\n\nWall Street analysts estimate that Microsoft would not offer more than $17-$20 per share for Yahoo, whose stock has fallen below $12 from a high of $30.25 in February.\n\nOnline display advertising, a core Yahoo business, has also shrunk as corporate advertisers scale back on Web marketing promotions amid a global economic slump.\n\nUnder Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who on Monday agreed to step down from his role once the board finds a replacement, Yahoo searched for alternatives to being bought, exploring partnerships with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Time Warner Inc\u2019s (TWX.N) AOL unit.\n\nBut Google, which struck a search advertising deal with Yahoo in June only to abandon it as regulatory concerns grew, is unlikely to come back for more.\n\nMeanwhile, Yahoo\u2019s months-long discussions with Time Warner about combining its AOL unit, have not led to a deal so far.\n\nAnd Microsoft, for all its proclamations to the contrary, still needs Yahoo\u2019s assets to bolster its presence in online search and advertising, analysts said.\n\nBut the scales will be tipped in Microsoft\u2019s favor if and when the new Yahoo CEO does reach out to negotiate a new deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be Microsoft calling Yahoo saying, \u2018We\u2019re making a bid for $17 a share\u2019,\u201d Needham & Co analyst Mark May said.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is done negotiating with Yahoo. If Yahoo wants to do a deal, its board needs to have full agreement\u201d on the price they want to sell the company for, May added.\n\nMicrosoft offered to buy Yahoo for $44.6 billion on January 31, which Yahoo rejected. It sweetened its cash-and-stock bid to $47.5 billion, but withdrew it after talks fell apart on price.\n\nMicrosoft later came back with a proposal to buy Yahoo\u2019s search assets, but Yahoo turned it down as well, choosing to team up with archrival Google instead.\n\nYahoo and Time Warner also began talking about a deal under which Yahoo would fold AOL\u2019s online content and advertising assets into its operations, with Time Warner taking a stake in the combined company, sources have told Reuters.\n\nDespite advanced talks, a deal hasn\u2019t happened because of challenges to valuing the businesses given the weak advertising market and Yahoo\u2019s falling stock price, as well as concerns over integrating the platforms, the sources have said.\n\nAnalysts have been skeptical about such a deal because they don\u2019t believe it would dramatically improve Yahoo\u2019s earnings.\n\n\u201cYahoo-AOL? What would that bring to the table? There\u2019s no point in having a marriage of convenience. It\u2019s not going to last,\u201d said Mukul Krishna, global digital media director at Frost & Sullivan, a research and consulting firm.\n\nKrishna said Yahoo\u2019s shareholders are looking for something more tangible to offset the stock\u2019s losses.\n\nYahoo needs either a substantial turnaround plan, complete with cost-cutting and a \u201croadmap to profitability,\u201d or an acquisition by Microsoft to satisfy investors, Krishna said.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft will be only too happy to restart the conversation, but it will be calling the shots,\u201d he said.\n\nActivist investor Carl Icahn\u2019s presence on Yahoo\u2019s board may help bring Microsoft to the table, analysts said.\n\nIcahn, a major Yahoo shareholder, has publicly reiterated hopes of a Yahoo-Microsoft deal several times. He did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nAnalysts said they expect Microsoft to eventually come back because it needs Yahoo nearly as much as Yahoo needs it.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft wants Yahoo\u2019s search audience, the traffic, the clicks,\u201d Needham\u2019s May said. \u201cThey want to have as much as Google does. So it\u2019s important for Microsoft to have a big presence in search and display.\u201d\n\nBut Cowen & Co analyst Jim Friedland said Microsoft is unlikely to want to rush into talks with Yahoo even with a new CEO knocking on its door.\n\nBoth companies are seeing declines in their Web businesses due to the global economic downturn, and as Yahoo\u2019s \u201conly potential buyer,\u201d Microsoft can take its time, he said."
