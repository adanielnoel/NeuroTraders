        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - China\u2019s ZTE Corp, one of the world\u2019s largest smartphone makers, has agreed to pay Microsoft Corp a royalty for devices it makes using Google Inc\u2019s Android and Chrome operating systems.\n\nZTE is the latest in a line of hardware manufacturers that have struck a patent deal with Microsoft, which has successfully argued that Android - which Google provides free to handset makers - uses Microsoft-owned technology.\n\nGoogle itself, and its Motorola phone maker unit, are the most notable holdouts against a patent agreement with Microsoft. Those differences could be settled soon, depending on the judge\u2019s verdict in a patent trial in Seattle.\n\nReaching agreement with ZTE means Microsoft now has patent deals in place with four of the five leading Android phone makers.\n\nIt already has agreements with South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Corp, and with Taiwan\u2019s HTC Corp.\n\nIt has no deal with China\u2019s fast-growing Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.\n\nThe ZTE deal marks progress for Microsoft with companies operating in China, following last week\u2019s patent agreement with contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, parent of Foxconn.\n\nMicrosoft said it now has Android patent deals with about 20 device makers, and 60 percent of Android phones sold worldwide are covered by a Microsoft patent license."

It also announced a new $3.7 million in funding.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s research, it takes an average of 40 hours to completely move a business to Office 365, the online Microsoft product suite that includes Word Online, Excel Online, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. SkyKick was founded by executives from Microsoft\u2019s Office and Bing teams who left in 2011 to build an automated solution that would make the transition easier.\n\n\u201cMoving Microsoft\u2019s SMB Office base to the cloud is a massive undertaking and will require high engagement from Microsoft\u2019s vast partner base,\u201d said CEO Evan Richman in a statement. \u201cSkyKick takes what has traditionally been a two to six week IT services project and makes it more transactional and scalable creating a win-win market scenario \u2014 any Microsoft partner can easily and profitably move their SMB customers to Office 365, giving SMBs a great experience at a great value.\u201d\n\nDuring its private beta, SkyKick helped move thousands of businesses to Office 365 using three products that take clients from the planning stages through to full implementation. WebPlanner is a project management application that helps customers plan the migration process. Migration Sync moves customer account and user data, like email, calendar, contacts etc \u2026 to Office 365, and Outlook Assistant is geared towards the \u201clast-mile challenges\u201d that often impede the migration process."
