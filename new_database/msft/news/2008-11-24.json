        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Microsoft will be filled to the gills with \u201cThe Guild.\u201d\n\nThe software giant has an exclusive lock on the long-awaited second season of the Internet cult hit, which will be the first to be distributed worldwide simultaneously across Microsoft\u2019s triple platform of Xbox 360\u2019s Live Marketplace, MSN and Zune.\n\nSprint has signed on to sponsor the 12-episode run, making it the first marketer to test Microsoft\u2019s new strategy to draw ad dollars with the combined reach of a gaming console, Internet portal and portable media player.\n\nA scripted comedy chronicling the misadventures of a group of online gamers, \u201cGuild\u201d premieres Tuesday on Independent Video, Xbox\u2019s new channel devoted to original content. \u201cGuild\u201d will lead a collection of ad-supported and fee-based programs, including such other game-oriented fare as \u201cThe Jace Hall Show,\u201d \u201cRed vs. Blue\u201d and first-season episodes of \u201cGuild.\u201d\n\nAlthough launching with just five or six programs, Xbox has ambitions of expanding Independent Video beyond the gaming theme to embrace a broader audience. The channel is launching with the only other original deal it has done to date, the webisode \u201cHorror Meets Comedy\u201d from Safran Media Group, which is not gaming-related.\n\nAfter reaching 9 million views with a 10-episode season financed from viewer contributions via PayPal, \u201cGuild\u201d emerged last year as one of the more buzzed-about webisodes. Its star, creator and writer-producer, Felicia Day, has become the face of the original Web production world, starring opposite Neil Patrick Harris in one of the few other success stories in online originals, \u201cDr. Horrible\u2019s Sing-Along Blog,\u201d created by Joss Whedon. \u201cHorrible\u201d also is syndicated on Xbox\u2019s Independent Video.\n\nA key component of the deal allows for Day to retain the intellectual property rights to \u201cGuild\u201d while collecting an unspecified upfront license fee. A who\u2019s who of Web brands courted Day for rights to \u201cGuild,\u201d from old-media companies to gamer-centric ad networks, though many insisted on retaining the traditional set of rights.\n\nBut Day had been holding out for more than a year in search of a deal that gave her control of the creative and business sides of \u201cGuild.\u201d \u201cI was adamant about holding on to the rights of my series,\u201d she said.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft will not participate in revenue should \u201cGuild\u201d eventually graduate to TV or film, though the corporation does hold on to any gaming-related extensions. Which is fine by Scott Nocas, group product manager at Xbox Live.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a software and hardware company,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to do a movie deal, that\u2019s not our core business.\u201d\n\nFour weeks after each episode of \u201cGuild\u201d airs, it moves into a second window on Watchtheguild.com, home base for the first season\u2019s episodes. However, Microsoft retains ad revenue in that window as well as in an unspecified split because episodes will air in an embedded MSN media player. Once the entire season is completed by the end of February, Day can make a new deal for a nonexclusive run beyond Microsoft.\n\nAn added plus for going with Xbox is that \u201cGuild\u201d will be distributed day-and-date in nine languages in 26 countries where Xbox Live operates, reaching 14 million users. \u201cGuild\u201d found unintended international appeal late in its run, according to Day.\n\nSprint will attach itself to \u201cGuild\u201d in various ways from preroll messaging to branded entertainment; mobile phone Sprint Instinct is shown being used by one of the series\u2019 characters.\n\nEach \u201cGuild\u201d episode runs 4-7 minutes long. A separate holiday special is also covered under the deal, which will allow \u201cGuild\u201d to shoot in high-definition for its Xbox window.\n\nBefore the introduction of Independent Video, which was deployed last week as part of a relaunch of the Xbox Live Marketplace interface, all TV and film content was available on a transactional basis. \u201cGuild\u201d and \u201cHorror,\u201d which is sponsored by the Air Force, will be Xbox\u2019s first free programs.\n\n\u201cHorror\u201d also will be pushed through all three Microsoft distribution points but won\u2019t move to MSN and Zune until after its Xbox run."
