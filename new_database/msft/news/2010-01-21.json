        "body": "As Microsoft patched the Internet Explorer (IE) vulnerability that was used to break into Google\u2019s network, it also acknowledged that it had known of the bug since August 2009, when an Israeli security company reported the flaw.\n\n\u201cAs part of [our] investigation, we also determined that the vulnerability was the same as a vulnerability responsibly reported to us and confirmed in early September,\u201d said Jerry Bryant, a senior program manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center, on the MSRC blog today.\n\nThe MS10-002 bulletin that accompanied the IE update credited Meron Sellem of BugSec for reporting the bug that has raised a ruckus since Google accused Chinese cybercriminals with hacking its network.\n\nSellem said that BugSec, a penetration testing and security firm in Rishon LeZion, Israel, reported the vulnerability to Microsoft on Aug. 26, not in September as Microsoft indicated. And he was critical of Microsoft for taking this long to release a patch. \u201cI think yes, it took too long,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Microsoft is a big organization and we don\u2019t know how much time it takes them. We asked them why it was taking such a long time, and they said it was because of the testing they had to do.\u201d\n\nAndrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, said the fact that Microsoft knew of the vulnerability months before it crafted a patch -- months before Chinese criminals used the flaw -- shouldn\u2019t come as a shock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty par for the course, really,\u201d said Storms. \u201cWe know that patches sit for a good month or so in QA [quality assurance] at Microsoft. So if it was reported to Microsoft in September, it might not have been added to the [patch] cycle until October, and the code not written until November. A February release isn\u2019t crazy then.\u201d\n\nStorms refused to use hindsight to say that Microsoft was tardy to the party. \u201cUnless you have real evidence that it\u2019s being used, you can\u2019t take that into account when you prioritize patches,\u201d he argued. \u201cYou take into account the skill level necessary to exploit it. But if it\u2019s responsibly disclosed, you have to assume that it\u2019s not going to release [publicly]. And without partners saying that they\u2019re seeing signs of it being exploited, Microsoft probably thought they could just roll it into their normal IE release cycle.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft last patched IE in December 2009, and on average, updated its browser every two months.\n\nIt didn\u2019t surprise Sellem that others found the vulnerability, then decided to use it maliciously. \u201cWe found this vulnerability very easily,\u201d said Sellem, \u201cand we didn\u2019t think it would be hard for others to find.\u201d BugSec spent about two weeks researching IE before it discovered the flaw, Sellem added.\n\n\u201cThere have certainly been cases when multiple people have reported the same bug, so it\u2019s not hard to fathom that more than one could have found this at around the same time,\u201d said Storms.\n\nBesides the patch for the vulnerability used to attack Google and others, Microsoft also patched seven other bugs in IE in today\u2019s update. Of the eight flaws fixed today, seven were rated \u201ccritical\u201d by Microsoft, the highest threat ranking in its four-step scoring system.\n\n\u201cActually, we\u2019re getting February\u2019s IE update early,\u201d said Storms, referring to Microsoft\u2019s admission that this \u201cout-of-band\u201d was previously planned for Feb. 9, the company\u2019s next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday.\n\n\u201cEarlier, I was a bit surprised how quickly they said they would patch [the Google] bug, but now it all makes sense,\u201d said Storms. \u201cThese were already in QA -- they would have had to be if there were going to release them in February -- so it\u2019s no surprise that they were able to release a fix in two weeks time.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Bryant said that the company was alerted that hackers were actively using the IE vulnerability only on Jan. 11. Google, however, said it first uncovered evidence of attacks on its network in mid-December 2009, and began reaching out to other companies that may have been victimized shortly after.\n\nNo matter when this patch would have hit, Google attack or not, it would have been a big deal. \u201cIf this had come out in February, it would have been the most important patch of the day,\u201d Storms argued. \u201cIt\u2019s client side, it\u2019s IE, it has a good handful of remote code vulnerabilities, so this would have been the No. 1 to go out and patch immediately.\u201d In fact, Storms expects that researchers, both legitimate and criminal, will be digging into the cumulative update, looking for hints that will lead them to other exploits.\n\n\u201cSo I guess we can be thankful that we\u2019re getting it early,\u201d said Storms.\n\nThe IE security update can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

        "body": "A federal judge has killed class-action allegations in a lawsuit that accused Microsoft of misleading consumers when it fed them anti-piracy software under the auspices of a critical security update, according to court documents.\n\nThe move means that Microsoft will not be faced with millions in potential damages. Last fall, Microsoft\u2019s lawyers argued that a class-action lawsuit could involve \u201ctens of millions\u201d of customers who might be owed \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d if the company lost the case.\n\nA class-action would have let virtually anyone who owned a Windows XP PC in mid-2006 to join the case without having to hire an attorney.\n\nIn an order filed on Jan. 15, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones denied several motions by the plaintiffs, including one that would have let them modify their complaint a third time, which in turn put an official end to their attempts to turn the case into a class-action lawsuit.\n\nThe three-and-a-half-year-old lawsuit claims Microsoft duped customers by labeling its Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) software a critical security update, failed to tell them that WGA collected information from their PCs, then frequently \u201cphoned home\u201d that data to Microsoft\u2019s servers.\n\nIn June 2006, Microsoft began pushing WGA to Windows XP users via Windows Update, the company\u2019s default update service, as a \u201chigh priority\u201d update that was automatically downloaded and installed to most machines.\n\nShortly after that, Microsoft acknowledged that WGA transmitted information whenever a user logged on to Windows XP. Under pressure from critics , it later reduced the frequency of the anti-piracy checks.\n\nMicrosoft relies on WGA, and its successor, Windows Activation Technologies (WAT), to detect bootlegged copies of Windows. If the software sniffs out a counterfeit, it posts nagging messages on the screen.\n\nMicrosoft had opposed the class-action certification last September, at the time calling the lawsuit \u201cfictional,\u201d \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d and from an \u201calternate universe.\u201d\n\nLast month, the plaintiffs withdrew most, but not all, of their class action allegations, but said they were reserving the right to revisit one of those claims, breach of contract, because an earlier court decision related to that charge is currently on appeal.\n\nIn his order of last week, Jones said that all class allegations had to be withdrawn because they \u201cneed not be included for appellate purposes and would create unnecessary confusion if they were included.\u201d\n\nJones also said that Microsoft could demand compensation for the money it spent contesting the class-action charges, even though the plaintiffs withdrew most of those allegations prior to trial.\n\n\u201cWhile Plaintiffs maintain a \u2018no harm, no foul\u2019 perspective, it is too late for that argument,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf Plaintiffs had withdrawn their class-certification motion before Microsoft had prepared its Opposition, that would be a \u2018no harm, no foul\u2019 situation. But here, the \u2018harm\u2019 was irreversibly inflicted when Plaintiffs\u2019 motion required Microsoft to prepare a defense.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has until Feb. 12 to submit its expense list to the court.\n\nJones also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to add a misrepresentation charge to the lawsuit, and said that they could not change the complaint to seek additional forms of relief from injunction. Earlier this month, Microsoft had called those moves \u201ca cynical attempt to game the system.\u201d\n\nThe case was once scheduled to go to trial on Jan. 25, but Jones asked counsel for both parties to suggest a new calendar.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s anti-piracy software has often made news. In August 2007, a day-long server outage riled thousands of users who were mistakenly fingered for running counterfeit copies of Windows. More recently, hackers revealed ways to bypass Windows 7\u2019s activation process .\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

        "body": "My aunt recently told me about a problem with her new laptop: Whenever she\u2019d step away from it for more than a few minutes, she\u2019d close the lid. Upon returning, she\u2019d open the lid, only to be faced with a blank screen and no response from the mouse or keyboard.\n\nWant to know why? The default lid-closing action for most laptops is to put the system in \u201csleep\u201d mode, and Windows is notoriously bad at waking up properly.\n\nThat\u2019s why I advise most laptop users to use \u201chibernate\u201d mode instead, as it\u2019s much more reliable when it comes to waking up.\n\nYou see, sleep (a.k.a. standby) puts your system into a low-power, off-like state, allowing you to pick up where you left off (in theory, anyway) after just a few seconds. However, a PC in standby mode continues to consume battery power, so it\u2019s not uncommon to return to a \u201csleeping\u201d PC to find that it\u2019s just plain dead. Or, in my aunt\u2019s case, unresponsive.\n\nHibernate, on the other hand, saves your machine\u2019s current state to a temporary hard-drive file, then shuts down completely (much like \u201coff\u201d). When you start it up again, it loads that file and returns you to where you left off--no booting required.\n\nBoth ends of the hibernate process take a little longer than sleep mode (usually 10-20 seconds, in my experience), but you avoid any of the issues that can arise when Windows suddenly loses power.\n\nAnd as noted, sleep mode is notoriously flaky. If your system refuses to wake up properly, you\u2019ll end up losing whatever documents and/or Web pages you had open.\n\nConsequently, I recommend using hibernate most of the time. Found out how in my earlier post on changing the function of your laptop\u2019s power button.\n\nWhile you\u2019re at it, learn how to give your laptop\u2019s battery a longer lease on life and, if you\u2019re a Vista user, turn the Sleep button into a Power button.\n\nComing up tomorrow: The importance of learning where to save file attachments -- so you can find them again later."

        "body": "Microsoft Corp.\u2019s top legal official yesterday called on Congress to create new laws that would give data stored in the cloud the same protections as data stored on a PC. He also called for tougher penalties for hackers who access data centers, citing significant damage that\u2019s often done in such attacks.\n\nBrad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel at Microsoft, told an audience at a Brookings Institution forum here today that laws now protecting electronic data were written in the early days of PCs. \u201cWe need Congress to modernize the laws and adapt them to the cloud,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile many consumers have adopted cloud computing by subscribing to e-mail services like Google Gmail, to social networks like Facebook and to Microsoft\u2019s increasing online services offerings, enterprises have been somewhat cautious about moving corporate data to hosted systems due to legal and security concerns both here and abroad. Those fears have been causing problem for IT vendors, forcing some to provide significant protections to large users.\n\nThe city of City of Los Angeles\u2019 move to implement Google Apps is one example of how cloud providers must tweak contracts to win business.\n\nThe city\u2019s $7.2 million agreement with Google to move 30,000 employees to Google Apps included an unlimited damages provision that makes the Google legally responsible for the release of data in violation of a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nMoreover, the contract signed last October obligates Google to keep the city\u2019s data physically located in the United States. The contract allows the city to audit the data to ensure compliance.\n\nSmith outlined a number of changes to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act that he says are needed to clearly extend privacy rights to data stored in the cloud and to boost penalties for hacking data centers.\n\nProviders of cloud computing products, meanwhile, are also hoping for an international accord that would ensure similar rules to data regardless of whether it is stored on servers in India, France or Brazil.\n\n\u201cAre we going to end up with a Tower of Babel version of the cloud where there are different rules in different countries?\u201d said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies, the Brookings Institution, who led a panel discussion on the topic.\n\n\u201dWe need a free trade agreement for data and information,\u2019 said Smith.\n\nMichael Nelson, a visiting professor at Georgetown University, offered a stark warning about the future if Congress fails to act. \u201cWe are going to see the cloud as something that is controlled by two or three companies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called for creating a cloud environment built on open source technology and open standards so users can take something from one cloud and combine it with another. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be locked into one company\u2019s solution,\u201d he said.\n\nUsers of cloud services will need to know what is happening to their data, Nelson added. Cloud providers will not only have to ensure data is safe, but \u201cwe are going to have to show them why it is safe,\u201d he said, and that will mean having technology that can show customers when their data is accessed.\n\nJonathan Rochelle, a group product manager at Google, said there is nothing special about the privacy and security risks in the cloud, but those risk are \u201cmore transparent, more collective and more open. \u201d\n\nUsers can keep their data on their PCs, but \u201dwhile it feels more comfortable, the same way the money under your mattress feels more comfortable, it may not be the best way to manage your information,\u2019 said Rochelle.\n\nPatrick Thibodeau covers SaaS and enterprise applications, outsourcing, government IT policies, data centers and IT workforce issues for Computerworld .

        "body": "Microsoft late yesterday issued its second advisory of the last week, warning users that a 17-year-old bug in the kernel of all 32-bit versions of Windows could be used by hackers to hijack PCs.\n\nThe vulnerability in the Windows Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) subsystem was disclosed Tuesday by Google engineer Tavis Ormandy on the Full Disclosure security mailing list. Coincidentally, Ormandy received credit for reporting the single vulnerability that Microsoft fixed last week on its regular Patch Tuesday.\n\nThe VDM subsystem was added to Windows with the July 1993 release of Windows NT, Microsoft\u2019s first fully 32-bit operating system. VDM allows Windows NT and later to run DOS and 16-bit Windows software.\n\nYesterday\u2019s advisory spelled out the affected software -- all 32-bit editions of Windows, including Windows 7 -- and told users how to disable VDM as a workaround. Windows\u2019 64-bit versions are not vulnerable to attack.\n\nIt was Microsoft\u2019s second advisory in seven days; last week, the company posted a warning of a critical flaw in Internet Explorer after Google said its corporate computers had been hacked by Chinese attackers. That bug is to be patched later today .\n\n\u201cAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode,\u201d said the newest advisory. \u201cAn attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\u201d\n\nJerry Bryant, a program manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), said that the company had not seen any actual attacks using the vulnerability, and also downplayed the threat if hackers do exploit the flaw. \u201cTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must already have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to a system locally, meaning they must already have an account on the system,\u201d Bryant said in an e-mail.\n\nTypically, Microsoft ranks this kind of vulnerability -- which it classified as an elevation of privilege flaw -- as \u201cimportant,\u201d the second-highest of the four ratings in its four-step system.\n\nOrmandy said that the vulnerability goes back nearly 17 years to Windows NT 3.1\u2019s release, and exists in every version of Windows since. He reported the bug to Microsoft more than seven months ago.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, no official patch is currently available,\u201d Ormandy wrote on Full Disclosure Tuesday. \u201cAs an effective and easy-to-deploy workaround is available, I have concluded that it is in the best interest of users to go ahead with the publication of this document without an official patch.\u201d The workaround Ormandy included in his message was the same as Microsoft\u2018s: Edit group policies to block 16-bit applications from running.\n\nAlthough Ormandy divulged information about the vulnerability, even posted attack code that works on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008 and Windows 7, Microsoft didn\u2019t take him to task in the advisory for prematurely revealing the bug, as it almost always does researchers who spill the beans before a patch is ready.\n\nPresumably, Microsoft will issue a fix for the flaw at some point, but as is its practice in security advisories, it didn\u2019t promise to do so. The next regularly-scheduled security update is slated for Feb. 9.\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

        "body": "Microsoft mobile chief Robbie Bach may believe that the Linux OS will lose out to Windows Mobile in the smartphone space, but Linux Foundation director Jim Zemlin is having none of that.\n\nIn a blog post this week, Zemlin fired back at comments Bach made to financial analysts at CES (consumer electronics show) that there is too much complexity in Linux and too many versions for phone carriers to manage.\n\n\u201cBy Bach\u2019s count there are 17 variants of Linux available on mobile phones,\u201d writes Zemlin. \u201cHe sees this as a bad thing for customers. We, unsurprisingly, see this as a bad thing for Microsoft.\u201d\n\nAt CES, Bach, president of Microsoft\u2019s Entertainment and Devices division, predicted a mobile OS shake-out where carriers will reject some Linux mobile operating systems because they complicate support issues. He stated that that various versions of Linux on mobile are \u201ca little quirky and a little different, require separate network certifications, network product support, and the like that goes along with that.\u201d\n\nBach also said that mobile Linux\u2019s \u201cquality bar won\u2019t stack up, and they won\u2019t get the scale that they need.\u201d\n\nTo that line of argument, Zemlin countered that Linux mobile variants such as Android, Moblin, Palm WebOS, Maemo and others are growing rapidly on mobile devices ranging from smartphones to netbooks precisely because of the choice they offer hardware makers.\n\n\u201cPalm, Motorola and others have jumped ship from Windows Mobile to Linux-based offerings in recent years,\u201d writes Zemlin. \u201cLG is now using Android on 50 percent of its handsets. According to Gartner Group, Windows Mobile\u2019s global market share fell to 7.9 percent in the third quarter of 2009 down from 11.1 percent the same quarter of last year.\u201d\n\nThat Gartner report also cites that Android\u2019s market share grew from 0 percent in Q3 of 2008 (because it was brand new) to 3.9 percent in Q3 of 2009.\n\nIndeed, Windows Mobile has been losing market share for the past two years while the iPhone and BlackBerry devices have had steady growth. An October survey by market researcher comScore marked the first time Windows Mobile\u2019s market share has fallen behind the iPhone, putting the iPhone in second place below BlackBerry and dropping Windows Mobile to third place.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help Microsoft that the poorly-received Windows Mobile 6.5 is seen as a placeholder for when the real deal Windows Mobile 7 hits the market. Yet WinMo 7 delays - it reportedly may not be released until 2011 - have curbed momentum for the OS and allowed Google\u2019s Linux-based Android time to win over phone makers, consumers and businesses.\n\nIn his post, Zemlin criticizes Windows Mobile\u2019s entire business model, pointing out that phone carriers and manufacturers have to pay Microsoft a per-device charge for Windows Mobile, but pay nothing for Linux-based platforms.\n\nHe also attacks the branding and licensing restrictions of Windows Mobile. \u201cBasically Microsoft wants to \u2018own the glass.\u2019 With Linux you have multiple ways to brand and market your product, making it your product.\u201d\n\nZemlin admits that individual variants of Linux may come and go and that working with Linux on mobile is a complex task, but with this complexity comes more choice in technology and branding flexibility for carriers and manufacturers, he says, \u201cinstead of getting the technology and pricing dictated to them from Redmond.\u201d\n\nZemlin also stresses that building a phone on Linux is simpler now than it was just a few years ago when \u201chandset manufacturers had to build from scratch their own OS if they didn\u2019t want to give up a big percentage of their margins to Microsoft.\u201d\n\nWhat Microsoft cannot deny is the sudden demand for Android phones with the recent release of devices like the Motorola Droid, Droid Eris and the new \u201cGoogle phone\u201d Nexus One. A December report from research firm Forrester forecasts that Android phones will take 10 percent of the mobile market in 2010 due to increased acceptance of the open OS by developers and industry support from partners such as Verizon, Qualcomm, Motorola and Google.\n\nZemlin references the Android surge in his blog post, offering a warning to Bach and Microsoft.\n\n\u201cI suppose if he [Bach] truly believes choice is a bad thing, he may truly believe Linux will lose, but unfortunately the market momentum and adoption numbers are proving quite the opposite.\u201d\n\nShane O\u2018Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

Google has alleged that the attacks were launched by Chinese attackers. Subsequently, security experts have offered evidence that links the attacks to China .\n\nThe revised advisory also addressed claims made by researchers that it\u2019s possible to exploit the newer IE7 and IE8 browsers, and even circumvent Microsoft\u2019s recommended defensive measure, DEP (data execution prevention). However, the advisory waffled on whether DEP bypass was effective, neither confirming or denying the researchers\u2019 allegations.\n\n\u201cThere is a report of a new Data Execution Prevention (DEP) exploit,\u201d Microsoft said in the advisory. \u201cWe have analyzed the proof-of-concept exploit code and have found that Windows Vista and later versions of Windows offer more effective protections in blocking the exploit due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).\u201d\n\nEven a follow-up post by Jonathan Ness, an MSRC engineer, on the company\u2019s Security Research & Defense blog declined to spell out whether the DEP bypass attacks were effective. Ness, however, did reiterate Microsoft\u2019s point that the only in-the-wild attacks seen thus far have been aimed at IE6.\n\nHe also touted the additional security that ASLR and IE\u2019s Protected Mode provide, and published a table that spelled out the current attack and threat situation for IE and Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft also admitted that the vulnerability could be exploited through malicious Office documents, a vector that had not been disclosed previously. \u201cWe are also aware that the vulnerability can be exploited by including an ActiveX control in a Microsoft Access, Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file,\u201d said Bryant. \u201cTo prevent exploitation, we recommend that customers disable ActiveX Controls in Microsoft Office.\u201d\n\nTomorrow\u2019s update for IE will patch all attack avenues, Bryant added, including the Office document vector.\n\nThe IE vulnerability has gained considerable attention because it has been connected to the attacks that broke into Google\u2019s corporate network. McAfee was the first to reveal that the attacks against Google had been conducted using exploits of the IE vulnerability.\n\nSince then, hackers have exploited the bug via drive-by attacks from malicious sites, and researchers have crafted new attack code that works on IE7 and IE8 .\n\nThe last time Microsoft shipped an emergency security update was July 2009, when it patched IE just hours before several researchers demonstrated a critical vulnerability at a security conference. In October 2008, Microsoft rushed out a patch for Windows; that vulnerability was later exploited by the notorious Conficker worm .\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday released a patch to protect users of its Internet Explorer browser from attacks similar to those directed at Google Inc\u2019s operations in China last week.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software company, which said hackers targeting Google and at least 20 other companies in China exploited a weakness in its browser, said its new patch was \u201ccritical\u201d and people should apply it as soon as possible.\n\nOther hackers have begun to exploit the flaw, according to researchers with Symantec Corp, the world\u2019s biggest security software maker.\n\nSymantec has found viruses that take advantage of the weakness in Microsoft\u2019s browser on some 100 websites, security researcher John Harrison said on Thursday.\n\nThey are dangerous because they can infect the PC of any user who visits those sites. Unlike less powerful viruses, it is not necessary for people to download software for their machines to become infected, Harrison said.\n\nPCs are safe if they apply the patch, which resolves eight vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Microsoft said. The most serious could allow hackers to gain control of a computer remotely via Web sites people visit while using the browser.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re always working, we have fewer vulnerabilities\n\nthan our competitors,\u201d said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer at an energy conference in Houston, addressing cyber-security concerns.\n\nHe gave no indication that Microsoft would change its business in China after Google threatened to quit the country last week. \u201cWe respect the laws of China, it\u2019s the only appropriate thing for us to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe viruses Symantec has found only successfully attack Internet Explorer 6, though hackers could figure out how to break through the defenses of Internet Explorer 7 and 8, the most recent version of the software, Symantec\u2019s Harrison said.\n\nMost Internet Explorer customers, who have automatic updating enabled on their systems, will not need to take any action on the security patch, Microsoft said. For manual updating, it directed users to its website (here)."
