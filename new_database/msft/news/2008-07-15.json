        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reports quarterly results this week, looking to ease the concerns of investors about slower growth at its Windows business and prove that its pursuit of Yahoo Inc YHOO.O is not a distraction.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software maker kicks off a crucial three-week period with earnings on Thursday, followed by an annual financial analysts meeting at its Redmond, Washington campus a week later.\n\nThen, Yahoo holds its annual shareholders meeting on August 1, which could determine whether Microsoft will be able to buy all or part of the Internet pioneer.\n\nFirst and foremost, investors will look for signs in Microsoft\u2019s results that corporate customers and consumers are upgrading to its new Windows Vista operating system. A weak U.S. economy and a poor reception for Vista has raised fears adoption may be weak.\n\nAnalysts forecast Microsoft would report fiscal fourth- quarter earnings of 47 cents a share on a 17 percent rise in revenue to $15.6 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nLast quarter, revenue at the Windows division, which accounts for more than half of the company\u2019s profit, were lower than expected due to an inventory build-up of computers and a lack of progress in the battle against piracy.\n\n\u201cWhat happened last quarter in the (Windows) client division was something that might persist,\u201d said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody is still concerned about.\u201d\n\nAnother concern is that large organizations will postpone upgrades to Vista, opting to wait for the next version of Windows code-named \u201cWindows 7.\u201d Microsoft is targeting a 2010 debut for \u201cWindows 7.\u201d\n\nIn a survey of chief investment officers conducted by Goldman Sachs, 43 percent said Vista deployment is likely to be delayed if technology budgets tighten in the second half of 2008. It was the highest percentage of all software projects.\n\nInvestors will also be probing Microsoft\u2019s updated forecasts for fiscal 2009 and estimates for its current quarter as an indicator of technology spending.\n\nIn late April, the company forecast fiscal 2009 earnings in a range between $2.13 and $2.19 per share on revenue of $66.9 billion to $68 billion. Analysts expect the results to be in the middle of the range, with EPS of $2.16 on revenue of $67.3 billion.\n\nFor the current quarter, analysts on average forecast the company will earn 49 cents per share on revenue of $15.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nAnalysts are expected to grill Microsoft executives about the company\u2019s on-again, off-again pursuit of Yahoo and alternative options to turn around its online service business, which has posted seven straight quarters of losses.\n\nThe negotiations between the two companies have turned ugly and Microsoft is now teaming up with investor Carl Icahn, who wants to oust Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang and replace the Web company\u2019s board with a group of directors more open to a deal with Microsoft.\n\n\u201cThese things can be distracting. I just worry that Microsoft\u2019s taking its eye off the ball to try to replicate what Google has put together on the Internet search side and its Web advertising model,\u201d said Todd Lowenstein, co-portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management\u2019s Value Momentum Fund.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we\u2019re all that crazy about it buying into Yahoo. It\u2019s not our favorite use of capital.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft shares have fallen about 20 percent since it went public with its unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo. By comparison, the S&P 500 has declined about 12 percent and the Nasdaq is down about 8 percent during that period.\n\nThe pullback on Microsoft shares is overdone, said Lowenstein, who manages 444,000 Microsoft shares in his fund, if you consider the amount of cash generated by the company, its debt-free balance sheet and competitive businesses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at the company that people don\u2019t give them enough credit for,\u201d said Lowenstein.\n\nThe stock is now trading at 13 times estimated 2008 earnings compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of around 20 for software companies.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s other businesses continue to hum along.\n\nThe Office division is attracting customers to its SharePoint collaboration software, while rolling out new products that allow companies to pay a monthly subscription to have Microsoft run its e-mail and other software programs.\n\nThe server and tools division rolled out a new version of Windows for computer servers with a new Hyper-V virtualization feature that allows customers to save money by running powerful computers more efficiently. It is an area where Microsoft has lagged behind VMware Inc (VMW.N).\n\nThe entertainment and device division announced a price cut to its Xbox 360 game console and introduced a new model with a larger hard drive ahead of this week\u2019s E3 video game industry trade show."

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top Microsoft Corp executive said Yahoo Inc\u2019s advertising search partnership with Google Inc would leave only one major player in the Internet search business, and said he had been told as much by Yahoo\u2019s own chief executive last month.\n\nTestifying at a congressional hearing, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said that in a June 8 meeting in San Jose Yahoo chief Jerry Yang described Internet search as a \u201cbipolar\u201d market, with Google on one side and Yahoo and Microsoft on the other.\n\n\u201c(Yang) said \u2018If we do this deal with Google, Yahoo will become part of Google\u2019s pole and Microsoft,\u2019 he said, \u2018would not be strong enough in this market to remain a pole of its own,'\u201d Smith told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee on Tuesday.\n\nHe said Microsoft executives met later in a separate conference room. \u201cWe sat down and we said, \u2018We can\u2019t believe that Jerry just said those things.'\u201d\n\nSmith used the anecdote to bolster Microsoft\u2019s contention that the Google-Yahoo deal would violate antitrust law.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty explosive stuff and we\u2019ll have to consider that,\u201d agreed the antitrust subcommittee\u2019s chairman, Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin.\n\nYahoo General Counsel Michael Callahan, also testifying at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, said he had been at the June 8 meeting but he disputed Smith\u2019s description of what Yang had said.\n\n\u201cI disagree with how Mr. Smith characterized what Mr. Yang thinks about the market,\u201d said Callahan. \u201cOur board of directors made a conscious decision to stay in search.\u201d\n\nKohl shot back: \u201cClearly what you said contradicts what your boss said.\u201d\n\nGoogle, with more than 60 percent of the Web search market, and Yahoo, with 16.6 percent, announced a deal on June 12 that would allow Yahoo to place Google advertisements on its site and collect the revenue. It has raised antitrust concerns because of their dominance of the market.\n\nThe Yahoo-Google partnership was widely seen as an effort by Yahoo to fend off Microsoft\u2019s on-again, off-again efforts to buy all or part of Yahoo.\n\nGoogle and Yahoo have refrained from consummating the deal while they wait for an opinion from antitrust authorities at the Justice Department. Several state attorneys general were also looking into the arrangement.\n\nCallahan accused Microsoft of teaming up with investor Carl Icahn to force down Yahoo\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft ... has turned to activist shareholder Carl Icahn, in the apparent hope that this will force a fire sale of Yahoo\u2019s core strategic search business,\u201d he said.\n\nIcahn is leading a proxy campaign to dump Yahoo\u2019s current management and board at the August shareholder meeting.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s most recent offer to acquire Yahoo\u2019s search business was rejected Saturday evening by Yahoo, which said it was open to a full-scale merger with Microsoft if it offered at least $33 a share, or $47.5 billion.\n\nMicrosoft had offered $31-per-share cash on January 31, when it tendered its first offer, and then raised it to $33 per share. Yahoo rejected it, demanding at least $37 a share, and Microsoft pulled the offer.\n\nYahoo closed down 4.56 percent at $21.54 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq. Microsoft shares were up 3.98 percent to $26.15, and Google shares slipped 1.06 percent to $516.09.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Chief Legal Officer David Drummond also defended the partnership with Yahoo and dismissed the idea that it would hurt competition in the Internet search market.\n\n\u201cGoogle and Yahoo will remain fierce competitors,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cThis agreement will not remove a competitor from the field.\u201d\n\nDrummond argued that any Microsoft deal with Yahoo would raise antitrust issues in the markets for display advertising, e-mail and instant messaging.\n\n\u201cThe most energetic critic of ours is Microsoft,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cnot exactly a mom-and-pop show.\u201d"

The LG box is expected to be available in the second half of the year.\n\nRumors of a partnership with Microsoft have swirled in the blogosphere since last year, when Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings joined Microsoft\u2019s board of directors and Netflix began surveying subscribers about their interest in accessing movies through an Xbox.\n\nNetflix has more than 8.2 million subscribers. Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Xbox consoles and offers limited movie rental through its Xbox Live subscription service.\n\nIt was not immediately clear on Monday how many Netflix subscribers own Xbox 360s and have Xbox Live Gold memberships.\n\nShares of Netflix were up 90 cents, or 3.3 percent, at $28.11 in afternoon Nasdaq trade."
