        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella kicked off one of the largest layoffs in tech history on Thursday, hoping to reshape the aging PC industry titan into a nimbler rival to Apple and Google, and jolt a culture at the company that is used to protecting its existing Windows and Office franchises.\n\nMicrosoft Corp said on Thursday it will slash up to 18,000 jobs, or 14 percent of its workforce, over the next 12 months as it almost halves the size of its newly acquired Nokia phone business and tries to become a cloud-computing and mobile-friendly software company.\n\nThe larger-than-expected cuts are the deepest in the software giant\u2019s 39-year history and come five months into Nadella\u2019s tenure.\n\nBeyond the Nokia reductions, Nadella gave few clues about where the ax will fall or what areas will receive more funding.\n\nOne source briefed on the cuts said a major victim would be the 175-strong Xbox Entertainment Studios unit, which will start to wind down efforts to create original content. But it will continue to work on its highest-profile project, a filmed version of the blockbuster \u2018Halo\u2019 videogame.\n\nNadella said he will answer questions from employees at a town hall meeting at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on Friday and flesh out his plans publicly after Microsoft\u2019s quarterly earnings report on July 22.\n\n\u201cWe will simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability, become more agile and move faster,\u201d Nadella wrote to employees in a memo made public early Thursday. \u201cWe plan to have fewer layers of management, both top down and sideways, to accelerate the flow of information and decision making.\u201d\n\nThe size of the cuts were welcomed by Wall Street, which was critical of the Nokia acquisition and viewed Microsoft as bloated under previous CEO Steve Ballmer, topping 127,000 in staff after absorbing Nokia earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis is about double what the Street was expecting,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. \u201cNadella is clearing the decks for the new fiscal year. He is cleaning up part of the mess that Ballmer left.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 1.8 percent to $44.88 on Nasdaq, reaching their highest since the technology stock boom of 2000.\n\nAbout 12,500 of the layoffs will come from eliminating overlaps with the Nokia unit, which Microsoft acquired in April for $7.2 billion, with the bulk of the cuts coming from Nokia itself. The acquisition of Nokia\u2019s handset business in April added 25,000 people to Microsoft\u2019s payroll.\n\nThe Nokia-related cuts were widely expected. When it struck the deal, Microsoft said it would cut $600 million per year in costs within 18 months of closing the acquisition.\n\nExcluding the Nokia cuts, the remaining 5,500 layoffs were not as shocking as it first appeared, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate number is still bigger than expected but it\u2019s not as big as it comes across,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of re-hiring in other areas of the business. On a net basis, the numbers are small.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s campus appears to have escaped heavy cuts, at least for now. The first wave of layoffs include 1,351 jobs in the Seattle region, Microsoft said.\n\nAbout 1,100 jobs will be cut from Nokia\u2019s original home country of Finland, according to government and union representatives there, with about half coming from the closure of its research and development operation in the northern city of Oulu.\n\nStephen Elop, the former CEO of Nokia who now runs Microsoft\u2019s devices unit, said phone engineering efforts will now be concentrated in Salo and Tampere, Finland, and it will reduce engineering work in Beijing and San Diego. He said phone manufacturing will be focused in Hanoi, Vietnam, with some production to continue in Beijing and Dongguan, China. Some Microsoft manufacturing and repair operations will be moved to Manaus, Brazil and Reynosa, Mexico, as it winds down operations in Komaron, Hungary.\n\nThe EU\u2019s employment commissioner said he has asked to meet with Microsoft to discuss the social impact of the layoffs.\n\nAs part of the integration of Nokia, Microsoft is abandoning its experiment in making phones powered by Google\u2019s Android system, moving some of its Nokia X line of phones onto Windows phone software.\n\nThe company said it expects to take pretax charges of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion over the next four quarters to account for the costs of the layoffs.\n\nNadella\u2019s cuts are the biggest at the Redmond, Washington-based company since Ballmer axed 5,800, or about 6 percent of headcount, in the depths of the recession in early 2009.\n\nThe new CEO\u2019s moves are designed to help Microsoft shift from being a primarily software-focused company to one that sells online services, apps and devices it hopes will make people and businesses more productive. Nadella needs to make Microsoft a stronger competitor to Google and Apple Inc, which have dominated the new era of mobile-centric computing.\n\nMarking this change of emphasis, Nadella last week rebranded Microsoft as \u201cthe productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft is not alone among the pioneers of the personal computer revolution now slimming down to adapt to the Web-focused world.\n\nPC-maker Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a radical three-to-five-year plan that will lop up to 50,000 from its staff of 250,000.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp is undergoing a \u201cworkforce rebalancing,\u201d which analysts say could mean 13,000, or about 3 percent of its staff, being laid off or transferred to new owners as units are sold.\n\nChipmaker Intel Corp and network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc both said in the past year they were cutting about 5 percent of their staff."

Yahoo recently picked up canceled NBC comedy \u201cCommunity\u201d for another season. And Sony features Jerry Seinfeld in \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d on its Crackle digital network."
