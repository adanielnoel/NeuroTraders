        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said a Web search advertising deal with Yahoo Inc makes economic sense and may still be possible, though the two sides are not in any discussions.\n\nShares of Yahoo jumped as much as 17 percent as investors hoped Ballmer\u2019s comments could lead to the two sides returning to the negotiating table. But gains were pared back to about 12 percent after Microsoft issued a statement saying it had no interest in buying Yahoo.\n\nTalks between the two broke off in July after Yahoo rejected Microsoft\u2019s proposal to buy its search advertising business and enact a revenue-sharing partnership.\n\nYahoo had also rebuffed in May a full acquisition bid from Microsoft that was priced at $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. Instead, Yahoo signed a search advertising pact with Web leader Google Inc, which is being scrutinized by regulators.\n\n\u201cPerhaps there will continue to remain opportunities to partner around search,\u201d Ballmer told a Gartner Inc conference in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\u201cWe are not in any discussions with them. We\u2019ll see. They want to remain independent. There are probably still opportunities around search. I think it would still make sense economically for their shareholders and ours.\u201d\n\nSince talks broke off, Yahoo shares have plunged to a 5-1/2-year low of $11.37, weighed by concerns over the outlook for Web display advertising, as major advertisers such as banks and automakers cut back spending.\n\n\u201cWe offered 33 bucks not too long ago and it\u2019s 11 and a half. So I don\u2019t know what price might have got the job done,\u201d Ballmer said, responding to a question from Gartner analyst David Smith on whether Microsoft might take another stab at buying Yahoo now that its stock price is so low.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Yahoo did not want to sell the company. It did not want to sell when we offered 33 ... They probably think it\u2019s worth at least 33 today.\u201d\n\nYahoo declined comment. Its shares rose to as high as $13.73 on Thursday, before settling at around $13.16 in late trading on the Nasdaq.\n\n\u201cOur position hasn\u2019t changed. Microsoft has no interest in acquiring Yahoo; there are no discussions between the companies,\u201d a spokesman for Microsoft said in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 3.6 percent at $23.48.\n\nDespite the market\u2019s excitement, any pursuit of new talks would be impeded by several issues, including Yahoo\u2019s severely depressed stock price and the poor outlook for the advertising market due to the weak economy, analysts said.\n\n\u201dThe larger issue is strategic fit,\u201c Cross Research analyst Richard Williams said. \u201dMicrosoft clearly has spent money and changed its focus to \u2018build\u2019 rather than \u2018buy.\u2019\n\nHe added that for businesses driven by advertising, such as Microsoft and Yahoo\u2019s Internet operations, it is the wrong time for a deal with markets reeling and consumer confidence plummeting.\n\n\u201cGoing into a recession is about the worst time to buy an advertising firm,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how hard they are going to be hit and how low they are going to go.\u201d"
