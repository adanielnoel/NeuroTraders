        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen said on Thursday he would increase his total donations to organizations tackling Ebola to more than $100 million, making him one of the biggest personal donors in the fight against the virus.\n\nThe Seattle man, who co-founded what became the world\u2019s biggest software company with Bill Gates in 1975, had already donated $9 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fight Ebola in September.\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, Allen said he was committed to giving \u201cat least $100 million\u201d to the cause through various channels.\n\nThat includes funding medical evacuation containment units for medics who become infected, to be used by the U.S. State Department, and funding the University of Massachusetts Medical School to train medics and provide supplies for relief efforts in Liberia.\n\n\u201cThe Ebola virus is unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced and needs a response unlike anything we have ever seen,\u201d Allen said in his statement."

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact.\n\nThe results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master.\n\nMicrosoft shares, which have climbed 33 percent over the past year, rose another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $46.36.\n\n\u201cIn light of recent negative earnings results from tech bellwethers Oracle, IBM, SAP, VMware, and EMC, Microsoft is bucking the trend and we would label these September results as a solid accomplishment,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.\n\nInvestors were keenly watching Microsoft after harsh warnings from International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and SAP (SAPG.DE) about operating profits as they make tentative inroads into the cloud, which generally yields thinner margins than technology companies are used to.\n\nMicrosoft did not disclose its cloud-based revenue for the fiscal first quarter, but said commercial cloud sales rose 128 percent, while sales of services based on its Azure cloud platform rose 121 percent.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, it said gross profit margin in the unit that includes Azure rose 194 percent, despite rising infrastructure costs, which includes the huge expense of building and operating datacenters.\n\nIn the last four years, Microsoft\u2019s gross profit margin has drifted down to about 65 percent from above 80 percent, largely due to its move into the less profitable business of making tablets and phones, but accelerated by the move to the cloud.\n\nNomura analyst Rick Sherlund figures Microsoft is on track to hit $6 billion a year in cloud revenue soon, which would make it the industry\u2019s largest cloud vendor by his calculations. That represents only about 6 percent of overall expected revenue this fiscal year, but investors are highly sensitive to a business they see as key to the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple digit rates,\u201d said Satya Nadella, on a conference call with analysts.\n\nNadella was keen to stress that Microsoft is more focused on selling higher-margin services via the cloud to its commercial customers rather than just storage and computing power. \u201cOur premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, fast analytics, and enterprise mobility,\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s fiscal first-quarter profit actually fell 13 percent, largely due to an expected $1.1 billion charge related to mass layoffs announced in July, which lopped 11 cents per share off earnings.\n\nIncluding that charge, the world\u2019s largest software company reported profit of $4.5 billion, or 54 cents per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStill, it easily beat Wall Street\u2019s forecast of 49 cents per share, including the charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe charge resulted from Microsoft\u2019s plan, launched in July, to cut 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, with most of those cuts coming from its newly acquired Nokia phone business.\n\nRevenue rose 25 percent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, handily exceeding analysts\u2019 average estimate of $22 billion.\n\nSales of its Lumia smartphones hit 9.3 million in the first full quarter since the close of the Nokia deal. Sales of the Surface tablet more than doubled to $908 million from $400 million in the year-ago quarter."
