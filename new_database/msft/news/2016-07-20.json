        "body": "(Reuters) - Sharp growth in its commercial cloud computing business helped lift Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) quarterly revenue above Wall Street\u2019s expectations, sending the technology company\u2019s shares up more than 4 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nThe new and growing cloud business - essentially selling computing services and storage in its data centers to corporate customers - is one of the priorities for Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who took the helm of the world\u2019s largest software company in early 2014\n\nNadella has refocused the company on cloud and mobile in the face of stagnation in its traditional PC-based Windows business.\n\n\u201cOnly two companies are setting the tone of enterprise computing, Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS,\u201d said Trip Chowdhry, managing director of Global Equities Research, referring to Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) web services unit.\n\n\u201dThese are the only two initiators in the whole enterprise space that are going to see growth in excess of 80 percent year-over-year for at least two or three years.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue in what it calls its \u201cintelligent cloud\u201d businesses, which includes the Azure cloud platform and server software, rose 7 percent to $6.7 billion.\n\nRevenue for Azure - which customers can use to host their website, apps or data - grew 102 percent, but Microsoft did not say what the actual revenue figure was.\n\nThat makes an annual \u201crun rate\u201d of $12.1 billion for cloud-related revenue, up sharply from over $8 billion a year ago. Microsoft calculates run rate by multiplying revenue in the final month of the quarter for its cloud businesses by 12.\n\nDespite the surge in revenue, Microsoft is still struggling to increase profit in the capital-intensive cloud business. It said operating profit in its intelligent cloud businesses fell 17 percent to $2.19 billion in the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft said the drop was mainly due to higher research, development, sales and marketing costs, as it makes investments and acquisitions to \u201cdrive cloud sales capacity and innovation.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft posted revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, adjusted for some one-time items, of $22.6 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago. That beat Wall Street\u2019s average forecast of $22.1 billion.\n\nIt reported net income of $3.1 billion, or 39 cents per share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. In the year-ago quarter it took a $7.5 billion charge to write down the value of its purchase of Nokia\u2019s handset business.\n\nExcluding one-time items in the latest quarter, Microsoft reported earnings of 69 cents per share. That was ahead of analysts\u2019 average forecast of 58 cents.\n\nSanford Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler said Microsoft is finally making headway shifting Microsoft Office software clients onto subscription-based cloud services. Office consumer products and cloud services were up 19 percent and Office 365 increased subscribers to 23.1 million during the quarter.\n\n\u201cPeople looked at Office as a product that was going to be in decline,\u201d said Moerdler. \u201cWe saw a dip, last quarter we came out of that dip, and now we\u2019re accelerating out of the dip.\u201d\n\nNadella, who announced the company\u2019s largest-ever deal last month, striking a deal to pay $26.2 billion for LinkedIn Corp LNKD.N, has staked Microsoft\u2019s future on mobile and the cloud.\n\nSo far his plan has been well received by investors. Microsoft shares are up 64 percent since his predecessor as CEO Steve Ballmer announced his plan to retire, in August 2013. The S&P 500 is up 31 percent in the same time.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 4.35 percent at $55.40 in extended trading on Tuesday."
