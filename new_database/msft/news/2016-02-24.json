        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - An explosion so strong some people thought it was an earthquake leveled a mobile home in western Washington state on Tuesday, possibly trapping two residents and shattering windows at a nearby elementary school, authorities said.\n\n\u201cThe force of this explosion basically turned everything into popsicle sticks,\u201d said Kitsap County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Scott Wilson, referring to the leveled triple-wide mobile home. \u201cThere is not much left, it\u2019s just debris.\u201d\n\nLocal media said some area residents thought they were witnessing an earthquake.\n\nAuthorities led by a cadaver dog were searching for two residents who may have been trapped inside the home, which also caught fire after the explosion, Wilson said. No bodies have been found.\n\nEmergency officials were working to determine the cause of the early-morning blast, which rocked the area of Port Orchard, some 20 miles west of Seattle, Wilson said.\n\nThe force of the explosion shattered windows at Mullenix Ridge Elementary, which borders the residential property, Wilson said. School officials were repairing the damage, though classes were expected to carry on normally.\n\nAgents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were assisting in the investigation, said Kent Plemons, an official in the agency\u2019s Seattle office.\n\nFirefighters could be seen spraying water on smoldering debris, a photo posted on the South Kitsap Fire and Rescue Facebook page showed.\n\n\u201cThe danger is over,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the cleanup and determining whether anybody is in the house.\u201d"
