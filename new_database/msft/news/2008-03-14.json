        "body": "NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - When CNN wanted to interview vacationing analyst Jeffrey Toobin about the Eliot Spitzer sex scandal, it used a videophone service that has made its name on free calls between friends and family members.\n\nToobin, who went to Harvard Law School with the disgraced New York governor, appeared via telephone Monday from Maui to contribute to the coverage. For the second day, CNN executives wanted to use a video feed but were stymied by the fact that they didn\u2019t have the equipment to make it happen.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to take this guy and his family away from vacation and send him to Oahu (where there would be other facilities),\u201d CNN senior vp David Bohrman said. \u201cI thought it would have been really annoying.\u201d\n\nLooking for another way, CNN\u2019s tech staff and producers discovered that some technicians had been experimenting with a feed from Skype, the eBay-owned videophone service that offers free voice and webcam calls over the Internet.\n\n\u201cThey had done a bunch of tests and were itching to try it,\u201d Bohrman said. \u201cNo one had ever done it, as far as they knew.\u201d\n\nUsing a laptop computer and webcam borrowed from the business center of the hotel where he and his family were staying, Toobin set up a makeshift studio overlooking poolside.\n\nBohrman said he was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the video. It didn\u2019t make \u201cThe Situation Room,\u201d but an interview was featured in CNN\u2019s primetime political programming, and Toobin later took part in a roundtable discussion on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d CNN called Toobin\u2019s cell phone with the audio feed, and he used his cell phone earpiece to hear what was going on.\n\n\u201cOther than that the lighting wasn\u2019t perfect, it worked really well,\u201d Bohrman said. \u201cIt looked as good or better than the broadband with more complex technology.\u201d\n\nOther networks use broadband technology and, in some cases, Treo or cell phone video for live reports. Fox News Channel used live video from a cell phone for Spitzer\u2019s initial news conference when no one else was able to provide live video. Fox News Channel regularly uses VoIP technology, notably in its mobile election units. MSNBC\u2019s campaign embeds and correspondent Lee Cowan use ComVue video technology to file live reports.\n\nA Fox TV affiliate, WBRC-TV in Birmingham, Ala., used Skype last year to file live reports from a tornado scene.\n\nCNN U.S. president Jon Klein said the use of the Skype videophone is another advance that boosts the news product.\n\n\u201cIt enables us to cover the news in more places and less expensive than ever before,\u201d Klein said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. The end result is more information for the viewers.\u201d"
