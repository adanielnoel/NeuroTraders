        "body": "NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday, with technology shares set to gain after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) raised its profit outlook, but record oil prices could weigh on the broad market.\n\nS&P and Dow futures were down slightly, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose.\n\nMicrosoft lifted its full-year forecasts after the close on Thursday and posted quarterly profit that beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nBut in other earnings news, Waste Management Inc WMI.N, the largest U.S. trash hauler, posted results that missed estimates.\n\nAlso weighing on sentiment was oil\u2019s rise to a record high of $92.22 a barrel. U.S. crude futures later pared gains to $91.29 in electronic trading.\n\n\u201cEven though Microsoft\u2019s earnings were good, the financial sector has been weak,\u201d said Peter Dunay, investment strategist at Leeb Capital Management in New York. \u201cWhat concerns me is the forward-looking guidance in financials.\u201d\n\nDunay added, \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore oil pushing to new highs every day. That\u2019s a big increase in energy prices for the consumer.\u201d\n\nS&P 500 futures SPc1 were down 1.80 points but still above fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.\n\nMerrill Lynch & Co. MER.N shares rose before the opening bell after news Chief Executive Stan O\u2018Neal met with Wachovia Corp. WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, about a merger but without first obtaining his board\u2019s approval. Shares of Merrill rose 1.8 percent to $61.99 after the report in The New York Times. For details, see [ID:nL26620794].\n\nThe news came two days after Merrill\u2019s quarterly results, which included $7.9 billion in write-downs for bad investments related to risky subprime mortgages.\n\nCountrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N shares rose 12.5 percent to $14.70 before the bell after the lender reported quaterly results and said it negotiated additional liquidity.\n\nIn other news, Merrill Lynch raised its rating on Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N), according to theflyonthewall.com.\n\nIn after-hours trading, Microsoft\u2019s stock rose about 5 percent to $33.50. In the regular session it set a new 52-week high of $32.22.\n\nData on Friday includes the Reuters/University of Michigan final reading of consumer sentiment for October, which is expected to show Americans were less optimistic about the economic outlook this month.\n\nU.S. stocks fell on Thursday after disappointing results from Comcast (CMCSA.O) and engine maker Cummins (CMI.N) fed worries about corporate profits, while fears of more credit losses hit financial shares."

        "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has made progress in getting its Windows software to work on a low-cost laptop computer for poor children that currently runs on rival Linux software, an executive said on Thursday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software company is now working to adapt a basic version of Windows XP so it is compatible with the nonprofit One Laptop per Child Foundation\u2019s small green-and-white XO laptop.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending a nontrivial amount of money on it,\u201d Microsoft Corporate Vice President Will Poole said in an interview on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe remain hopeful with our progress to date, we still have significant work ahead to finalize our analysis and testing processes,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s no guarantees.\u201d\n\nThe One Laptop per Child Foundation, a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, plans to start producing the $188 machines in China next month and eventually manufacture millions a year for elementary school children in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe foundation is also selling the machines in the United States and Canada for $400 apiece through a fund-raising campaign.\n\nThe laptops were designed specifically to run Linux programs. If the machines run only Linux, Microsoft will lose an opportunity to expose tens of millions of children worldwide to its Windows system.\n\nIf the foundation is able to meet its goal of producing millions of laptops for school children around the world and they are all loaded with Linux software, then they would end up being more comfortable with those programs than with Windows, said Wayan Vota, who publishes a blog that monitors the project. (olpcnews.com/).\n\n\u201dPeople will realize there is an alternative to Windows and they might like it better,\u201c Vota said.\u201d\n\nBut the new laptop uses some technologies developed by the foundation that haven\u2019t previously been used in personal computers, Poole said.\n\n\u201cWe still have plenty of work to do in determining if the highly constrained performance, power, and memory in the first generation XO laptops will be compatible with Windows and popular Windows applications,\u201d he added.\n\nOriginally dubbed the $100 laptop, which is the group\u2019s target price for the machine, the XO features a string pulley to charge its battery, a keyboard that switches between languages, a digital video camera and wireless connectivity.\n\nThe laptop\u2019s designer, Mary Lou Jepsen, said in an interview earlier this month she expects the price to drop in the first quarter of next year because prices of memory tend to fall dramatically during that period.\n\nThe computer requires just 2 watts of power compared with the typical laptop\u2019s 30 to 40 watts and does away with hard drives, relying instead on flash memory and four USB ports to add memory devices.\n\nThe XO laptop\u2019s component makers include Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Software maker Red Hat Inc helped develop the device. Quanta Computer Inc will manufacture it.\n\nThe foundation will start taking orders for its Give 1 Get 1 campaign on November 12 at www.laptopgiving.org."

        "body": "SEATTLE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - More than a year ago, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer stood in front a group of skeptical Wall Street analysts and insisted that the software maker was still a growth company.\n\nIt was a bold statement at the time. Microsoft was suffering delays in releasing an update to its flagship Windows operating system and its stock had slumped to around $24, the lower end of a range it had drifted in for about four years.\n\nMicrosoft delivered strong results on Thursday that justified some of Ballmer\u2019s optimism for continued growth in its main software lines while buying the company time with investors to build out newer ventures like online advertising and video games.\n\nThe stock, already up 10 percent in the last month, surged to $35.57 in after-hours trade, up nearly 14 percent from Wednesday\u2019s close and its highest level since 2001.\n\n\u201cBallmer went out on the limb, because it did look like a very silly statement that not only Microsoft was a growth story but that PC operating systems were still a growth story,\u201d said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group recalling the financial analyst meeting in July 2006.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is a good foundation for growth.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft blew past Wall Street estimates with profit and revenue growth exceeding 20 percent for the just-ended quarter and raised its full-year revenue and earnings outlook with a solid performance across its range of businesses.\n\n\u201cIt looks really strong across the board. It\u2019s hard not to like what you see,\u201d said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager for Jensen Portfolio.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said the company defied the \u201claw of large numbers\u201d -- it\u2019s harder for big companies to grow -- by posting the fastest start to its year since 1999 when its stock hit an all-time high near $60.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s growth still does not match the dizzying climb at Google Inc. (GOOG.O) or the iPod-led resurgence at Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) but the share\u2019s sharp gain after the results is a sign that investors are taking a second look at the company.\n\nBased on the top-end of Microsoft\u2019s own earnings estimate range for fiscal 2008, the stock traded at around 20 times earnings in after-hours trade. By comparison, Google trades at 32 times analysts\u2019 estimated 2008 earnings and Apple is at 37 times.\n\n\u201cWe think that this is a $40 stock, $40-plus, so we think finally Microsoft is getting recognition for what it\u2019s doing,\u201d said Caughey from Fort Pitt Capital, which oversees more than $1 billion including Microsoft shares for clients.\n\nThe Windows and Office units delivered revenue growth of more than 20 percent, a sign that businesses and consumers are starting to upgrade to Windows Vista and Office 2007, the latest versions of the two software franchises.\n\nWindows and Office are the two pillars of Microsoft\u2019s business. Those traditional desktop software businesses are also considered the most vulnerable to competitors looking to deliver software over the Internet as a service.\n\nProfits from those high-margin businesses during upgrade cycles can be invested into new, high-growth initiatives. It\u2019s the same strategy Microsoft used to give birth to its computer server software business and entertainment division.\n\nMicrosoft is not entirely out of the woods.\n\nIts online services business posted a fifth straight quarterly loss and the jury is still out on whether its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive will pay off.\n\nThe company showed its desperation to become a major force in online advertising when it agreed to buy a stake in social networking Web site Facebook for a valuation not seen since the height of the dot-com frenzy in the late 1990s.\n\nMicrosoft also lags behind Google and Yahoo Inc. YHOO.O in Web search, the most profitable portion of the online advertising market, and improvements to the search engine\u2019s look and technology have done little to bridge the gap.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s entertainment and devices division swung to a profit in the September quarter thanks to sales of blockbuster video game title \u201cHalo 3,\u201d but the unit is still three months removed from a $1.06 billion charge to fix hardware problems with the Xbox 360.\n\nThe division has predicted that it will turn an annual profit for the first time in the segment\u2019s history."
