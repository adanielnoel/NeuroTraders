Microsoft is the largest holding of the $62 million Becker Value Equity Fund.\n\nLast month, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer confirmed what most investors already suspected: the world\u2019s largest software maker is not immune to the economic downturn gripping the industry.\n\nWall Street is already bracing for Microsoft to fall short of expectations in fiscal 2009 or come in at the low-end of the forecast range that it issued in July.\n\nAccording to Reuters Estimates, analysts on average expect fiscal 2009 earnings of $2.12 per share -- the bottom of Microsoft\u2019s own forecast range of between $2.12 and $2.18 per share. Wall Street sees revenue at $66.7 billion, below the company\u2019s estimated range of $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has long pushed the idea that its products make up a small but essential part of corporate technology spending and that its software and its markets are diverse and not overly exposed to any one area.\n\nHowever, many investors expect the current financial crisis to run longer and cause a deeper economic downturn than any in recent memory.\n\nMcAdams Wright Ragen analyst Sid Parakh, who has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Microsoft, said a spending slowdown could hit personal computer sales, which are closely coupled with revenue at the company\u2019s Windows business.\n\n\u201cConsidering the turbulence in the financial markets as well as increased caution over the global economic outlook, we expect customers to pull back on IT spending,\u201d Parakh wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nIn the September quarter, worldwide PC shipments remained strong, rising 15 percent from a year ago, driven by demand outside of North America for lower-cost laptops.\n\nSemiconductor giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) also provided some comfort to technology investors, posting a 12 percent profit rise for the September quarter and beating expectations. It issued a conservative -- but not awful -- outlook.\n\nResilient PC demand and new product launches from its computer server business bodes well for Microsoft\u2019s earnings from the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts expect profit to rise about 3 percent, to 47 cents per share, on an 8 percent rise in revenue to $14.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nWall Street is forecasting earnings per share of 55 cents in the current quarter on revenue of $18 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nThe December quarter is usually known for being a busy period for Microsoft\u2019s entertainment and devices division as consumers snap up Xbox 360 consoles and video game titles during the holiday shopping season.\n\nThe company cut Xbox 360 prices in September, lowering the price of its entry-level console to below $200 -- a key mass-market price level that Microsoft has said historically accounted for more than 75 percent of all machine sales.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we are going to have a really difficult holiday season with the U.S. consumer pulling back a lot. So the Xbox business might be weak going forward,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.\n\nMicrosoft shares have fallen about 10 percent since the company last reported results on July 17. The stock has fared better than the broader market with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down more than 20 percent during that period.\n\nMicrosoft shares touched an eight-year low at $20.65 on Oct. 10, but it has clawed back to above $24 since then."
