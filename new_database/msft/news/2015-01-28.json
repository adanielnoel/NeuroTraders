        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Investors wiped $35 billion off Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) market value on Tuesday without any clear-cut, single explanation.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software company, whose shares had climbed about 30 percent over the past 12 months to near 15-year highs, instead worried investors with a series of troubling signals in its earnings report and conference call on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe results weren\u2019t that bad,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ. \u201cWhat really struck people was that it wasn\u2019t just one thing and it wasn\u2019t just a handful of things that had obvious or easy fixes.\u201d\n\nThe panoply of Microsoft\u2019s problems included an unexpectedly soggy PC market after a buying rush sparked by the end of Windows XP, an ongoing dip in companies\u2019 spending on Office software, problems in Japan and China and a strong U.S. dollar eating away at the value of its huge overseas revenues.\n\nInvestors were aware of most of those issues before Monday, but the combination of concerns pushed Microsoft\u2019s stock down 9.25 percent to $42.66, its biggest one day fall since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over last February.\n\nUntil Tuesday, Nadella had enjoyed fanatical support from investors, who lapped up his plan to redesign Microsoft as a leader in cloud and mobile computing.\n\nThere are now signs that investors are more skeptical of how quickly Nadella can drag the PC-based titan into the mobile world.\n\n\u201cThey made a splash with Office for iPad, but it remains to be seen to what extent they are really going to be able to pull through substantial percentages of their legacy applications business to the cloud,\u201d said Kessler.\n\nSome investors feel Microsoft is not helping itself in how it explains the financial effects of its move into the cloud, for example shifting Office customers from installed versions to the cloud-powered online version called Office 365.\n\nMicrosoft discloses revenue in broad business groups, but does not give out concrete user numbers or revenue figures for some of the cloud businesses investors want to know the most about.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d probably serve themselves better if they were able to tease out the detail and demonstrate how strong that transition to the cloud is,\u201d said Kevin Walkush, an analyst at Jensen Investment Management. \u201cRight now people are just guessing, and when you leave it to people to guess, they are going to project the worst. It\u2019s a frustration for me as an investor.\u201d"

        "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent lower on Tuesday as disappointing results from a number of bellwether companies pointed to weakening conditions, while an unexpected decline in durable goods orders also weighed on sentiment.\n\nThe day\u2019s losses were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors lower on the day, though tech was the biggest drag by far. The group lost 3.3 percent in its biggest one-day drop since November 2011, in the wake of results from industry bellwether Microsoft. Industrial shares fell, led by Caterpillar.\n\nThe two names were the biggest decliners on the Dow, but fellow components Procter & Gable and DuPont Co also tumbled.\n\nMicrosoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning.\n\nHeavy machinery marker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, warning that the recent plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Shares dropped 7.2 percent to $79.85.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly a lot of froth baked into certain areas of tech, while Caterpillar is giving tangible evidence that things can go down more than they already have,\u201d said Jim O\u2018Donnell, chief investment officer at Forward in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cPeople may not be aware of the sensitivities that heavy industrial guys have to the oil cycle, or what the ripple effects of oil\u2019s weakness will be. There are a lot of companies that are going to be adversely impacted.\u201d\n\nWith 24 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, 70.6 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations while 55.5 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue.\n\nMany multinational companies disappointed this quarter, with the stronger dollar a common culprit. P&G was one of the companies pressured by a stronger dollar, sending shares down 3.4 percent to $86.49.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 291.49 points, or 1.65 percent, to 17,387.21, the S&P 500 lost 27.54 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,029.55 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 90.27 points, or 1.89 percent, to 4,681.50.\n\nAdding to the day\u2019s weakness, a gauge of U.S. business investment plans unexpectedly fell in December, another sign that slowing global growth and falling crude oil prices were having an impact on the economy.\n\nOn the plus side, consumer confidence posted its highest reading since August 2007. That helped indexes recover from their lows of the session; the Dow earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,726 to 1,337, for a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,710 issues fell and 1,029 advanced, for a 1.66-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 49 new lows.
