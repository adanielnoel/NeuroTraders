        "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) launch of its first new operating system in almost three years, designed to work across laptops, desktop and smartphones, won mostly positive reviews for its user-friendly and feature-packed interface.\n\nThe launch was seen critical for the company, particularly after the poor response to Windows 8, an ambitious redesign that confused many users by ditching the start button menu and introducing a new layout.\n\nThe new OS, launched on Wednesday, will be available as a free upgrade for users of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.\n\nWall Street Journal\u2019s Geoffrey Fowler said Windows 10 fixes most of the issues with Windows 8 and improves on Windows 7, Microsoft\u2019s most popular OS in recent years.\n\nFor one, the start button is back.\n\n\u201cThree months of testing Windows 10 determined that this familiar yet fresh overhaul far outweighs any problems,\u201d Fowler wrote in his review.\n\nBy offering free upgrades, Microsoft aims to put the system on as many devices as possible. The company would then make up for any lost revenue by selling services such as Office over the Internet, or cloud.\n\nFBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said the cloud strategy could generate a new revenue stream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction. They went back to their core DNA around software and a cloud-centric model and ultimately Windows as a service, a subscription model,\u201d Ives told Reuters.\n\nMicrosoft, which unveiled Windows 10 in September, skipped Windows 9 altogether, to put some distance between the new system and Windows 8.\n\nAt least one prominent reviewer was skeptical, saying the new OS was unlikely to boost PC sales or salvage Microsoft\u2019s Windows phone business.\n\nRe/code\u2019s Walt Mossberg said some features were promising but the new OS was \u201csurprisingly buggy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI doubt it will convert many Mac owners, spur a shopping spree in new PCs, bring in droves of new developers, or save the Windows Phone,\u201d Mossberg wrote.\n\nAlmost all critics lauded the return of the Start button.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t start a review of Windows 10 without heralding the return of the Start menu,\u201d USA Today\u2019s Edward Baig wrote\n\n\u201cThe newly revamped Start menu in Windows 10 is a useful combination of Windows past and present and a metaphor for the entire direction of Windows 10,\u201d .\n\nWindows 10 also comes equipped with \u2018Cortana\u2019, a digital assistant similar to Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) Siri and Google Inc\u2019s (GOOG.O) Now."
