        "body": "NEW YORK (Billboard) - While most of its \u201880s electro-pop contemporaries have faded into semi-obscurity, Depeche Mode continues to produce darkly atmospheric tracks about love, lust and death that have the vulnerability and immediacy of a shared secret.\n\nThe chirps and bleeps that marked the band\u2019s debut, \u201cSpeak & Spell,\u201d gradually gave way to emotionally raw, expansive songs under the guidance of songwriter Martin Gore. After nearly 30 years, the trio -- now comprising Gore, Dave Gahan and Andrew Fletcher -- still imbues every aspect of its 12th studio album, \u201cSounds of the Universe,\u201d with imagery and sonic flourishes that make its music fresh and familiar. \u201cCorrupt\u201d and \u201cWrong\u201d wouldn\u2019t be out of place on \u201cViolator\u201d or \u201cMusic for the Masses\u201d; they possess the taut, Gothic glamour of those albums. Gahan handles provocative lyrics with his usual swagger. Some of the album\u2019s less successful songs -- \u201cLittle Soul,\u201d for example -- are also its sunniest and most languorous, and lack the dramatic tension that has been Depeche Mode\u2019s calling card. Despite the departure of Alan Wilder in 2005 and tales of intraband combustibility, \u201cSounds of the Universe\u201d captures an act with enough passion and inspiration to teach the artists it has influenced a few new tricks.\n\nAlthough the roster of the newly formed act Tinted Windows is a bit of a head-scratcher -- middle Hanson brother Taylor Hanson, Fountains of Wayne\u2019s Adam Schlesinger, former Smashing Pumpkin James Iha and Cheap Trick drummer Bun E. Carlos -- it all seems to make sense after one listen to the supergroup\u2019s self-titled debut. \u201cWhoa whoa\u201d and \u201ccome on, come on\u201d choruses abound on a set that\u2019s packed with radio-ready pop tunes that will stick in your brain for days. The power-pop punch of songs like \u201cKind of a Girl,\u201d \u201cMessing With My Head\u201d and \u201cTake Me Back\u201d make up for the girl-woes lyrics that leave much to be desired (\u201cSince you said goodbye/I just want to die\u201d), while the cool, laid-back vibe of \u201cCha Cha\u201d and the open-wide chorus of \u201cNothing to Me\u201d set the perfect soundtrack to summer.\n\nIn a year that already has seen several overdue comebacks -- among them folkie Tom Rush, erstwhile Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and MG\u2019s founder Booker T. Jones -- legendary songwriter Jesse Winchester\u2019s may prove the most significant. Since the late \u201870s the author of such classics as \u201cThe Brand New Tennessee Waltz\u201d and \u201cBiloxi\u201d has averaged about one studio album per decade (his last was 1999\u2019s \u201cGentleman of Leisure\u201d), which makes the arrival of \u201cLove Filling Station\u201d reason to celebrate. Recorded in Nashville and abetted by some estimable talent (including Jerry Douglas on lap steel), it swings easily between country/pop material like the sentimental, \u201850s-ish \u201cO What a Thrill\u201d (previously covered by the Mavericks) and the jaunty, Western swing-flavored \u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Him,\u201d plus a handful of well-chosen covers, notably Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand by Me.\u201d Throughout, Winchester\u2019s keening upper register remains as delicious as a honey-coated confection, while the occasional raspy inflection conveys a touch-of-gray elegance.\n\nFirst things first: \u201cMoving Forward,\u201d the second album by former New York Yankees centerfielder Bernie Williams, is the product of a musician with real chops, not a celebrity dilettante. Once again, the guitarist serves up a pleasing mix of light jazz and pop numbers, including a remake of Jon Secada\u2019s 1992 hit \u201cJust Another Day,\u201d with Secada himself on lead vocals; the pretty instrumental title track; and \u201cGo for It,\u201d featuring the jazz guitarist Mike Stern. Williams is a committed student of his instrument, but he\u2019s also savvy enough to cater to his tri-state area Yankee fan base, giving them a lovely version of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\u201d and a recording of Bruce Springsteen performing \u201cGlory Days\u201d at a charity benefit, with Williams on lead acoustic. But while the Springsteen track will help move a few more copies, it\u2019s an awkward way to end an album that otherwise keeps the spotlight properly trained on Williams himself.\n\nALBUM: OUT OF THE WILDERNESS (Quarter 2 Three Records)\n\nThere\u2019s no better purveyor of the swampy waters of roots music today than pianist-songwriter Robert Bradley. He and his band Blackwater Surprise mark their studio return after a six-year absence with the agreeably soulful \u201cOut of the Wilderness.\u201d It\u2019s his fifth outing since 1994, when the blind busker was plucked off Detroit\u2019s streets to document his rough-hewn tunes teeming with homespun lyrical acumen. Reunited with keyboardist Bruce Robb, who produced 2003\u2019s \u201cStill Lovin\u2019 You,\u201d Bradley brightens the CD with his effervescence, grooved choruses and gravelly voice, reminiscent of James Blood Ulmer. He pays homage to his home state on the country-inflected \u201cAlabama\u201d; gives it up to Ray Charles on the \u201cShaft\u201d-like, reggae-tinged \u201cAmericaland\u201d; and dances through the R&B and rock of \u201cEverybody Wanna Party,\u201d a perfect summer anthem. There\u2019s not a moment of contrivance, just pure, spirited fun.\n\nSince its release in Mexico last year, \u201cReptilectric\u201d hasn\u2019t strayed far from the top of the Mexican album charts, for good reason. Zoe stands out among its peers in the Latin alternative scene, thanks to darkly sophisticated songwriting and epic mixtures of the acoustic and electronic. The act evokes a Ziggy Stardust-like theme of an isolated pod of a human floating across space, though one who\u2019s looking to connect through signals and satellites. With the help of the noted British producer Phil Vinall, Zoe has created music to match its lofty concepts. Standouts include the title track, with its crashing guitar and lonely piano, and \u201cUltimos Dias,\u201d an uptempo tune with soaring new wave synths.\n\nThe English rock act Art Brut has established itself as the class clown of the indie scene, creating lightweight punk songs with a sarcastic edge. For the band\u2019s third effort, it recruited illustrious Pixies frontman Black Francis as its producer and decided to get (a bit) serious. \u201cArt Brut vs. Satan\u201d finds singer Eddie Argos battling many demons, from a hangover on \u201cAlcoholics Unanimous\u201d to an awkward morning-after on \u201cWhat a Rush.\u201d While Argos\u2019 shout-singing retains its comic charm, the band\u2019s songwriting has evolved since the two-minute headbangers of its 2005 debut, \u201cBang Bang Rock & Roll.\u201d The seven-minute closer, \u201cMysterious Bruises,\u201d is Art Brut\u2019s most ambitious song to date, and a funky guitar hook and thoughtful lyrics make it a highlight. Francis\u2019 production has noticeably tightened the band\u2019s sound, as Freddy Feedback\u2019s bass bounces crisply alongside dueling riffs. Art Brut may never shed its screwball charisma, but \u201cSatan\u201d is a successful step in a mature direction.\n\nBuilding sonic bridges between the past and the future, hip-hop has steadily sampled its way from trendy fad to global force. Playing a major role in that transition: the venerable Memphis label Stax Records. Its deep well of soul, R&B and funk courses throughout the work of such forward-thinking rap/hip-hop acts and producers as Public Enemy, Ice Cube, DJ Quik and DJ Hi-Tek. Featuring classic and little-known tracks by Isaac Hayes, David Porter, the Emotions and others, this 14-track collection doubles as a fascinating aural history demonstrating how the past inspired the hip-hop generation. One example is the Dramatics\u2019 1971 song \u201cGet Up and Get Down,\u201d which has been sampled by a diverse lineup ranging from LL Cool J, N.W.A and Redman to Raekwon featuring Ghostface Killah -- proof positive that old school can still be cool."

EU member states have already agreed on the move informally."

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday a version of its long awaited Windows 7 operating system will be made available from next week.\n\nThe version, known as a \u2018release candidate\u2019, or RC, essentially means the world\u2019s largest software company is in the final stages of completing the operating system, the successor to the unpopular Windows Vista.\n\nMicrosoft said the RC will be available for download by program developers and IT professionals subscribing to the MSDN and TechNet networks on April 30 and available more broadly on May 5.\n\nThe company has still not said when the finished version would begin to be installed on PCs or available to buy in shops, but the company\u2019s chief financial officer said on Thursday it could be as early as July.\n\nThat would allow Microsoft to capitalize on back-to-school sales and set it up for a strong holiday shopping season.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s operating systems, installed on the vast majority of the world\u2019s PCs, are still the backbone of the company, providing more than half of its $4.4 billion profit last quarter.\n\nVista, launched to the public in 2007, was incompatible with some low-power machines and perceived by many to be too complicated. Rival Apple Inc ridiculed Microsoft\u2019s problems with the system in a series of popular TV ads.\n\nWindows 7, which has been getting good reviews in limited public tests over the last few months, is much cleaner looking and features an array of new touch-screen functions. Microsoft says it will also interact better with digital cameras and music players."
