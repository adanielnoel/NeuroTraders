        "body": "Not only Microsoft is celebrating the launch of Windows 7 with some new ads, but Apple is also taking a stab at the introduction of the new OS, in its usual deprecating manner.\n\nMicrosoft on Thursday introduced to the world the new Windows 7 operating system, which despite mixed reviews, is set to break retail records. To celebrate, Microsoft also launched new a new Windows 7 ad.\n\nThe \u2018My Idea\u201d ad for Windows 7 presents a series of PC users who talk about how they wanted an easier OS, with less clicks and more speed. The ad is less patronizing than previous ones and is a step ahead of the Laptop Hunters series, which took a stab at Apple\u2019s expensive hardware; and it even has a naughty word at 00.17.\n\nGiven that everybody is talking about Windows 7 this week, Apple tried to steal Microsoft\u2019s launch aura, first by introducing new hardware on Tuesday and then with a three-ad series taking the ridiculing Windows 7 on Thursday.\n\nThe first ad, \u201cBroken Promises,\u201d ridicules Microsoft\u2019s promise that Windows 7 will be better than Vista, echoing previous statements for Windows XP, ME, and way back to Windows 2. The PC character even has his hair back towards the end of the ad.\n\nApple\u2019s \u2018Teeter Tottering\u2019 ad shows a Windows XP user ready to switch to a Mac, because Windows 7 requires a fresh start anyway. The PC character tries to sway her way, but in the end, as expected, the Mac wins.\n\nThe last Apple ad is titled \u201cPC News\u201d and shows the PC character as a news anchor, going live to what it turns out to be a bunch of Mac switchers. This makes the PC try to cut to commercials, even though the Mac character points out that this actually is a commercial.\n\nWe have yet to see whether Microsoft will come up with different ads that will attack Apple again, but it sure looks like Apple is not backing down -- especially as it wasn\u2019t very happy about the Laptop Hunters campaign."

        "body": "Windows 7 is finally here. The sun can shine and the birds can chirp. Ding dong, Windows Vista is dead! Perhaps that is a bit premature. Windows 7 hasn\u2019t been officially released for 24 hours yet, so its understandable if the jury is still deliberating. There are certainly those who think Windows 7 is nothing more than Windows Vista with an extra bell or whistle thrown in for eye candy.\n\nTo be honest, I like Windows 7 and believe it will be a phenomenal success for Microsoft. Earlier I wrote a post detailing 5 reasons to upgrade to Windows 7. But, just to play devil\u2019s advocate, let\u2019s take a look at 5 ways Windows 7 could become another Vista.\n\n1. UAC still there. UAC-- the bane of Windows Vista-- hasn\u2019t gone away. Microsoft altered the behavior and added a configuration slider than enables the user to select what level of protection UAC will provide, thus controlling the volume of pop-up alerts generated by UAC. However, after much debate with the security community during the Beta testing, the default setting is still set to what users experienced with Windows Vista. Frankly, UAC serves a purpose and it is better to leave it alone. But, those who dislike UAC are going to have to go into the control panel and modify the configuration to their liking or be faced with the same pop-ups that annoyed the world with Vista.\n\n2. Hardware and Drivers. Windows Vista stumbled and fell right out of the blocks as a result of lagging hardware and device driver support. The vendors just weren\u2019t ready when Vista was launched and Vista never really recovered from the damaged reputation even after most of those issues were resolved. The legal issues Microsoft faced with the Windows Vista compatible logo debacle didn\u2019t help either. Users get upset when they get a new operating system and find out that their existing printer, wireless router, webcam, or other peripheral hardware doesn\u2019t work with it. They are left with the choice of not having the hardware or springing for new hardware that is compatible which doesn\u2019t make them happy campers.\n\n3. Performance improvement minor. A lot of fuss has been made about performance tweaks that ostensibly make Windows 7 faster than Windows Vista or Windows XP. In my opinion, vendors in general and Microsoft specifically should make these improvements, but not market them. The problem is that \u2018performance\u2019 is so subjective to the exact hardware the operating system is running on, or the types of applications being run, or the number of applications being run simultaneously. Citing performance as a selling point almost always backfires because A) the performance improvement is generally not enough to make a difference to normal users, and B) there are almost always just as many studies and reviews showing equal or even slower performance which turns into a sort of he-said / she-said marketing nightmare.\n\n4. Expensive. Face it. Windows 7 is not cheap. For those who are purchasing a new computer system with Windows 7 pre-installed, Windows 7 is great. For those running Windows XP or Windows Vista and just wanting to upgrade the OS on their existing hardware, spending $100 to $300 depending on the flavor of Windows 7 can be a tough pill to swallow. You can get a brand new desktop computer with Windows 7 for around $300, and the latest version of the Mac OS was only $29.\n\n5. No direct upgrade from XP. To me, this is the most obvious mis-step by Microsoft in developing Windows 7. Maybe it just couldn\u2019t be done, but I would have had all of my best developers working night and day to figure out how to make it happen. After the issues with Windows Vista, and knowing that the vast majority of users-both consumer and enterprise-are still relying on Windows XP, it seems like a direct upgrade path is a necessity. Many users may be frustrated by the lack of upgrade path and having to do a fresh install, reinstall all of the other software and migrate user settings. Microsoft has provided tools to ease the pain, but this is still the biggest opportunity for negative PR or backlash related to Windows 7.\n\nMy take: Windows 7 will be a success and restore some lost faith in Microsoft. I also think that Windows XP users should upgrade to something...anything. The Windows XP operating system is a decade old. If you don\u2019t like Windows 7, by all means switch to Mac OS X or load Ubuntu Linux or something, but enough already with the Windows XP.\n\nTony Bradley is an information security and unified communications expert with more than a decade of enterprise IT experience.

        "body": "There have been times when Microsoft launching a new operating system was a big deal. Yesterday was not one of them. And that\u2019s how Microsoft wanted it.\n\nI know people will disagree, citing the apparent effort Microsoft put into those dopey launch parties and other consumer promotions, but the difficulty of upgrading from XP to Windows 7 makes it a difficult sell.\n\nThere was no real excitement, no real surprises at the Windows 7 launch yesterday in New York. And that\u2019s OK.\n\nFor consumers and many small businesses, Windows 7 is the operating system that will come on their next PC. Will the new OS convince customers to upgrade to new hardware for the holidays? Will it uncork pent-up demand?\n\nThat probably depends more on the economy than anything else, which is a win for Microsoft after many customers went out of their way to avoid Vista. If you need a new computer, Windows 7 seems a safe choice.\n\nHow do we know? Because Windows 7 is so well known, and user-tested, that there was little for Microsoft to say at the launch. The new OS was even widely available ahead of yesterday\u2019s event.\n\nFor business, Microsoft is pushing upgrades. And it appears it will get them. IT departments are not as shy about reformatting disks and reloading applications as consumers.\n\nStill, I have talked to a number of small businesses that see no reason to upgrade--no compelling features--and will wait. Presumably until their XP hardware finally dies. Or until Windows 7 SP1 is released, whichever comes first.\n\nFrom a consumer perspective, Windows 7 is an improved \u201cVista Lite\u201d OS. For enterprises, it improves on both XP and Vista and adds new features. It shows that Microsoft learned from it Vista mistakes and dialed back the glitz in favor of building a more useful OS than either XP or Vista.\n\nThe #1 Goal of Windows 7 is to not be another Windows Vista and, so far, it has succeeded. Microsoft wisely sacrificed surprise and hoopla for confidence and trust, which Windows 7 is well on its way to building.\n\nDavid Coursey tweets as @techinciter and can be contacted via his Web site."

        "body": "Microsoft Corp. wants to get its suite of hosted messaging and collaboration products certified to the ISO 27001 international information security standard, part of an effort to try and assure customers about the security of its cloud computing services. It comes amid broad and continuing doubts about the ability of cloud vendors in general to properly secure their services.\n\nGoogle, which has made no secret of its ambitions in the cloud computing arena, is currently working on getting its services certified to the government\u2019s Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) standards for much the same reason.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much value customers of either company will attach to the certifications, particularly because they were not designed specifically to audit cloud computing environments. Even so, the external validation offered by the standards is likely to put both companies in a better position to sell to the U.S. government market.\n\nSpeaking with Computerworld this week, Bill Billings, chief security officer of Microsoft Federal, said the company is currently in the process of taking its Business Productivity Online Suite through the ISO 27011 certification process. The hosted service includes Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Office Live Meeting and Office Communications Online. He declined to say just when Microsoft hopes to achieve the certification.\n\nThe goal is to offer customers, particularly in the government, a higher level of assurance about Microsoft\u2019s cloud services than FISMA-certification alone provides, said Teresa Carlson, vice president of Microsoft Federal.\n\n\u201cFISMA is outdated. It is largely a paper-based exercise. We want to take it up a notch\u201d by getting ISO 27011 certification, Carlson said. At the same time, Microsoft is also working to get its cloud services certified to the standards prescribed under FISMA; it hopes to complete the task by year\u2019s end, Carlson said.\n\nThe ISO 27001 standard is managed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission. To get certified under the standard, Microsoft will need to show that its physical, logical, process and management controls for protecting its suite of cloud services meet a rigorous set of audit criteria.\n\nThough the ISO 27011 standard is widely recognized internationally, it has failed to gain much traction in the U.S., said Chenxi Wang, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cMost U.S. companies don\u2019t pay much attention to ISO 27001. They don\u2019t know quite what to make of it.\u201d\n\nEven so, in the absence of any cloud-specific certification standard, ISO 27001 remains one of the best security benchmarks available. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing specific to cloud-computing in it. But it has been used in traditional outsourcing for years and is the best standard there is\u201d for information security, she said.\n\nSalesforce.com last year became one of the first vendors of hosted applications to become certified under ISO 27001 standards. It\u2019s unclear how much that certification has helped the company acquire new customers, Wang said. But it has certainly played a role in reinforcing Salesforce.com\u2019s message about the security and reliability of its products.\n\nNews about Microsoft\u2019s plans to acquire ISO 2700 certification comes amid persisting concerns about cloud security. The concerns have been fueled by high-profile incidents such as the recent chaotic outage of Microsoft\u2019s Sidekick T-Mobile and one in July involving Twitter and Google Apps.\n\nThough the vendors themselves and many analysts have insisted the incidents had nothing to do with cloud security failures, the perception about the cloud being vulnerable to security failures has continued to persist. It is for those reasons that certifications such as ISO 27001and FISMA are important, especially in government, Billing said.\n\n\u201cWithin the federal market, it is a cultural issue,\u201d Billings said. \u201cThis is really about making them feel comfortable about their partnership\u201d with Microsoft."

        "body": "Strong sales of netbook computers, combined with plummeting sales of Microsoft Office to consumers, hurt Microsoft Corp.\u2019s otherwise-strong first-quarter 2010 results reported today.\n\nAt least one analyst expects the trend to continue, even with the release of a netbook-friendly Windows 7 and a free Web version of Office for consumers.\n\nNetbooks made up about 12% of total Windows shipments in the first quarter, Microsoft general manager for investor relations, Bill Koefoed, said in a conference call after the earnings release. And netbook shipments are likely to keep growing faster than the rest of the market, acknowledged Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell.\n\nDue to Vista\u2019s bloated operating system, which takes more hard drive space and processing power, those netbooks almost all run Windows XP. Microsoft reportedly earns about $15 for every copy of Windows XP sold to a PC maker, or original equipment manufacturer (OEM), compared with $50 to $60 for every copy of Vista, and now, Windows 7, sold to PC makers.\n\nAs a result, OEM revenue was down 6% year-over-year, despite Microsoft\u2019s selling an unspecified \u201crecord number of Windows licenses\u201d this quarter due to the release of Windows 7 to OEMs in July. Total Windows revenue of $4.09 billion was down 4% from a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft is trying to entice netbook makers to switch to the relatively streamlined Windows 7, especially the low-end Windows 7 Starter.\n\nMicrosoft did not say how many netbooks this quarter shipped with Windows 7 instead of XP.\n\nAccording to Rob Helm, an analyst with the independent Directions on Microsoft, Windows 7 Starter costs OEMs about twice as much as XP. For most netbooks, that will be too high, he said. As a result, he doesn\u2019t expect most OEMs to switch off XP until it is phased out next fall.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Business Division revenue fell 11% year-on-year to $4.4 billion, dragged down by a 34% year-over-year decline in consumer sales. That mirrors a 30% annual drop in the prior quarter. Sales to consumers make up about a quarter of MBD\u2019s total revenue. They come mostly from retail sales of Microsoft Office.\n\nMicrosoft has juiced Office sales in the last several years through heavy promotions for students, military personnel, retirees and other groups.\n\nThat has come back to bite Microsoft, Helm said, by \u201churting their [year-over-year revenue] comparables.\u201d Strong sales of netbooks, which are often too lightweight to run the full Office suite, has hurt, too, he said.\n\nConsumer revenue may continue to fall, as Microsoft gets ready to debut the free Office Web for both consumers and enterprises.\n\nAimed to counter the free Google Docs, Office Web won\u2019t have all of the features of Office 2010. Microsoft plans to run ads inside Office Web to entice users to upgrade to Office 2010, Helm said. While that may entice large businesses, he doesn\u2019t see that tactic attracting many consumers.\n\n\u201cA lot of the new capabilities in Office 2010 depend on businesses running SharePoint Server,\u201d he said. \u201cFor consumers and small businesses, Office 2010 becomes a lot harder sell because it looks an awful lot like Office 2007.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t talk about how it plans to win back consumers to Office during its conference call. Liddell said he doesn\u2019t expect MBD\u2019s overall sales to pick up in the second quarter, although they may pick up in calendar year 2010 as businesses begin to upgrade to Office 2010."

        "body": "Almost everyone likes Windows 7. It\u2019s faster, cleaner and easier to use. But is paranormal activity wrecking the rollout?\n\nWhen Microsoft launched Windows 95 some 14 years ago, the entire launch event seemed charmed. It was sunny in Seattle. Locals wondered what that yellow thing was in the sky. And Microsoft\u2019s guests, who came in from all corners of the world, joked that Bill Gates must have paid a fortune for such weather.\n\nIt was the only Microsoft event I have ever attended where there was genuine excitement in the room. The Windows 95 commercials were optimistic and made you want to use a PC. No question: The Windows 95 launch was magic. Windows 7? Not so much.\n\nJust in time for Halloween, the Windows 7 launch is being undermined by some unexplained phenomena. Consider the following.\n\nThe Today Show, which averages some 5 million viewers, hosted Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to officially launch the Windows 7 operating system. But what possessed the Today Show art department to show Windows 7 on an older MacBook Pro behind Ballmer?\n\nMicrosoft can hardly blame the Today people. The company did the same thing in one of its own ads. The laptop used in a TV commercial for Microsoft\u2019s Songsmith is a MacBook. Microsoft put stickers all over the Mac, including one strategically placed over the Apple logo, to hide the fact. Are Windows laptops really that hard to find?\n\nWhat kind of poltergeist at CNBC caused the network to mess up the Microsoft guidance numbers? The day after Windows 7\u2019s launch, Microsoft announced earnings that, though they represented lower revenue and profits, beat Wall Street estimates and earned the company a rapidly rising stock price. But at approximately 10:50 that morning, CNBC and a Wall Street Journal blog called Digits falsely reported that Microsoft had lowered its previous estimates about future earnings, which triggered a steep decline in the value of Microsoft shares.\n\nWho\u2019s the genius who came up with the idea of a promotional Burger King Windows 7 Whopper? It\u2019s a regular Whopper hamburger, but with seven hamburger patties. Burger King restaurants in Japan this week started selling the Microsoft tie-in sandwich through a print ad.\n\nUnfortunately, journalists, bloggers and even CNN rushed to Tokyo to try the burger. The ensuing pictures and videos show that the Windows 7 Whopper has all the characteristics Microsoft says Windows 7 itself doesn\u2019t have. The burger is big, bloated, ugly, hard to \u201cuse\u201d and slow (to eat). The promotion just gave people another reason to laugh at Microsoft\u2019s marketing ineptitude.\n\nThe Family Guy cartoon is usually hilarious. But a Windows 7 tie-in did nothing but damage the reputations of both Microsoft and Family Guy. The Windows 7 segment -- which isn\u2019t a commercial, but actually part of the show -- was meant to go viral, and it did. Unfortunately, all the online chatter about the video was about how bad it was, and how shameful it was for the Family Guy producers to sell out like that.\n\nAs part of its broad set of Windows 7 launch initiatives, Microsoft contracted with a company called House Party to organize Windows 7 launch parties around the country. Selected party hosts got copies of Windows 7 signed by Steve Ballmer (uh, that increases its value by approximately nothing), plus \u201cparty favors\u201d you would expect to see at the birthday of a 6-year-old.\n\nThe video was created by House Party, not Microsoft. But how could Microsoft allow it to happen? You\u2019ve seen the video. The only possible explanation is that the actors are possessed by evil spirits.\n\nAnd you\u2019ve probably seen most of the inevitable parody videos. But have you seen the new Funny or Die parody? Ouch!\n\nDuring the official U.K. launch event in London, the demonstration PCs on the stage lost Internet connectivity during a demo of the Virtual Earth application. Giant screens all over the presentation hall showed huge error messages saying that an Internet connection could not be found.\n\nLack of Internet access ruined the subsequent demo of the Sky Player. After resuming with a Q&A session and believing the problem solved, Microsoft executives tried again to demonstrate Sky Player, and again the Internet connection had mysteriously vanished.\n\nThere\u2019s no question about it. Something eerie is happening around Microsoft\u2019s Windows 7 marketing. But don\u2019t let that spook you. Windows 7 is the best version of Windows that has ever existed.\n\nJust stay away from that burger, and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nMike Elgan writes about technology and global tech culture.

But Thurrott said that a few simple steps lets users install upgrade editions, which are considerably cheaper than the full versions designed for fresh installations.\n\nWindows 7 Home Premium, for example, costs $119.99 as an upgrade, but $199.99 for the full edition, a difference of $80. The full versions of Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate, however, cost $100 more than the corresponding upgrades.\n\nNearly three years ago, Thurrott showed users a similar trick with the then just-released Vista; that technique, however, required users to install Vista twice.\n\nToday, Thurrott spelled out how to conduct a clean install using a Windows 7 upgrade license. The process requires users to install but not activate Windows 7 with the accompanying product key. After the installation is completed, users must make a minor change to the Windows registry, use the Windows \u201crearm\u201d command, then reboot.\n\n\u201cWhen Windows 7 reboots, run the Activate Windows utility, type in your product key and activate Windows,\u201d Thurrott said. \u201cVoila!\u201d\n\nThe rearm command can also be used to run a copy of Windows 7 for up to 120 days without activation, a trick that Microsoft confirmed two months ago.\n\nMicrosoft allows users to install and run any version of Windows 7 for up to 30 days without requiring a product activation key, the 25-character alphanumeric string that proves the copy is legitimate. The rearm command can be used as many as three times at the end of each 30-day grace period to extend the activation-free ride for approximately four months.\n\nSome users commenting on Thurrott\u2019s blog reported that they were able to do a clean install using a Windows 7 upgrade key without resorting to his registry hack and the rearm command. Thurrott, however, was skeptical.\n\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to try this, but my guess is that there was a version of Windows on the hard drive that Setup detected, thus making the install and activation work properly,\u201d he said."

At least one of them, which required users to fire up a command-line tool called \u201cOscdimg\u201d to create an .iso out of the downloaded files, did the trick, people reported. Oscdimg must be downloaded from the Microsoft Web site; it\u2019s available as part of the \u201cWindows Automated Installation Kit\u201d for Windows XP and Vista.\n\nThe Download Squad Web site has also published a set of instructions on converting the downloaded files to a disk image.\n\nBut users continued to post complaints. \u201cAny updates at all on this?

        "body": "Are you just waking up and nursing a hangover after hosting one of those wild Windows 7 launch parties? No? Well, you at least attended one, right? Invited to one but had a scheduling conflict??\n\nLet\u2019s face it, the Windows 7 launch party concept was a complete and utter failure. The YouTube video Microsoft created to market the launch party concept certainly got attention, but for all the wrong reasons. It was almost universally mocked and parodied. Just look at the endless list of \u2018Related Videos\u2019 making fun of the launch party promotion.\n\nOne reader commented in the PC World forums to lament his attempts at hosting a launch party. After receiving only one response, which wasn\u2019t even the official RSVP, the reader examined the RSVP in more detail and found \u201dit looked like the whole TON of apparently life-sucking legalese I had to agree to in order to HOST a party. With even GUESTS having to agree to everything short of giving up their BIRTHRIGHTS to Microsoft and its subsidiaries, heirs, etc., how is ANYBODY supposed to actually get people to do the \u201cofficial RSVP?!?\u201d\n\nEven PC World\u2019s Rick Broida got so little response to his own Windows 7 launch party invites that he simply canceled the event.\n\nMy PC World colleague David Coursey believes that Microsoft intentionally played the Windows 7 launch low-key. After the wild spectacle that accompanied the launch of Windows Vista, and the subsequent backlash against that OS, it makes sense that Microsoft would take a more practical approach this time to avoid any proverbial egg on the face.\n\nI agree with Coursey that the official Windows 7 launch events had less hoopla by design. However, the Windows 7 launch party concept and Microsoft\u2019s attempts at igniting hoopla at a grassroots level demonstrate an attempt to hedge its bets and have its cake and eat it too. Unfortunately, nobody was having any cake at Windows 7 launch parties.\n\nRemember high school--cool kids went to parties and had fun while nerds hung out at math club and played Dungeons and Dragons? Well, the two don\u2019t mix. Hosting a party where you play Dungeons and Dragons or discuss algebraic functions doesn\u2019t make you cool just because you put the word \u2018party\u2019 on it.\n\nMicrosoft has had many failed attempts at being hip and cool. Microsoft Bob. The Office paperclip character. The Bill Gates / Jerry Seinfeld ads that seemed to require some sort of psychotropic mind enhancement in order for them to make sense. It just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nApple is cool. I don\u2019t agree with the premise of many of the Apple \u201cI\u2018m a Mac\u201d ads, but I almost always find them entertaining and compelling. Apple didn\u2019t waste any time coming out with a new series of the \u201cI\u2018m a Mac\u201d ads targeting Windows 7 too.\n\nMicrosoft does much better when it accepts its nerd-factor or at least sticks to more practical advertising. The \u201cI\u2018m a PC\u201d campaign, mocking the \u201cI\u2018m a Mac\u201d ads and embracing the fact that Windows is not Mac OS X, or the more poignant Laptop Hunters ad campaign, are both examples of Microsoft making a point without trying to be cool.\n\nLet Apple be hip and cool. Apple has gained some operating system mojo lately, but it is nowhere near posing a threat to Windows dominance. Windows 7 already had word-of-mouth momentum from the unprecedented Beta and RC (release candidate) preview access and the Windows 7 launch party was a bad idea that just gives Microsoft opponents one more thing to ridicule.\n\nWindows 7 is cool, as far as operating systems go, but not worthy of drinks and appetizers while everyone loads it up and shares tips and tricks with each other--not even for uber nerds. The only launch party I know of that was even a remote success was this one hosted by PC World senior editor Robert Strohmeyer.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even save me a piece of cake.\n\nTony Bradley is an information security and unified communications expert with more than a decade of enterprise IT experience.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s results smashed Wall Street expectations on Friday, sending its shares up 7 percent, as the PC market improved and sales of its Windows software and Halo video game were stronger than expected.\n\nThe results top a big week for the world\u2019s largest software company, which launched its Windows 7 operating system to positive reviews on Thursday, as it looks to regain leadership in the technology sector from rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is back. They are able to succeed despite heightened competition from Apple\u2019s share gain and Google\u2019s great brand,\u201d said Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. \u201cThe numbers were unbelievable. An absolutely blowout.\u201d\n\nWith their biggest one-day jump since April, Microsoft\u2019s shares hit their highest level since June 2008, helping the Nasdaq pare losses. The results follow better-than-expected earnings from technology bellwethers IBM, Intel Corp, Google and Apple.\n\nFiscal first-quarter profit fell 18 percent to $3.57 billion, or 40 cents per share, compared with $4.37 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nWall Street had expected much worse, calling for profit of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nSales fell 14 percent to $12.92 billion, partly reduced by a deferral of $1.47 billion in revenue to future quarters related to Microsoft\u2019s free upgrade to Windows 7 for recent buyers of the predecessor Vista system.\n\nThat beat analysts\u2019 average forecast of $12.31 billion, the first time the software maker had done so in a year.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s results are closely tied to sales of PCs, which rose in the latest quarter by about 2 percent after two quarters of declines.\n\nThe company did not include any pre-sales of Windows 7 in its latest results, offering the hope that the current quarter will show a boost in sales from the new system.\n\n\u201dYou are seeing some of the benefit of the improvement in PCs that we have heard about,\u201c said Brendan Barnicle at Pacific Crest Securities. \u201dThis is a trend. They\u2019ve got some good momentum behind them and it\u2019s just going to get accelerated now that you have Windows 7 out in the market.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company played down hopes for a quick recovery from the worst recession in decades, sticking with a characteristically cautious outlook.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 (which ended June 30) may well have been the bottom of the economic reset,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Christopher Liddell on a conference call on Friday.\n\nHe repeated his view that technology spending should recover gradually in 2010. \u201cWe are not seeing a large rebound, but we\u2019d like to think, certainly as we go into next calendar year, we\u2019ll start to see businesses spending again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company, which is tightening its belt in the economic slowdown, also cut its outlook for operating expenses for the full fiscal year to $26.2 billion from its previous target of $26.5 billion.\n\nQuarterly profit fell in Microsoft\u2019s main units, producing the Windows operating system and Office suite of applications. Profit rose in its server unit and its entertainment and devices unit, which makes the Xbox console and Halo video game series. Its loss-making online services unit, which includes the new Bing search engine, reported a wider loss than a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 7.6 percent, or $1.99, at $28.58 on Nasdaq. They have risen 92 percent since hitting a more-than 10 year low in March."

        "body": "Microsoft reported revenue that was down 14 percent year-on-year for its first fiscal quarter, with net income down 17 percent -- but it still beat analyst expectations on both counts.\n\nThe figures were dragged down by deferral of revenue from sales of Windows 7 to PC manufacturers ahead of the operating system\u2019s launch on Thursday, the company said.\n\nOverall revenue totalled US$12.92 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $15.06 billion a year earlier. Net income fell to $3.57 billion, for earnings per share of $0.40, down from $4.37 billion a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast revenue of $12.32 billion and EPS of $0.32.\n\nThe $1.47 billion in deferred revenue would not have been enough to maintain sales in the company\u2019s Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue fell $1.66 billion year on year, to $2.62 billion.\n\nHowever, chief financial officer Chris Liddell put a bright face on it.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with our performance this quarter and particularly by the strong consumer demand for Windows,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIf Microsoft had not had to defer Windows 7 sales, profit would have gone up 8 percent, it said.\n\nSales in the Servers and Tools Division remained steady at around $3.4 billion, with operating income there up 23 percent to $1.28 billion while operating profit in the Entertainment and Devices Division, which makes the Xbox, doubled to $312 million on sales that were steady at $1.89 billion.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s results were buoyed by consistent strength in consumer PC sales, including the rise of netbooks, Liddell said during a conference call Friday. \u201cWhat I think we\u2019re seeing is the robustness in the concept of a PC. It\u2019s something people want to spend money even in a recession.\u201d\n\nBut weakness in computer purchasing by businesses has posed \u201ca significant negative,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat can\u2019t continue forever,\u201d he added. \u201cEventually those PCs wear out and need to be replaced.\u201d\n\nRight now, corporate customers are \u201cplaying out\u201d budgets that were set late last year when the crisis was at its worst, so Microsoft does not believe business spending will pick up until 2010, according to Liddell.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all waiting to see how the economy rebounds and how well it does,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a large rebound but certainly as we go into next calendar year we\u2019ll see businesses spending again, and we\u2019ll be raised with that.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft expects \u201cflattish\u201d performance on the services side for the rest of its fiscal year, he added.\n\nAs for Windows 7, Microsoft has received good anecdotal feedback from corporate customers, but expects companies won\u2019t start upgrading until next year, Liddell said.\n\n\u201cCertainly all the early signs are good at this stage,\u201d he said. Pre-orders for the OS have been \u201cextremely good,\u201d and the vendor is anticipating strong retail sales through the holiday season, he added.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up about $1.81 in midday trading Friday to $28.40."

Everything you need to know about Windows 7: As the headline says, everything you need to know about Windows 7 (and then some) can be found at the link. The official launch was anticlimactic, given all that had been reported well before Thursday, but the arrival of Windows 7 still tops the list of news this week.\n\n2. FCC takes first step toward net neutrality rules, FAQ: What\u2019s the FCC vote on net neutrality all about? and Net neutrality could lead to inexpensive, high-quality broadband services for businesses\n\n: And there\u2019s a lot more to sink your teeth into with the coverage of the FCC\u2019s vote to consider whether it should impose regulations on Internet service providers regarding applications and services that the providers allow, impose rate limits on or outright ban users from accessing on broadband networks. Network World\u2019s Tim Greene compiled a helpful FAQ and also wrote an interesting piece about the possible ramifications of net neutrality on broadband services for businesses.\n\n3. Sun to cut 3,000 jobs as Oracle awaits merger approval and EU slams Oracle\u2019s cooperation in Sun investigation: The shoe dropped this week for Sun Microsystems employees, with word that 3,000 of them worldwide will lose their jobs. That was no surprise, really, given that Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said recently that Sun is losing US$100 million as the companies await European approval for Oracle\u2019s planned takeover of Sun. Meanwhile, the European Commission seemingly placed blame for approval delay squarely on Oracle, publicly chastising the company for its lack of cooperation in the Commission\u2019s investigation into possible competition issues.\n\n4. Microsoft and Google sign deals with Twitter and Google, Microsoft search rivalry heats up: The Web 2.0 Summit is one of the busier, and more interesting, industry conferences, and this time around it also produced a breaking-news duel between Microsoft and Google. First, Microsoft announced that it has signed collaboration deals with Twitter and Facebook. A few hours later, Google announced it has a collaboration deal with Twitter.\n\n5. Apple reports $1.67 billion quarterly profit on record Mac, iPhone sales, Wall Street Beat: Amazon, Apple shine in heavy earnings week and Microsoft profits fall less than expected: Recession-proof Apple made a breathtaking amount of money last quarter, considering the state of the global economy. It was otherwise a busy week for earnings reports, with Amazon saying that it did well, too, while Microsoft\u2019s profit slipped less than had been expected.\n\n6. Sergey Brin laments Yahoo\u2019s Microsoft search deal: Google cofounder and President of Technology Sergey Brin made a surprise appearance at Web 2.0, offering his perspective on a variety of topics, including Yahoo\u2019s search deal with Microsoft.\n\n7. Symantec_Rogue_Security_Software_is_Big_Business_for_Crooks\u201d>Symantec: Rogue security software is big business for crooks: \u201cScareware\u201d popups that give alarming warnings to users that their PCs are infected pose an increasing threat, Symantec said. Some of the popups try to lure users to download useless software, but in other cases they lead the unsuspecting to infect their computers with malicious software.\n\n8. Apple overhauls iMac line, with 21.5-, 27-inch models: Apple rolled out a major update of its iMac desktop line -- just in time for the holiday shopping season.\n\n9. Canonical takes on Windows 7 with Ubuntu 9.10 RC: Windows 7 wasn\u2019t the only OS news, with Canonical making available the release candidate of Ubuntu 9.10 on the same day that Microsoft hosted its launch events. The Ubuntu release is dubbed Karmic Koala.\n\n10, Mozilla_unblocks_one_sneaky_Microsoft_add_on\u201d>Mozilla unblocks one sneaky Microsoft add-on: Last weekend, Mozilla blocked two buggy Microsoft add-ons to Firefox and then early this week started unblocking them. The interesting aspect of this news, though, was the back-and-forth that apparently ensued between Mozilla and Microsoft."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street expectations, sending shares of the world\u2019s largest software maker sharply higher on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf you have a wounded animal and you corner it, that is when it is at its most dangerous. Microsoft knows that its core businesses are under siege from competitors as powerful as they are -- IBM Google, Apple and others. They can swing into action when they have to. They have considerable resources to bring to the table.\u201d\n\n\u201dProbably the PC picked up because of what Intel said that the fourth quarter and going forward is slightly up from what was previously forecast. They\u2019re seeing not a recovery, but a little bit of a turnaround.\n\n\u201dThey\u2019re going to be well positioned to take some share away on the server side and as well on the content management side.\n\n\u201cWe think Oracle reported a disappointing quarter recently largely because they\u2019re going to be struggling with their acquisitions a bit in terms of how they\u2019re going to integrate some of their technologies. So we think Microsoft has a pretty good opportunity going forward in the next 12 to 18 months to take some share away on that end.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis was stronger than we anticipated. Gross margin improved, operating margin was a little weaker than anticipated, but the strength seems to have come from server tools. And online was a little bit better. Entertainment was a lot better.\n\n\u201dAs for the stock today, we\u2019ve seen it: It jumped a lot.\n\n\u201cI think Windows 7 will be more popular than has been generally expected. I think it will kick in faster than Vista or XP, but having said that it will be the March quarter before we see it.\u201d\n\n\u201dMicrosoft is back. They are able to succeed despite heightened competition from Apple\u2019s share gain and Google\u2019s great brand.\n\n\u201dEvery division is solid, including Windows, which is where people thought there would be some slowdown ahead of the Windows 7 upgrade cycle.\n\n\u201dThere is a lot of PC buying going on.\n\n\u201dThe most upside was probably in the entertainment area, which is Xbox. There was about $300 million in upside.\n\n\u201cIn cost controls they reported a really good operating margin and they guided down their op-ex for the year.\u201d\n\n\u201dThey moved the market. They came in with expectation set they were going to be a little soft this quarter in front of the Windows 7 release. The fact they came out and exceeded both the top and bottom line has fueled this move higher.\n\n\u201cThis was their first big product release in some time, a lot of people were looking for this quarter to be not quite as strong, you see the huge revenue upside, big EPS beat, they are taking their operating expense guidance lower. All in all they are setting up for a stronger move with this release of Windows 7.\u201d\n\n\u201dYou are seeing some of the benefit of the improvement in PCs that we have heard about, also some of the benefit is improvement in server unit sales, and you have a huge improvement in Xbox.\n\n\u201dThis is a trend. They\u2019ve got some good momentum behind them and it\u2019s just going to get accelerated now that you have Windows 7 out in the market.\n\n\u201cI had lower numbers and I thought we may get some upside, but not this much. These are fantastic numbers.\u201d"
