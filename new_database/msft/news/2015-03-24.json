        "body": "NICOSIA, March 23 (Reuters) - Aggrieved bondholders who lost funds in Cyprus\u2019s 2013 bailout caused damage to the headquarters of Bank of Cyprus on Monday when they tried to storm the building.\n\nAt least one window of the glass-covered building in the capital Nicosia was smashed and another three cracked when several people among around 200 demonstrators hurled stones and other missiles, witnesses said.\n\nOne woman was knocked unconscious during the protest and was taken to hospital. There was a heavy police presence in the area.\n\nHundreds of junior bondholders saw savings turn to nothing in the tumult of Cyprus\u2019s financial bailout in 2013.\n\nCyprus received 10 billion euros in aid from the European Union and the IMF in return for winding down a major-loss making bank, Laiki, and forcing Bank of Cyprus depositors to forfeit almost half their savings above 100,000 euros to recapitalise that bank.
