        "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Adobe Systems Inc are joining to make their respective sales and marketing software products more potent competitors to Salesforce.com Inc and Oracle Corp offerings, the two firms said Monday.\n\nOn the eve of San Jose, California-based Adobe\u2019s annual user conference, the company said that it will work with Microsoft to create a shared data format between Adobe\u2019s marketing software suite, which the company is re-naming its Experience Cloud, and Microsoft\u2019s sales software, called Dynamics, allowing the software systems to work together seamlessly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to enable to customers to go beyond the current (software) silos they have to navigate today,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise division at Microsoft.\n\nFor Adobe, best known among consumers for its Photoshop digital imaging and Acrobat PDF software, the partnership builds on a deal it struck with Microsoft last fall to use its Azure cloud computing services.\n\nAdobe has been pushing into business-to-business marketing software since it purchased Omniture Inc, a firm that helps website owners track their traffic, for $1.8 billion in 2009. Software that companies use to run digital marketing and advertising campaigns represented about $1.2 billion of Adobe\u2019s $4.6 billion in revenue last year.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft has been trying to expand Dynamics, its software system for sales people. Teaming with Adobe helps it compete more strongly against Salesforce and Oracle, which both offer a combination of sales and marketing software.\n\nMelissa Webster, an analyst with IDC, said that sharing data between systems to ensure customers get a smooth experience will be \u201can important battleground\u201d in business-to-business software.\n\nIf customers have spent a lot of money with a business, they expect the business to remember who they are and don\u2019t like it when they have to constantly re-enter their name and information, she said.\n\n\u201cEvery time a company says with its body language \u2018Who are you, again?\u2019 it eats into their brand equity a little bit,\u201d she said."
