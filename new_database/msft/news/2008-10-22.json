        "body": "Oct 22 (Reuters) - A partnership between health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) and software maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will allow patients covered by the insurer to transfer medical records to Microsoft health platform HealthVault, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nStarting next month, people enrolled in Aetna\u2019s plans will be able to move information from their Aetna \u201cpersonal health record\u201d -- an online repository of data that includes claims, diagnoses, test results and prescriptions -- to HealthVault, the paper said.\n\nPatients can pick and choose what they would like to transfer between Aetna\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s sites, the Journal said.\n\nTo begin with, the program will be available to around 6 million people who have Aetna\u2019s personal health record, the paper said, adding that it will be made available to more Aetna customers next year. Aetna has 17 million members.\n\nCalls to Aetna and Microsoft seeking comment were not immediately returned. (Reporting by Shradhha Sharma in Bangalore; Editing by Rupert Winchester)"

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is expected to cut its forecasts for the remainder of the year as customers curtail software spending amid the economic downturn.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s shares have plunged to an eight-year low and its rivals such as SAP AG (SAPG.DE) have warned of tighter demand.\n\n\u201cGiven the current macro-economic situation, I think there is an expectation that it will use this opportunity to bring down guidance a little bit,\u201d said Pat Becker Jr., portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management. Microsoft is the largest holding of the $62 million Becker Value Equity Fund.\n\nLast month, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer confirmed what most investors already suspected: the world\u2019s largest software maker is not immune to the economic downturn gripping the industry.\n\nWall Street is already bracing for Microsoft to fall short of expectations in fiscal 2009 or come in at the low-end of the forecast range that it issued in July.\n\nAccording to Reuters Estimates, analysts on average expect fiscal 2009 earnings of $2.12 per share -- the bottom of Microsoft\u2019s own forecast range of between $2.12 and $2.18 per share. Wall Street sees revenue at $66.7 billion, below the company\u2019s estimated range of $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has long pushed the idea that its products make up a small but essential part of corporate technology spending and that its software and its markets are diverse and not overly exposed to any one area.\n\nHowever, many investors expect the current financial crisis to run longer and cause a deeper economic downturn than any in recent memory.\n\nMcAdams Wright Ragen analyst Sid Parakh, who has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Microsoft, said a spending slowdown could hit personal computer sales, which are closely coupled with revenue at the company\u2019s Windows business.\n\n\u201cConsidering the turbulence in the financial markets as well as increased caution over the global economic outlook, we expect customers to pull back on IT spending,\u201d Parakh wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nIn the September quarter, worldwide PC shipments remained strong, rising 15 percent from a year ago, driven by demand outside of North America for lower-cost laptops.\n\nSemiconductor giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) also provided some comfort to technology investors, posting a 12 percent profit rise for the September quarter and beating expectations. It issued a conservative -- but not awful -- outlook.\n\nResilient PC demand and new product launches from its computer server business bodes well for Microsoft\u2019s earnings from the quarter ended September 30. Analysts expect profit to rise about 3 percent, to 47 cents per share, on an 8 percent rise in revenue to $14.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nWall Street is forecasting earnings per share of 55 cents in the current quarter on revenue of $18 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nThe December quarter is usually known for being a busy period for Microsoft\u2019s entertainment and devices division as consumers snap up Xbox 360 consoles and video game titles during the holiday shopping season.\n\nThe company cut Xbox 360 prices in September, lowering the price of its entry-level console to below $200 -- a key mass-market price level that Microsoft has said historically accounted for more than 75 percent of all machine sales.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we are going to have a really difficult holiday season with the U.S. consumer pulling back a lot. So the Xbox business might be weak going forward,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.\n\nMicrosoft shares have fallen about 10 percent since the company last reported results on July 17. The stock has fared better than the broader market with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down more than 20 percent during that period.\n\nMicrosoft shares touched an eight-year low at $20.65 on October 10, but it has clawed back to above $24 since then."

        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Internet users have expressed fury at Microsoft\u2019s launch of an anti-piracy tool targeting Chinese computer users to ensure they buy genuine software.\n\nThe \u201cWindows Genuine Advantage\u201d program, which turns the user\u2019s screen black if the installed software fails a validation test, is Microsoft\u2019s latest weapon in its war on piracy in China, where the vast majority of 200 million computer users are believed to be using counterfeit software, unwittingly or not.\n\n\u201cWhy is Microsoft automatically connected with my computer? The computer is mine!\u201d one angry blogger wrote on popular Chinese web portal Sina.com. \u201cMicrosoft has no right to control my hardware without my agreement.\u201d\n\nAnother blogger railed over the cost of authorized versions.\n\n\u201cIf the price of genuine software was lower than the fake one, who would buy the fake one?\u201d he wrote.\n\nA visitor to a Beijing internet cafe said Microsoft was violating people\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cIf, when I\u2018m programing, the computer screen goes black, that will probably cause some important information to be lost,\u201d he said. \u201cWho will pay me for my loss then?\u201d\n\nDong Zhengwei, 35, a Beijing lawyer, described Microsoft as the \u201cbiggest hacker in China with its intrusion into users\u2019 computer systems without their agreement or any judicial authority,\u201d the China Daily said.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s measure will cause serious functional damage to users\u2019 computers and, according to China\u2019s criminal law, the company can stand accused of breaching and hacking into computer systems,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cI respect the right of Microsoft to protect its intellectual property, but it is taking on the wrong target with wrong measures. They should target producers and sellers of fake software, not users.\u201d\n\nThe software giant defended the program on its website as part of its \u201ccommitment to help protect its intellectual property and to help you avoid problems before they happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose ... is to help our customers to determine (if) genuine software is installed on their computers,\u201d Microsoft told Reuters."
