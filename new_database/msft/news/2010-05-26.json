        "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said there are concerns that a debt crisis in the euro zone will not be restricted to the region.\n\nBallmer, who is on an Asian visit, also spoke on Wednesday about the management shuffle within the company that will include the retirement of Robbie Bach, the company\u2019s video games and mobile phones unit head.\n\n\u201cRobbie has been thinking about the possibility of retiring and spending more time with his family. He and I thought on whether we should go ahead and announce that now or wait until after Christmas,\u201d Ballmer said.\n\n\u201cIn the consumer business it has to be way before Christmas or way after Christmas ... I\u2018m happy to make the transition and announce it now.\u201d\n\nThe retirement of Bach, the 22-year veteran, credited with launching the Xbox in 2001, comes as the world\u2019s largest software maker and its mobile efforts are being brushed aside by Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone and Google Inc\u2019s Android operating system in a fast-growing, but increasingly crowded smartphone market.\n\n\u201cRobbie has interests that he wants to pursue and I wish him well on that,\u201d Ballmer said.\n\nOn Europe, Ballmer said the problems in the euro zone may not be limited to that region because the world economy is interconnected.\n\n\u201cI think we all do understand that the world economy is very linked and everybody is nervous that any problems that we might see in Greece (and) Europe will not be isolated in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nHis remarks follow comments from the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein earlier this month that Microsoft was expecting a boost this quarter from a rebound in business tech spending, which would likely outweigh the negative impact from turmoil in Europe.\n\n\u201cBefore the Greek issue everyone has been saying they are more and more cautiously optimistic,\u201d Ballmer told journalists on the sidelines of a Microsoft event in Singapore.\n\nGovernments across the globe are assessing the potential fallout from a debt crisis in Europe.\n\nWhen asked about his views on the business and security environment in China after Google\u2019s withdrawal from the market there, Ballmer said Google\u2019s move was due to censorship rather than security issues.\n\nIn March, Google closed its China-based search service and began redirecting Web searchers to an uncensored portal in Hong Kong, drawing harsh comments from Beijing that raised doubts about the company\u2019s future in the world\u2019s largest Internet market.\n\n\u201cThe reason that Google withdrew from China has nothing to do with security. There are hackers around the world, there are hackers in every country. You cannot say \u2018I cannot do business in some countries because there are some hackers who live here,'\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft has said it remains committed to China even after Google\u2019s decision to retreat because of censorship.\n\nBallmer added that countries such as India and Indonesia have become more attractive compared with China to Microsoft because of better intellectual property protection."

        "body": "While governments and other organizations are stepping up efforts at providing more information for public consumption, they should also provide tools to allow people to interpret this data, argued a Microsoft social media researcher.\n\n\u201cInformation is power, but interpretation is more powerful,\u201d said Danah Boyd, speaking at the at the O\u2018Reilly Gov 2.0 Expo, being held this week in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe want this information out there. We want people to make informed decisions. But we also want to give them to tools to interpret what we see,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking before an audience of mostly government executives and supporting contractors, she had stated that it is not enough to provide information to the people -- as government agencies are doing through efforts like Data.gov and Data.Gov.UK -- because tools must also be provided to aid in the interpretation process.\n\n\u201cWe need to think not just how we want to make data available but how to help people process it,\u201d she said. Such skills will not come about simply \u201cbecause people have access to information,\u201d she said.\n\nWithout such tools, information can be misused.\n\nAs an example, Boyd pointed to the U.S. registries of sex offenders. Brought about by a 1996 U.S. federal law, nicknamed Megan\u2019s Law, states are allowed to compile public listings of names and addresses of convicted sex offenders within their jurisdictions. While such repositories have helped parents know if there are any pedophiles in their neighborhoods, they have also brought about a fair amount of misunderstanding, she said.\n\nIn many cases, the sex offenders are not pedophiles, but rather offenders who, at the time of their crimes, were barely legal adults who had intimate relations with partners not quite of legal age. The example Boyd used is of one 17-year-old girl who was convicted of having sex with someone a year younger. For these people, being on a registry has led to unjust public shame, she argued.\n\nThe problem doesn\u2019t lie with the registries themselves, but rather with \u201chow people interpret\u201d them, she said. While providing useful information to parents, such registries also \u201chelp people stay afraid and are also meant to encourage certain kinds of hateful feelings towards other citizens,\u201d she said..\n\nAs another example of data misuse, she pointed to a widely cited statistic from a 2006 study from the Crimes Against Children Research Center, which showed that one in seven minors are solicited online.\n\n\u201cMost people assume that one in seven minors are sexually solicited by adults,\u201d she said. But a closer analysis reveals a different picture. Over 90 percent of the solicitations were actually made by other minors or young adults, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen we use these numbers, as politicians and as members of the public, we have to be really careful with what we are saying,\u201d she said. \u201cWe use this information to generate fear.\u201d\n\nBoyd said this practice of spinning information, or interpreting data that supports only a single view, will be done with increasing sophistication in the years to come. \u201cData will become something we will fight over again and again,\u201d she said. \u201cInformation is power. But spinning information is also a power.\u201d\n\nAs a result, people will have to become experts have in interpreting information, or develop what she calls information literacy, and government is in the unique position to help develop such skills, she said."
