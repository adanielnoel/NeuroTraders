        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and the states accusing it of continuing monopolistic behavior asked a federal judge to temporarily delay the end of government oversight of the software giant, according to court documents filed on Tuesday.\n\nMost of the provisions from a 2002 consent decree between Microsoft and the federal government are set to expire on November 12.\n\nIn a joint motion, Microsoft and the 18 states pushing for the government to extend its oversight asked the court to delay the existing deadline \u201conly for so long as necessary\u201d but no later than January 31, 2008.\n\nThe extra time is needed for all of the states to file their motions with the court, the documents said.\n\nThe states want some parts of the 2002 consent decree to be extended to 2012, arguing that Microsoft has failed to live up to the agreement. Some portions have already been extended to 2009.\n\nThe remedy has been challenged by California and some other states, which argue that Microsoft continues to abuse its dominant position in the market for computer operating systems.\n\nEurope\u2019s second-highest court recently affirmed a 2004 European Commission ruling that Microsoft abused its overwhelming market position to crush competitors. The court also upheld a 497 million-euro ($708 million) fine."
