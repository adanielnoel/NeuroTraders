        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. released on Tuesday a suite of free Web services that connect to its Windows operating system, delivering a major element of its strategy to maintain the dominance of its software while extending its reach on the Internet.\n\nThe package of \u201cWindows Live\u201d services, which was first released in a test version in September, makes available in a single download updated versions of e-mail, instant messaging, photo gallery, blogging and event planning applications.\n\nAs part of the new software suite, users can access their free Web e-mail through a downloaded desktop application -- similar to Office Outlook used by many businesses -- instead of using a Internet browser to check, reply or write e-mails.\n\nSimilarly, Windows PC users with a single click can either save photos to the computer\u2019s hard drive or publish and store the pictures on the Web using Windows Live Photo Gallery.\n\nUp against competitors looking to replace traditional Microsoft software that runs on a computer\u2019s hard drive with software run over the Internet as a service, the company faces a dilemma that strikes at the core of its business.\n\nDoes it dive headfirst into Web services at the expense of its dominant Windows and Office franchises? Or does it ignore the shift to Web services and risk outdating its bread-and-butter businesses?\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s solution is to straddle the line between the two with a strategy called \u201csoftware plus services.\u201d The idea is to develop new Web services that complement, but not replace, its traditional software.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft can\u2019t take a brand new approach with services on the Internet because it has to protect Windows and Office,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.\n\nTo understand the company\u2019s strategy, look no further than the executive pushing its Windows Live agenda.\n\nChris Jones, a Microsoft corporate vice president, is well versed in both the Web and desktop worlds. Jones worked on developing new versions of its Windows operating system after guiding Microsoft\u2019s early Internet Explorer initiatives.\n\nNow he\u2019s responsible for leading a team of Web developers who will try to weave the company\u2019s software that runs for free on the Internet like its free Hotmail e-mail, rebranded as Windows Live, together with license-generating desktop software like Windows.\n\nThose links must also extend to cell phones, so users can access services from mobile devices.\n\n\u201cMost people connect to the Internet using a Windows PC, most people use Internet Explorer, many people use Office. We have lots of Hotmail users and lots of (instant) messenger users,\u201d Jones said in an embargoed interview this week.\n\n\u201cIf we just stitch it together and remove the seams, what an opportunity we have.\u201d\n\nBy fostering loyalty to its Web services, Microsoft can create a valuable audience to sell to advertisers. Microsoft and its Web rivals like Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. are all jockeying to capitalize on the surge of advertising money flowing to the Web.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft sees the market for online advertising doubling in size to $80 billion in two or three years from its current $40 billion.\n\nMicrosoft plans a marketing campaign that will highlight the potential benefits of downloading its new Web services suite to work with its new Windows Vista operating system. The new services are available at www.windowslive.com.\n\nMorningstar\u2019s Tran said the company has been hindered by a fragmented message to consumers about its Web services.\n\nIn the Web business, Microsoft has two umbrella brands in MSN and Windows Live, while individual applications sometimes share branding like Hotmail and Windows Live Mail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to get a cohesive message to consumers,\u201d said Tran."

(MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it will invest $500 million for a new \u201cserver farm\u201d data center in a Chicago suburb in the latest investment to enhance its Internet services business.\n\nThe 550,000-square-foot (51,100 square-metre) data center in Northlake, Illinois, comes on the heels of Tuesday\u2019s announcement that the software maker will invest an additional $500 million to build a server farm in Ireland.\n\nServer farms are massive buildings housing tens of thousands of powerful computers and data storage systems, providing the base infrastructure upon which Microsoft can create a wide range of Web services.\n\nFrom its Xbox Live online video game system to its Windows Live e-mail and instant messaging applications, Microsoft plans to include an element of Web services in every one of its business divisions.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s capital expenditures have surged in recent years as the company invests billions of dollars in new data centers to keep pace with Web rivals Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc. <YHOO.O, who are also rolling out a variety of services to engage Internet users.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft will lease the property from data center service provider Ascent Corp. and real estate firm The Koman Group. Ascent helped identify the location, set up some of the facility\u2019s infrastructure and develop the site.\n\nThe facility\u2019s construction is expected to be completed in April 2008.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it is adding a feature to its Xbox 360 that limits the amount of time children can play video games.\n\nThe move comes as the software giant tries to make the Xbox 360 more attractive to mainstream consumers ahead of the holiday buying season that is the biggest time of year for the video game industry.\n\n\u201cAs the customer base broadens, the demand for these kinds of capabilities does increase,\u201d said Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft\u2019s entertainment and devices division.\n\nThe new timer can be set to limit playing time on a daily or weekly basis, and turns off the console when the time limit is reached. A similar feature is found in Microsoft\u2019s Windows Vista computer operating system.\n\nMicrosoft research showed 90 percent of parents had some restrictions on video gaming, with half of those being limits on playing time, Bach said.\n\n\u201cThe number-one tool they miss is the ability to enforce time restrictions electronically on the console,\u201d Bach said.\n\nThe Xbox 360, which competes with Sony Corp\u2019s (6758.T) PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co Ltd\u2019s 7974.OS Wii, already has a feature that allows parents to restrict the kind of games that are played based upon their content rating.\n\nMicrosoft also unveiled an initiative with groups such as the National Parent Teacher Association and Boys & Girls Club to educate families about video game content and encourage parents and children to work out rules around gaming."
