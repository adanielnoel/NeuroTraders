        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Financial results from Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp this week brought into sharp relief the challenges the onetime PC partners face as they shift more of their emphasis to cloud computing.\n\nMicrosoft has seen strong long-term growth in parts of its cloud business, a combination of services and software catering to corporations moving computing functions to remote data centers run by outside providers.\n\nWhile revenue for its flagship cloud services business Azure more than doubled last quarter, the company said in Thursday\u2019s earning report, the \u201cintelligent cloud\u201d division that includes it saw just 3 percent revenue growth in the period. And operating profits for the division dropped by 14 percent, in part reflecting non-cloud products included under its umbrella, such as traditional server software.\n\nChipmaker Intel has a less clear path to growth for its cloud operations, and investors have remained skeptical.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price is down about 1 percent over the last year, as software maker Microsoft\u2019s stock rose about 30 percent. Microsoft\u2019s market capitalization of around $440 billion is almost three times Intel\u2019s at $151 billion, compared to about double five years ago.\n\n\u201cWintel\u201d computers running Windows on Intel chips dominated the personal-computing era, which is slowly ending as more people turn to mobile phones for computing needs and corporations deemphasize desktops. Both Intel and Microsoft, run by relatively new CEOs Brian Krzanich and Satya Nadella, are betting their businesses on the cloud.\n\nGraphic on Intel and Microsoft market value: here\n\nAt Intel, in a quarter where the company announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs as it shifts away from the PC, data-center business revenue rose 9 percent to $4 billion. That segment includes the chips powering cloud data centers, where the company says it is doing well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this perception that Microsoft is more on the cusp and benefiting from this (cloud) trend,\u201d said Dan Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co who holds both companies in his portfolio. \u201cIntel is still more drowned out,\u201d meaning not as high-profile.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s best-known play in the cloud is Azure, a set of services for computing and storage as well as tools for software developers.\n\nAzure is gaining ground on Amazon\u2019s AWS unit, the industry heavyweight in cloud computing services. Azure commands about 10 percent of the $23 billion market, estimates Synergy Research, compared with AWS\u2019 31 percent.\n\nIntel has done well in its category, dominating the market for processor chips that are the brains of data center computers, but the business faces major pressures.\n\nMuch of the difference in the companies\u2019 fortunes boils down to Microsoft\u2019s fundamental business as a software company versus Intel\u2019s as a hardware company, said Nick Sturiale, a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners.\n\nClients are spending an ever-larger part of their technology budget on software, according to research firm Gartner. And Intel\u2019s customer base for data-center chips is consolidating into a few big companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft itself, from a much wider group.\n\n\u201cThe cloud vendors are brutal price negotiators and have more power over Intel,\u201d said Sturiale. Average prices of data center chips fell 3 percent in the last quarter, although Intel said that reflected the fact that cheaper chips were gaining ground the fastest.\n\nIntel could suffer as big data-center builders like Facebook increasingly design their own data-center hardware. So far, Intel has held its own, but one day its customers could extend their cost-cutting to chips.\n\nIn a call this week with analysts, Krzanich said Intel\u2019s \u201ctop to bottom\u201d understanding of the cloud-based data center and keen eye on competitors would help it stay ahead.\n\n\u201cAlways paranoid about the competition, always driving,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd you know that we live or die by the performance of our product.\u201d\n\nIntel makes other promising products, including chips for Internet-connected devices known as the Internet of Things. If a blockbuster consumer or business product in that market comes along, those chips could take off.\n\nAnd Microsoft may be overemphasizing how far it has come. Much of its \u201cintelligent cloud\u201d business comprises software for traditional on-premises servers and other businesses with little to do with the cloud. A spokeswoman said the segment\u2019s name \u201cis to align to the ambition\u201d of building the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft also is good at playing up its cloud business. In its January earnings call with investors, the term \u201ccloud\u201d came up 59 times. In Intel\u2019s call this week, it came up 11 times."

Improved profit margins were driven by lower expenses in Microsoft\u2019s phone business, which the company scaled back drastically last year, and sales of Surface portable devices.\n\nRevenue in the group rose 1 percent to $9.46 billion in the quarter. Worldwide PC shipments fell 11.5 percent in the same period, according to research firm IDC.\n\nRevenue in Microsoft\u2019s intelligent cloud business, which includes the Azure cloud infrastructure-and-services business as well as products such as noncloud-related server software, rose 3.3 percent to $6.1 billion in the quarter.\n\nMany investors gauge Microsoft\u2019s cloud strength by looking at what it calls its commercial cloud, a separate measure that includes cloud businesses such as Azure and Office 365 software. The commercial cloud is on track for over $10 billion in revenue for the year starting in March, it said, up from the $9.4 billion figure it gave last time.\n\nChief Executive Satya Nadella has focused on developing the company\u2019s cloud business with his \u201cmobile first, cloud first\u201d strategy, since taking over in early 2014."
