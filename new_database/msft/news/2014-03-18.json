        "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s shares scaled levels last seen in the dotcom boom following reports that the company plans to unveil an iPad version of its Office software suite, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nReuters reported late on Monday that new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella would unveil the iPad app at an event on March 27.\n\nThe event will be Nadella\u2019s first major public appearance since his appointment last month.\n\nMicrosoft shares rose as much as 5 percent to $39.90 on Tuesday, adding $15 billion to the company\u2019s market value. At that price, the stock was up about 10 percent since the announcement of Nadella\u2019s appointment on February 4.

(Reuters Insider: reut.rs/1gC77rr)\n\n\u201cWe estimate that if 10 percent of the iPad install base were to subscribe to Office then this could add 15 million subscribers and generate $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue per year,\u201d Bernstein Research analyst Mark Moerdler said in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors have for years urged Microsoft to adapt Office, its most profitable product, for iPhones and iPads and devices using Google Inc\u2019s Android software rather than shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s productivity tools remain the industry standard in offices, but America\u2019s employees are increasingly using smartphone and tablets to supplement their work.\n\nTired of waiting for Office to be optimized for their touchscreen devices, a growing contingent of younger companies are turning to cheaper touch-friendly apps that can perform word processing and other tasks in the cloud.\n\nBarclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said the plan to launch the iPad app would signal that Microsoft is moving towards a more serious cross-platform strategy.\n\nBernstein\u2019s Moerdler said he did not believe that the app would have any significant positive or negative impact on Microsoft\u2019s Windows franchise as most corporate customers use Windows.\n\nMicrosoft already offers Office Online on its Windows smartphones and as a free Web-based version.\n\nGoogle Inc has been making inroads into Microsoft\u2019s Office software business with its free Google Drive application, which includes spreadsheets, presentation and word-processing tools.\n\nLast year, Apple offered free updates for life on its iWork business software, which includes rival applications to Microsoft\u2019s Excel, Word and PowerPoint, for MacBooks, Mac computers and iPad.\n\nApple also said today it would offer an iPad 4 tablet in place of the mid-range iPad 2 at the same price.\n\nTablets based on Apple\u2019s iOS platform held 36 percent share of the market in 2013, trailing those based on Google\u2019s Android software that had 62 percent share, according to research firm Gartner.\n\nMicrosoft shares were trading up 4 percent at $39.60 in midday trading on the Nasdaq."

Technology shares, up 1.3 percent, led the advance, buoyed by a rally in Microsoft Corp .\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 4 percent to $39.58, the biggest daily advance for the software giant since November, and the move took the stock near $40 a share for the first time since July 2000. Late Monday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the company may unveil an iPad version of the company\u2019s Office software suite on March 27.\n\nIn an address to the Russian parliament, Putin said Russia didn\u2019t want Ukraine to be divided further, and that he did not want to seize more of the country after approving plans to make Crimea part of Russia following a disputed referendum.\n\nHowever, not all market participants were convinced the relief over Ukraine would continue.\n\n\u201cThis is the triumph of hope over experience,\u201d said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. \u201cI would say investors should be very cautious. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a market that is trading on longer-term expectations or possibilities.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.19 points or 0.66 percent, to 16,354.41, the S&P 500 gained 13.95 points or 0.75 percent, to 1,872.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 53.093 points or 1.24 percent, to 4,333.042.\n\nWith the day\u2019s advance, the S&P 500 is less than 1 percent away from an all-time high hit earlier this month. Over the past two sessions, the benchmark index has gained about 1.7 percent.\n\nInvestors were looking ahead to the conclusion of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-setting committee, which began as scheduled at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Tuesday. The central bank is not expected to deviate from previously announced policy plans, but since the Fed\u2019s stimulus has kept a floor under equity prices, market participants will be attuned to any hint of a change.\n\nIn the latest economic data, consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in February, as expected, while housing starts fell modestly from the previous month.\n\nIn company news, Hertz Global Holdings Inc said it would spin off its equipment rental business for $2.5 billion and use part of the proceeds to fund a stock buyback program. Shares edged up 0.8 percent to $27.43.\n\nNasdaq OMX Group Inc lost 2.6 percent to $38.71. New York\u2019s attorney general urged U.S. stock exchanges and other venues to limit services that he said provided unfair advantages to high-frequency traders and undermined confidence in the markets.\n\nIn addition, the Wall Street Journal said Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd IPO-ALIB.N is leaning toward listing shares on IntercontinentalExchange Group\u2019s New York Stock Exchange.\n\nGameStop Corp shares fell 3.5 percent to $38.34 as the worst performer on the S&P 500 after Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it would allow shoppers to trade in used video games for anything from groceries to gadgets.
