        "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions.\n\nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer.\n\n\u201cWith this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\u201d he said in a blog.\n\nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn\u2019s suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing.\n\nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.\n\nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signalled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns.\n\n\u201cThese networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today\u2019s decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.\n\nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23.\n\nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programme, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programmes.\n\nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years.\n\nU.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard.\n\n\u201cGiven Microsoft\u2019s history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\u201d Salesforce said in a statement."
