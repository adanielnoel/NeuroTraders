        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bill Gates and other Microsoft Corp officials stepped up lobbying of top U.S. communications regulators on Monday, ahead of an important vote next week to open up unused wireless airwaves.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has scheduled a November 4 vote on a plan to allow unlicensed use of parts of the airwaves called \u201cwhite spaces.\u201d These pockets of the spectrum will become available when U.S. broadcasters are required to move completely to digital television next year.\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Gates planned to speak to Republican Commissioner Robert McDowell later on Monday, according to Microsoft chief strategist Craig Mundie, who was also in Washington for a lobbying trip.\n\n\u201cPeople seem to be generally favorable\u201d of the FCC proposal, Mundie said of his discussions with regulators. Mundie, who spoke to reporters at a briefing, met on Monday morning with Democratic Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein.\n\nThe FCC, made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, will vote on the white spaces proposal drawn up by Republican commission chairman Kevin Martin.\n\nThe issue pits traditional broadcasters such as Walt Disney Inc\u2019s ABC, CBS Corp\u2019s CBS and General Electric\u2019s NBC against high-tech companies like Microsoft and Google Inc, which want the airwaves for new wireless devices.\n\nA spokesman for the broadcasters said the technology threatens \u201cthe viability of clear television reception.\u201d\n\nBroadcasters want the proposal to go out for public comment, and last week accused its supporters of trying to take broadcast television off the air completely.\n\nWireless microphone users are also concerned the move could cause interference during performances.\n\nCountry music icon Dolly Parton wrote to the FCC asking for more time for the industry to review it. \u201cThe importance of clear, consistent wireless microphone technology cannot be overstated,\u201d Parton wrote in a letter released on Monday.\n\nThe FCC has received thousands of public comments on the issue over the past few years and intends to go forward with the vote next Tuesday, a spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had over a year and a half of testing and building on the public record,\u201d Martin spokesman Rob Kenny said, citing the agency\u2019s technical report, which he said proved \u201cwhite spaces can be used commercially, unlicensed and it can be done without causing harmful interference.\u201d\n\nThe FCC report analyzed two rounds of testing on prototype devices, and cleared the technology to move forward.\n\nOn Friday, Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House of Representatives House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a list of questions to Martin. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, demanded that Martin respond by October 31 on whether an FCC engineering report was peer reviewed, and how the agency will deal with interference from broadcast signals if it occurs.\n\nMundie said Dingell\u2019s letter and the latest request by broadcasters is in \u201cno way indicative of a problem going forward.\u201d"

Measures for safeguarding rights also need to be appropriate,\u201d Yan said.\n\nMicrosoft has defended the black-out programme as a measure to protect its intellectual property and help customers determine that they have legal software.\n\nDong Zhengwei, a Beijing lawyer, said Microsoft was abusing its market power by forcing users to verify the genuineness of their software and had filed a complaint to China\u2019s trade watchdog, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Daily said in separate report.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft should be fined $1 billion,\u201d the paper quoted the lawyer as saying.\n\nYan said Microsoft\u2019s price policies needed to \u201cfit the Chinese situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company adopted unified prices in the past without considering the income gap between developed and developing countries, so we need to kindly remind them that Chinese customers\u2019 affordability should be considered,\u201d Yan said.

In recent years, Microsoft investors have seen it spend billions to build out data centers all over the world.\n\nOzzie said the company has gotten better at ensuring the build-out of data centers do not outpace demand for services.\n\n\u201cWe are throttling our investments commensurate with the demand and how it grows,\u201d said Ozzie, who joined Microsoft after it bought Groove, a company he started.\n\nThe advantage Microsoft holds over competitors, according to Ozzie, in building a platform for cloud computing is because it is one of the few companies who have experience building operating systems for PCs and computer servers and running Web services used by hundreds of millions of users."
