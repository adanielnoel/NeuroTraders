        "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is planning its biggest round of job cuts in five years as the software maker looks to integrate Nokia Oyj\u2019s handset unit, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe reductions, expected to be announced as soon as this week, could be in the Nokia unit and the parts of Microsoft that overlap with that business, as well as in marketing and engineering, Bloomberg reported.\n\nSince absorbing the handset business of Nokia this spring, Microsoft has 127,000 employees, far more than rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc. Wall Street is expecting Chief Executive Satya Nadella to make some cuts, which would represent Microsoft\u2019s first major layoffs since 2009.\n\nThe restructuring may end up being the biggest in Microsoft history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, the report said.\n\nSome of the job cuts will be in marketing departments for businesses such as the global Xbox team, and among software testers, while other job cuts may result from changes Nadella is making to the engineering organization, Bloomberg reported.\n\nLast week, Nadella circulated a memo to employees promising to \u201cflatten the organization and develop leaner business processes\u201d but deferred any comment on widely expected job cuts at the software company.\n\nNadella said he would address detailed organizational and financial issues for the company\u2019s new financial year, which started at the beginning of this month, when Microsoft reports quarterly results on July 22.\n\nMicrosoft could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours."
