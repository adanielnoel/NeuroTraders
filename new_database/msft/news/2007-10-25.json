        "body": "NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday after disappointing results from Comcast (CMCSA.O) and engine maker Cummins (CMI.N) fed worries about corporate profits, while fears of more credit losses hit financial shares.\n\nEconomic reports on housing, manufacturing and employment painted a picture of a weakening economy, adding to the sour mood, as did a surge in oil prices to another record above $90 a barrel.\n\nAmerican International Group Inc (AIG.N) led financial stocks lower on market rumors that the insurer may be facing a large securities write-down.\n\nBut AIG\u2019s stock retraced the bulk of its losses after CNBC reported that the rumors were \u201csimply not true,\u201d helping the Dow and the S&P claw back some of their losses late in the session, as did a 2.4 percent rise in Microsoft MSFT.0 ahead of its earnings.\n\nThe rumors came a day after Merrill Lynch MER.N announced $7.9 billion of credit write-downs.\n\n\u201cConcerns over subprime issues are continuing to bang around out there, and you\u2019ve seen earnings which have been coming in mixed, so that is weighing on investor sentiment,\u201d said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at the Swarthmore Group, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThere were rumors AIG may take a big write-down. Given what Merrill said yesterday about the size of the write-down, people are nervous and you are going to have these rumors.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 3.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 13,671.92. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was down 1.48 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,514.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 23.90 points, or 0.86 percent, at 2,750.86.\n\nRight after the closing bell, Microsoft reported earnings that exceeded expectations and provided a strong outlook, driving its stock up another 11 percent in extended trade to $35.55.\n\nIn the regular session, AIG\u2019s stock ended down 3.2 percent at $61.79. Merrill\u2019s stock lost 3.7 percent to $60.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nComcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable TV operator, posted a 54 percent drop in quarterly net profit. Comcast also lost more basic video subscribers than analysts had expected.\n\nShares of Comcast fell 10.8 percent to $21.28 on the Nasdaq.\n\nAnother drag on the Nasdaq was software maker Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), which gave a weak profit outlook, sending its shares down 12 percent to $18.50.\n\nCummins Inc, which makes diesel engines and power generators, reported a third-quarter profit that rose but still missed estimates, sending its shares down in their biggest one-day percentage decline in nine years. Cummins shares lost 16.6 percent to $111.56.\n\nIt was a tough day for mortgage insurers, too. MBIA Inc (MBI.N), the world\u2019s largest bond insurer, dropped 14.9 percent to $46.99 after it posted a third-quarter loss. Shares of Ambac Financial Group ABK.N tumbled 13.8 percent to $43.95.\n\nSales of new U.S. homes were unexpectedly weak last month, although they climbed off an 11-year low, and orders for durable goods fell, according to data on Thursday that underscored the economy\u2019s weakness.\n\nA third report showed the number of Americans filing an initial claim for unemployment aid edged down last week, but stayed at a level suggesting some softening in the job market.\n\nA bright spot was EMC Corp EMC.N, the top maker of corporate data storage equipment, which reported a 74 percent rise in quarterly profit and doubled its stock-buyback program to $2 billion. Its stock shot up 8.5 percent to $24.45.\n\nTrading was fairly active on the NYSE, with about 1.62 billion shares changing hands, short of last year\u2019s estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on the Nasdaq, about 2.79 billion shares traded, exceeding last year\u2019s daily average of 2.02 billion.\n\nDeclining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 17 to 16 on the NYSE and by 17 to 12 on the Nasdaq."

        "body": "SEATTLE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) lifted its full-year forecasts and posted 23 percent quarterly profit growth on Thursday, topping analysts\u2019 estimates on strong sales of \u201cHalo 3\u201d and Vista, and sending its shares up 11 percent.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software maker raised full-year revenue targets across its business divisions and gave a bullish profit forecast for the crucial, current holiday quarter.\n\nInvestors have waited for sales of the new Windows Vista operating system to pick up since its January release. Windows, which sits on more than 90 percent of all personal computers, generates almost 80 cents in profit for every dollar in sales.\n\n\u201cThe growth of Windows Vista has finally occurred,\u201d said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.\n\n\u201cHalo 3,\u201d the latest installment of Microsoft\u2019s flagship shooter franchise video game, also racked up more than $300 million in its first week of sales in September.\n\nMicrosoft beat even Wall Street\u2019s most bullish forecast with a net profit of $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal first quarter, up from $3.48 billion, or 35 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue rose 27 percent to $13.76 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30.\n\nThe highest analyst profit forecast had been 40 cents per share, with revenue on average seen at $12.54 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\n\u201cIt looks like they\u2019re firing on all cylinders,\u201d said Toan Tran, analyst at Morningstar. \u201cWindows, Office ... all grew by 20 percent and they\u2019re the big hitters for Microsoft.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft shares, already up 10 percent in the last month, surged to $35.40 in after-hours trade, up 10.7 percent from the close and their highest since 2001. Its market capitalization grew by more than $30 billion and its top shareholder, co-founder Bill Gates, saw his fortune grow by $3 billion.\n\nMicrosoft raised its full-year revenue outlook for its Windows client sales to a range of 12 percent to 13 percent versus a previous forecast of 9 percent to 10 percent.\n\nMarket research firms Gartner and IDC had said global PC shipments rose about 15 percent in the September quarter.\n\nRevenue at the Windows client division, focused on PCs, rose nearly 25 percent in the quarter. Operating profit at the segment went up 27 percent to $3.37 billion.\n\nConsumers also bought Xbox 360 consoles to play \u201cHalo 3,\u201d vaulting Microsoft\u2019s game machine past rivals in September.\n\nThe entertainment and devices division, after six straight annual losses, delivered 91 percent revenue growth and swung to a $165 million profit from a $142 million loss a year earlier.\n\nMicrosoft raised full-year earnings estimates to a range of $1.78 to $1.81 per share from a previous range of $1.69 to $1.73. It also raised its full-year revenue estimate range by almost $2 billion, to $58.8 billion to $59.7 billion.\n\nWall Street analysts, on average, were forecasting fiscal 2008 earnings of $1.73 per share on revenue of $57.3 billion.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is never going to be aggressive on guidance. Even from a conservative perspective, it looks to be a pretty positive forward view,\u201d said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager at Jensen Portfolio.\n\nThose figures also include a $85 million impact, or 1 cent per diluted share, from costs and expenses related to its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive.\n\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings of 44 cents to 46 cents per diluted share on revenue of $15.6 billion to $16.1 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings per share of 44 cents a share on revenue of $15.5 billion in the fiscal second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nMicrosoft forecast second-quarter operating profit margin would fall to about 38 percent from 43 percent in the September quarter, due in part to sales of Xbox 360 consoles, which it sells at a loss in order to drive sales of high-margin games.\n\nThe current holiday quarter is a crucial one for Microsoft as it aims to spur adoption of new computers running Vista. Its entertainment arm also banks on the December quarter generating twice as much revenue as any other quarter of the year.\n\nThe company\u2019s online services group lost money for a fifth-straight quarter despite a 25 percent rise in revenue from a year earlier, helped by an $80 million revenue boost from aQuantive, which became part of Microsoft in August.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Office business posted a 20 percent increase in revenue to $4.11 billion and profit rose 21 percent.\n\nPrior to its earnings, Microsoft shares traded at 18 times analysts\u2019 estimated fiscal 2008 earnings, compared with a 17 ratio for rival software maker Oracle Corp ORCL.O. Web rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) trades at 32 times 2008 profit estimates, while International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) was at 14."

It has nearly 50 million today.\n\n\u201cYou combine the number of users with the monetization opportunities and you can figure out a fairly modest average revenue per user per year and you can very quickly get to this level of valuation,\u201d Johnson said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.\n\nMicrosoft has stepped up efforts to be a player in the $40 billion market for online advertising, which the company expects to double in size within three years. It paid $6 billion to acquire digital advertising firm aQuantive in August.\n\nUnder the Facebook deal, Microsoft would be the exclusive third-party advertising platform for Facebook extending a previous deal for Microsoft to sell banner advertising next to Facebook member profiles in the U.S. until 2011.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft, now rivals for Internet-based audiences and applications, have butted heads before for Internet properties. Google beat Microsoft with a $1.65 billion acquisition of online video sharing site YouTube last year.\n\nForrester Research analyst Charlene Li said that Microsoft was a better strategic fit for Facebook, since it knew how to work with software developers and build computing environments -- such as its Windows operating system.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is a company that knows how to build platforms, knows how to develop relationships with developers. Microsoft developed the network that is the biggest, most vibrant one out there,\u201d she said. \u201cGoogle didn\u2019t bring as much to the deal.\u201d\n\nFacebook opened its doors to users beyond an original base of college students a year ago. It also opened the doors to outside developers and there are tens of thousands of developers writing Facebook applications, the company said.\n\nMicrosoft was one of many suitors looking to participate in its latest round of financing, said Facebook Vice President Owen Van Natta. The funds will go toward doubling the company\u2019s staff over the next year and other growth initiatives.\n\nGoogle Co-founder Sergey Brin told a meeting with Wall Street analysts at the company\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters that his company could partner with important Web sites.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel, at a higher level, that we need to own every successful company on the Internet,\u201d said Brin, who later told reporters that Microsoft may have overbid.\n\nGoogle has a multiyear deal with MySpace, the largest social network, to provide search and advertising alongside MySpace\u2019s 110 million user profiles.\n\nEric Schmidt, Google\u2019s CEO, told reporters that its pact with MySpace is performing better than originally expected.\n\nShares of Microsoft rose slightly to $31.60 from a Nasdaq close of $31.25, while Google ticked down to $675.30 from a close of $675.82."

Operating profit at the segment went up 27 percent to $3.37 billion.\n\nConsumers also bought Xbox 360 consoles to play \u201cHalo 3\u201d, vaulting Microsoft\u2019s game machine past rivals in September.\n\nThe entertainment and devices division, which has posted six straight annual losses, delivered a 91 percent rise in revenue and the segment swung to profit of $165 million from a loss of $142 million a year earlier.\n\nMicrosoft raised full-year earnings estimates to a range of $1.78 to $1.81 per share from a previous range of $1.69 to $1.73. It also raised its full-year revenue estimate range by almost $2 billion, to $58.8 billion to $59.7 billion.\n\nWall Street analysts, on average, were forecasting fiscal 2008 earnings of $1.73 per share on revenue of $57.3 billion.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is never going to be aggressive on guidance. Even from a conservative perspective, it looks to be a pretty positive forward view,\u201d said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager at Jensen Portfolio.\n\nThose figures also include a $85 million impact, or 1 cent per diluted share, from costs and expenses related to its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive.\n\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings in a range of 44 cents to 46 cents per diluted share on revenue of $15.6 billion to $16.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts, on average, were forecasting earnings per share of 44 cents a share on revenue of $15.5 billion in Microsoft\u2019s fiscal second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nThe holiday quarter is a crucial one for Microsoft as it aims to spur adoption of new computers running its latest Windows Vista operating system. Its entertainment arm also counts on the December quarter generating twice as much revenue as any other quarter of the year.\n\nThe company\u2019s online services group lost money for a fifth-straight quarter despite a 25 percent rise in revenue from a year earlier helped by an $80 million revenue boost from aQuantive, which became part of Microsoft in August.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Office business posted a 20 percent increase in revenue to $4.11 billion and profit rose 21 percent."

        "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT.O) compliance with a landmark European Union antitrust decision has opened competition for servers, where one rival says it now has a fighting chance to take on the software giant\u2019s dominance.\n\nThe open-source, non-profit Samba software group says it won some things but not everything it wanted this week, when Microsoft said it would stop fighting the EU\u2019s 2004 antitrust decision.\n\nIn a major change of direction, Microsoft agreed to provide rivals with vital interconnection information, one month after the EU\u2019s second-highest court backed the Commission\u2019s decision.\n\nBut the deal leaves the playing field uneven, Samba says.\n\n\u201cThere is still contested ground to win,\u201d said Eban Moglen, a Columbia University law professor who also heads the Software Freedom Law Center, which backs the free software movement and represents Samba.\n\nThat ground is in most offices around the world in computers called servers which run printers, allow desktop PCs to access shared files and act as the cockpit of the entire network, coordinating resources and providing personalized access, user by user.\n\nSamba servers can handle printing and files access but they lack the ability to work as a cockpit, something that can be done today only by Microsoft\u2019s software called Active Directory.\n\nSamba says its own approach is a decade old, which means ancient history in the world of software. Its aim is to provide a free, full-service server software to go head-to-head with Microsoft in the multi-billion dollar market.\n\nTo do that, it needs interconnection information.\n\nThen Samba\u2019s engineers can develop its products, which dovetail with the commercial world. Companies like Red Hat (RHT.N), Canonical and Oracle ORCL.O and others make money by selling service and installation with Samba\u2019s free products.\n\nSevers were originally pioneered for PCs by Novell NOVL.O, which got its interconnect information from Microsoft. Once Microsoft entered the server field it stopped giving full information and rival products stopped working smoothly.\n\nMicrosoft captured the lion\u2019s share of the market, wiping out profits of commercial rivals, the Commission and then the EU court found.\n\nSamba is a non-profit organization so a lack of profits could not kill it, making it the last real competitor standing.\n\nThis week\u2019s deal allows everyone to get full interconnection information from Microsoft for 10,000 euros ($14,220).\n\nThose who resell products making use of the information can choose to pay a royalty of 0.4 percent of turnover to forestall lawsuits on patents claimed by Microsoft.\n\nBut Samba\u2019s General Public License and free software principles require it to be free, without royalty-bearing patents, said Carlo Piana, a lawyer for Samba in Milan, Italy.\n\nThe first step in that direction is to get a definitive list of Microsoft\u2019s patent claims, which has not happened yet.\n\n\u201cUntil we have it we cannot say anything because we just don\u2019t know\u201d, said Volker Lendecke, a software developer for Samba in Goettingen, Germany.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman said on Thursday the list would be posted on the company Website within days. He said 21 of the 106 protocols are covered by patents and other applications are pending.\n\nEven then the path may be uncertain.\n\n\u201cCan we invalidate or render harmless the patents which we which we cannot license?\u201d Moglen said. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question.\u201d\n\nPiana says getting around the patents is necessary.\n\n\u201cLitigating patents would be troublesome,\u201d he said."
