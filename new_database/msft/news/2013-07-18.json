        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings as slow personal computer sales ate into its Windows business and the company took an unexpected $900 million charge for its inventory of unsold Surface tablets.\n\nThe stock fell 5 percent after hours from 5-year highs.\n\nThe massive charge underlines the struggles of the world\u2019s largest software company, which last week announced a deep reorganization to transform itself into a \u201cdevices and services\u201d leader, but is struggling to make mobile computing as attractive as Apple Inc or Google Inc.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest miss we\u2019ve ever seen from Microsoft, the biggest that I could remember,\u201d said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. \u201cIt looks like everything was weak.\u201d\n\nBefore the sell-off late Thursday, Microsoft shares had risen 32 percent this year, beating a 19 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.\n\nMicrosoft said the $900 million charge was related to its Surface RT tablet, the version of its tablet running on ARM Holdings-designed chips. The Surface was meant to challenge Apple\u2019s iPad when it was launched alongside Windows 8 in October, but has not sold well.\n\nEarlier this week, Microsoft said it was drastically cutting prices and expanding distribution of the model to entice buyers, reducing the value of Surface devices in its inventory.\n\n\u201cWe do know we have to do better, particular in mobile devices,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s new chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a big reason we made the strategic organizational changes last week.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s biggest shake-up in five years, unveiled by Chief Executive Steve Ballmer last week, creates a single devices unit for the first time at the company, suggesting that it will double down on its so-far unsuccessful move into hardware.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit of 59 cents per share, compared with a 6 cents per share loss in the year-ago quarter when it wrote off the cost of a failed acquisition.\n\nWall Street had estimated earnings of 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding the Surface charge, Microsoft reported 66 cents per share profit, a less drastic miss.\n\nRevenue rose 10 percent to $19.9 billion, helped by sales of Microsoft\u2019s Office suite of applications, but fell short of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $20.7 billion.\n\nSales of Windows rose slightly, but only because of the inclusion of some deferred revenue, weighed down by an estimated 11 percent dip in PC sales in the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows 8 has sold more than 100 million licenses since launching in October, but is struggling to win over many consumers confused by the new design which is more suited to tablets than traditional PCs. Acknowledging this, Microsoft is releasing a revamped version of the system called Windows 8.1 later this year, which brings back the iconic \u2018start\u2019 button."
