        "body": "PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - French online music group Deezer is studying a commercial and industrial agreement with Korean electronics group Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which might also take a stake in its capital, a French weekly said.\n\nLe Journal du Dimanche also reported that French video-sharing website Dailymotion, owned by French telecoms operator Orange, is in talks with software maker Microsoft about a stake in its capital.\n\nThe two French firms were not immediately available for comment.\n\nPrivately-held Deezer, created in 2006, says it has more than 12 million users worldwide and a catalog of 30 million songs, to which users can get free, unlimited access for 12 months. It also sells paying subscriptions, which offer ad-free, unlimited music streaming.\n\nThe company is one of the main competitors of Swedish online music group Spotify, which in November raised 250 million dollars from private investors.\n\nOrange Chief Executive Stephane Richard said last month that Dailymotion was close to signing a partnership in the United States and was working on another in Asia to help it to take on market leader YouTube.\n\nThough he did not name the companies, Richard said the potential U.S. partner is \u201ca major player\u201d in the digital economy and described the Asian company as \u201ca significant regional operator\u201d.\n\nOrange had been in talks with United States-based web portal Yahoo last year to sell a 75 percent stake in Dailymotion, but the deal foundered in May after France\u2019s industry minister slammed the idea of one of the country\u2019s most visible start-ups being \u201cdevoured\u201d by Americans."
