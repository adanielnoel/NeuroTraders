The memos did not mention layoffs.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is implementing changes to better serve our customers and partners,\u201d a Microsoft spokeswoman told Reuters.\n\nMedia reports have said layoffs are in order with as many as \u201cthousands\u201d of Microsoft employees set to be affected. News of a reorganization was first reported by the Puget Sound Business Journal.\n\nThe reorganization come about a year after Courtois and Althoff were promoted to lead the company\u2019s global sales and marketing operations and its worldwide commercial business following the departure of former Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner.\n\nSince then, Althoff has said it is his plan to make Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud-computing service a focal point of the company\u2019s sales strategy."
