One survivor said there was just one window the boys managed to open.\n\nTwo teachers were also killed in the fire at the Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah, a 15-minute drive from the iconic Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, police said, adding that most of the victims died from smoke inhalation.\n\nThe youngest was just seven, media said.\n\nThe disaster has renewed calls for greater scrutiny of so-called \u201ctahfiz\u201d schools, where students learn to memorize the Quran. They are unregulated by the education ministry, being the responsibility of the religious department.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said at least 31 fires had been reported at such schools in Malaysia since 2011, adding that they must follow safety regulations.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to carry out investigations, especially through forensics, as we found that there was some security features that should have been complied with but weren\u2018t,\u201d Zahid told reporters outside the school.\n\nFire department operations deputy director Soiman Jahid said the cause was likely a short circuit or a mosquito repellent coil.\n\nThe dormitory had only one entrance, leaving many of the victims trapped, he said.\n\n\u201cThe building was surrounded by metal grills that could not be opened from the inside. The students, after realizing the fire and heavy smoke, tried to escape through the window,\u201d Soiman said outside the school.\n\n\u201cBut because of the grills, they could not escape.\u201d\n\nSoiman said the school had submitted a request for fire safety approval but no new checks had been carried out as the request was still being processed.\n\n\u201cThe pupils all got locked in and they couldn\u2019t escape and got burned,\u201d Nadia Azalan, sister of a 13-year-old victim, told Reuters in tears as distraught family members gathered outside the building. \u201cSafety should come first.\u201d\n\nMohamad Arif Mawardi, 24, who was sleeping on one of the lower floors, said he realized there was a fire only after he heard people shouting.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help the others but we couldn\u2019t because the fire was rampant. There was nothing we could do,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout 13 boys managed to open a window and escape, Arif said.\n\n\u201cOnly those 13 who had access to that open window could escape,\u201d he said.\n\nA man identified only as Hazin, who lived next door to the school, said his son called the fire department after they heard screams and saw the flames.\n\n\u201cThe children were crying for help, but I couldn\u2019t help them as the door was already on fire,\u201d he said.\n\nViewed from outside, the only tell-tale signs of disaster were the blackened upper-floor windows, otherwise the tin-roofed building appeared unscathed, with a Malaysian flag hanging limply from the yellow wall.\n\nOnly inside did the intensity of the inferno become clear. The dormitory was blackened, lined with the charred frames of bunk beds.\n\nTahfiz schools have been under scrutiny since earlier this year when an 11-year-old boy died after reported abuse in Johor, north of Singapore."
