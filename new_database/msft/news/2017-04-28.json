        "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s lineup of Surface tablets, laptops and desktop computers has always been a paradox.\n\nThe software company\u2019s surprise foray into hardware became a billion-dollar-plus business and even managed to outclass longtime rival Apple Inc with its Surface Studio desktop machine last fall, according to some tech critics.\n\nAt the same time, the Surface range competes with Microsoft\u2019s longstanding PC maker partners, such as Dell Technologies, Lenovo Group Ltd and HP Inc, which pay billions of dollars to license Windows, Microsoft\u2019s traditional cash cow.\n\nThose two facets came into sharp relief in the latest quarter, when Surface sales suffered while Microsoft\u2019s own Windows licensing customers prospered.\n\nSurface revenue declined 26 percent to $831 million, its lowest tally in a year. Meanwhile, the overall PC industry staged a slight comeback, notching a 0.6 percent gain in shipments for the first time in years, according to IDC. That helped drive Microsoft\u2019s Windows licensing revenue up 5 percent this quarter.\n\nEffectively, Microsoft lost in Surface sales, but it gained in Windows licensing.\n\nIt has always been part of Microsoft\u2019s Surface strategy to release flagship models that goad the rest of the PC industry to improve its products, said Microsoft investor relations director Zack Moxcey.\n\nHe said competition from PC makers selling lower-priced hardware, along with some Surface hardware nearing time for an upgrade, led to the lower Surface sales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely about driving the health and performance of the broader windows ecosystem,\u201d Moxcey said.\n\nBuried in the supplemental information Microsoft provides investors, there was further silver lining. The company said sales of Windows licenses destined for consumer PCs was down 1 percent, but revenue for more lucrative Windows licenses for business and educational computers was up 10 percent.\n\nMoxcey said this was attributable to sales of higher-priced machines, especially for businesses. \u201cThat carries a higher revenue-per-license for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe data fits with Dell\u2019s latest results, as the PC maker\u2019s sales of computers to businesses rose 11.6 percent year over year to $6.6 billion in its last quarter, versus 8.5 percent growth for consumer PCs.\n\nRebounding sales of Windows PCs to schools and businesses is a boon for Microsoft, which is staking its comeback on business and productivity software.\n\nAnd higher Windows revenue per license means that the Surface strategy - to pull the PC industry back upmarket with expensive flagship machines after a years-long race to the bottom on prices - might be getting some traction."

We apologize for the error.\u201d\n\nA Microsoft spokeswoman said human error was the cause of the misreported numbers.\n\nThe U.S. government allows companies to report the volume of FISA requests only in wide bands rather than specific numbers.\n\nThe scope of spying authority granted to U.S. intelligence agencies under FISA has come under renewed scrutiny in recent weeks, sparked in part by evolving, unsubstantiated assertions from President Donald Trump and other Republicans that the Obama White House improperly spied on Trump and his associates.\n\nFISA orders, which are approved by judges who sit on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, are tightly guarded national security secrets. Even the existence of a specific FISA order is rarely disclosed publicly.\n\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this month that the Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained a FISA order to monitor the communications of former Trump adviser Carter Page as part of an investigation into possible links between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nParts of FISA will expire at the end of the year, unless U.S. lawmakers vote to reauthorize it. Privacy advocates in Congress have been working to attach new transparency and oversight reforms to any FISA legislation, and to limit government searches of American data that is incidentally collected during foreign surveillance operations.\n\nMicrosoft also for the first time published a national security letter in its transparency report, a type of warrantless surveillance order used by the FBI.\n\nOther technology companies, including Twitter Inc and Yahoo Inc, have also disclosed national security letters in recent months under a transparency measure of the USA Freedom Act that was enacted into law by the U.S. Congress in 2015."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - To understand why it is so difficult to defend computers from even moderately capable hackers, consider the case of the security flaw officially known as CVE-2017-0199.\n\nThe bug was unusually dangerous but of a common genre: it was in Microsoft software, could allow a hacker to seize control of a personal computer with little trace, and was fixed April 11 in Microsoft\u2019s regular monthly security update.\n\nBut it had traveled a rocky, nine-month journey from discovery to resolution, which cyber security experts say is an unusually long time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s security researchers, for example, give vendors just 90 days\u2019 warning before publishing flaws they find. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) declined to say how long it usually takes to patch a flaw.\n\nWhile Microsoft investigated, hackers found the flaw and manipulated the software to spy on unknown Russian speakers, possibly in Ukraine.\n\nFacebook says it will act against 'information operations' using false accounts\n\nAnd a group of thieves used it to bolster their efforts to steal from millions of online bank accounts in Australia and other countries.\n\nThose conclusions and other details emerged from interviews with researchers at cyber security firms who studied the events and analyzed versions of the attack code.\n\nThe tale began last July, when Ryan Hanson, a 2010 Idaho State University graduate and consultant at boutique security firm Optiv Inc in Boise, found a weakness in the way that Microsoft Word processes documents from another format. That allowed him to insert a link to a malicious program that would take control of a computer.\n\nHanson spent some months combining his find with other flaws to make it more deadly, he said on Twitter. Then in October he told Microsoft. The company often pays a modest bounty of a few thousands dollars for the identification of security risks.\n\nSoon after that point six months ago, Microsoft could have fixed the problem, the company acknowledged. But it was not that simple. A quick change in the settings on Word by customers would do the trick, but if Microsoft notified customers about the bug and the recommended changes, it would also be telling hackers about how to break in.\n\nAlternatively, Microsoft could have created a patch that would be distributed as part of its monthly software updates. But the company did not patch immediately and instead dug deeper. It was not aware that anyone was using Hanson\u2019s method, and it wanted to be sure it had a comprehensive solution.\n\n\u201cWe performed an investigation to identify other potentially similar methods and ensure that our fix addresses [sic] more than just the issue reported,\u201d Microsoft said through a spokesman, who answered emailed questions on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThis was a complex investigation.\u201d\n\nThe saga shows that Microsoft\u2019s progress on security issues, as well as that of the software industry as a whole, remains uneven in an era when the stakes are growing dramatically.\n\nThe United States has accused Russia of hacking political party emails to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, a charge Russia denies, while shadowy hacker groups opposed to the U.S. government have been publishing hacking tools used by the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency.\n\nIt is unclear how the unknown hackers initially found Hanson\u2019s bug. It could have been through simultaneous discovery, a leak in the patching process, or even hacking against Optiv or Microsoft.\n\nIn January, as Microsoft worked on a solution, the attacks began.\n\nThe first known victims were sent emails enticing them to click on a link to documents in Russian about military issues in Russia and areas held by Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, researchers said. Their computers were then infected with eavesdropping software made by Gamma Group, a private company that sells to agencies of many governments.\n\nThe best guess of cyber security experts is that one of Gamma\u2019s customers was trying to get inside the computers of soldiers or political figures in Ukraine or Russia; either of those countries, or any of their neighbors or allies, could have been responsible. Such government espionage is routine.\n\nThe initial attacks were carefully aimed at a small number of targets and so stayed below the radar. But in March, security researchers at FireEye Inc (FEYE.O) noticed that a notorious piece of financial hacking software known as Latenbot was being distributed using the same Microsoft bug.\n\nFireEye probed further, found the earlier Russian-language attacks, and warned Microsoft. The company, which confirmed it was first warned of active attacks in March, got on track for an April 11 patch.\n\nThen, what counts as disaster in the world of bug-fixers struck. Another security firm, McAfee, saw some attacks using the Microsoft Word flaw on April 6.\n\nAfter what it described as \u201cquick but in-depth research,\u201d it established that the flaw had not been patched, contacted Microsoft, and then blogged about its discovery on April 7.\n\nThe blog post contained enough detail that other hackers could mimic the attacks.\n\nOther software security professionals were aghast that McAfee did not wait, as Optiv and FireEye were doing, until the patch came out.\n\nMcAfee Vice President Vincent Weafer blamed \u201ca glitch in our communications with our partner Microsoft\u201d for the timing. He did not elaborate.\n\nBy April 9, a program to exploit the flaw was on sale on underground markets for criminal hackers, said FireEye researcher John Hultquist.\n\nThe next day, attacks were mainstream. Someone used it to send documents booby-trapped with Dridex banking-fraud software to millions of computers in Australia.\n\nFinally, on the Tuesday, about six months after hearing from Hanson, Microsoft made the patch available. As always, some computer owners are lagging behind and have not installed it.\n\nBen-Gurion University employees in Israel were hacked, after the patch, by attackers linked to Iran who took over their email accounts and sent infected documents to their contacts at technology companies and medical professionals, said Michael Gorelik, vice president of cyber security firm Morphisec.\n\nWhen Microsoft patched, it thanked Hanson, a FireEye researcher and its own staff.\n\nA six-month delay is bad but not unheard of, said Marten Mickos, chief executive of HackerOne, which coordinates patching efforts between researchers and vendors.\n\n\u201cNormal fixing times are a matter of weeks,\u201d Mickos said.\n\nPrivately-held Optiv said through a spokeswoman that it usually gives vendors 45 days to make fixes before publishing research when appropriate, and that it \u201cmaterially followed\u201d that practice in this case.\n\nOptiv is now comparing the details of what Hanson told Microsoft with what the spies and criminals used in the wild, trying to find out if the researcher\u2019s work was partly responsible for the worldwide hacking spree, the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe spree included one or more people who created a hacking tool for what FireEye\u2019s Hultquist said is probably a national government - and then appearing to double-dip by also selling it to a criminal group.\n\nIf the patching took time, others who learned of the flaw moved quickly.\n\nOn the final weekend before the patch, the criminals could have sold it along to the Dridex hackers, or the original makers could have cashed in a third time, Hultquist said, effectively staging a last clearance sale before it lost peak effectiveness.\n\nIt is unclear how many people were ultimately infected or how much money was stolen."
