That was the first time the Xbox 360 has beaten the Sony console in monthly sales in Japan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done better than we forecast. We are finding that we have a shortage of hardware,\u201d John Schappert, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president overseeing its online game services and game software, told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe are raising our forecast\u201d for Xbox 360 hardware shipments to Japan, he said, though he declined to give specific figures.\n\nBesides the price cut, demand for the Xbox 360 got a boost in Japan from the recent launches of popular role-playing games for the Microsoft console, such as Square Enix Holdings\u2019 (9684.T) \u201cInfinite Undiscovery\u201d and Namco Bandai Holdings\u2019 (7832.T) \u201cTales of Vesperia\u201d.\n\nAction or fighting games tend to sell well in the United States, while in Japan role-playing games often dominate the bestseller lists.\n\n\u201cRelationships we\u2019ve formed over the eight years of doing business with our Japanese partners really are paying dividends now as we see legendary franchises coming and making their new home on the Xbox 360,\u201d Schappert said.\n\nNamco Bandai said on Thursday it would launch the next version of its popular fighting game series \u201cTekken\u201d for both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 next year. Namco Bandai has launched the previous installments of \u201cTekken\u201d for Sony machines as well as for mobile phones. In another recent coup, Microsoft said in July Square Enix would launch the \u201cFinal Fantasy XIII\u201d for its console, sharing the upcoming version of the blockbuster role-playing game with the PS3.\n\nPrior to the announcement, Square Enix had only said it was developing the next installment of its hugely popular \u201cFinal Fantasy\u201d series for the Sony console."

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - A small Yahoo Inc YHOO.O investor proposed a new deal on Thursday to sell the company to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for $22 a share, a 74 percent premium to the Web pioneer\u2019s current stock price.\n\nUnder the proposal by investment fund Mithras Capital, Microsoft would unload Yahoo\u2019s Asian assets and non-search businesses, extract $3 billion worth of cost savings and receive $2.8 billion of tax benefits, meaning the software giant would pay $10.3 billion for Yahoo\u2019s search business.\n\nMithras Capital, which owns more than 1.9 million shares, or 0.14 percent, of Yahoo, said in a press release that the proposal allows Microsoft to buy Yahoo\u2019s search business for $2 billion less than it offered in July.\n\nTalks between the two companies broke off in July after Yahoo rejected Microsoft\u2019s proposal to buy its search business and enact a revenue sharing partnership. Yahoo also rebuffed a full acquisition offer from Microsoft in May.\n\nMark Nelson, partner of Mithras Capital, said he plans to send a letter proposing the deal to Microsoft and Yahoo Thursday night.\n\nMicrosoft executives have said the chances of it buying Yahoo are \u201cnegligible,\u201d but that was before a decline in the price of Yahoo shares, which has fallen on concerns that the financial crisis and slumping economy could hurt its business.\n\nYahoo shares are down 36 percent since the start of August, falling to new five-year lows on Thursday. The stock decline has investors looking to revive talks with Microsoft, which is looking to close the gap on search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O).\n\n\u201cAs Yahoo shares decline and Microsoft struggles in its online services business, it is increasingly likely Microsoft will make a new offer,\u201d American Technology Research analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. He has a buy rating on Yahoo with a $22 target price.\n\nThe proposal also calls for Yahoo\u2019s board to drop its poison pill preventing such a tender offer, while valuing Yahoo\u2019s Asian assets at $7.2 billion and its non-search business at $4.5 billion.\n\nYahoo, which ceded three board seats to activist investor Carl Icahn in August, has been involved in ongoing talks with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) about buying its AOL unit, according to a source briefed on the situation.\n\nYahoo also has delayed the start of a search advertising partnership with Google while it sorts out regulatory concerns about the deal.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for Microsoft to act now, while the Yahoo-Google deal is mired in regulatory concerns, and before Yahoo strikes a deal with AOL,\u201d said Mark Nelson, a partner at Mithras.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for the Yahoo board to embrace this proposal as the best outcome for long-suffering Yahoo shareholders,\u201d Nelson said in a news release.\n\nShares of Microsoft closed down 3.09 percent to $22.30 on the Nasdaq while Yahoo stock fell 8.07 percent to $12.65 in Thursday trade."

        "body": "CHIBA, Japan (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said sales of its Xbox 360 game console are beating projections in Japan, prompting the company to raise its shipment forecast for the country, a stronghold for Sony Corp and Nintendo Co Ltd.\n\nGlobal demand for the Xbox 360 has not been dented by the financial crisis, and the game machine is well positioned to attract holiday shoppers thanks to its recent price cuts, said John Schappert, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president overseeing its online game services and game software.\n\nJapan, home to two of its biggest rivals, Sony and Nintendo, has traditionally been a tough market to crack for the U.S. software giant\u2019s game operations.\n\nBut Microsoft in September lowered the price of its Xbox 360 in Japan, helping the game machine outsell Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3 in the month. That was the first time the Xbox 360 has beaten the Sony console in monthly sales in Japan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done better than we forecast.

No better time to have that.\u201d\n\nRival Sony said on Thursday it will launch a PS3 model with an 80 gigabyte hard disk drive in Japan on October 30 for 39,980 yen ($398), beefing up its hardware ahead of the gift-giving period.\n\nSony currently offers the 40 gigabyte model for the same price in Japan, compared with the 25,000 yen price tag for the Wii, and the Xbox 360\u2019s high-end Elite model, which sells for 39,800 yen."
