        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Getty Images Inc [GETTY.UL] has failed to convince a federal judge to halt Microsoft Corp\u2019s Bing Image Widget, which it said enabled massive copyright infringement, because the software company had already taken it down voluntarily.\n\nThe multimedia photo and video agency sued Microsoft on Sept. 4 over the widget, which it said permitted the display of images without giving their owners a licensing fee or attribution. Getty owns or represents the owners of more than 80 million digital images.\n\nGetty asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan to slap Microsoft with an injunction on the new product. Even though Microsoft removed the widget the day after the lawsuit was filed, Getty pressed forward with its case.\n\nGetty told Cote not to believe Microsoft\u2019s claims that it would not relaunch the widget because it did not rule out creating a new widget that could still infringe on Getty\u2019s content.\n\n\u201cThis argument is purely speculative,\u201d Cote said in her ruling on Thursday, adding that there was no basis to question Microsoft\u2019s word on its future conduct.\n\n\u201cWe would have preferred a judicial mandate for (the widget) to stay down,\u201d said John Lapham, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cBut the question of whether or not you\u2019re allowed to take and use somebody else\u2019s copyrighted materials without any attribution or compensation is still live and before the court.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft told Getty during the lawsuit that if it did launch a similar product in the future, it would include \u201csearch filters, attribution notices\u201d and other details important to copyright.\n\nRepresentatives from Microsoft could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe case is Getty Images Inc v. Microsoft Corp, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 14-7114."
