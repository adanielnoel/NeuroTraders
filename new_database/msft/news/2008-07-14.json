Advertisers and online content providers would be harmed through price coordination that will establish higher prices and limit choice,\u201d said Smith.\n\n\u201cConsumers would be put at risk as Google expands its ability to collect the personal information of users passing through its search gateway. On an even more fundamental level, Google\u2019s monopoly power would increase its ability to shape what people get to see and experience online.\u201d\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee will hold a similar hearing later on Tuesday.

It remains unclear whether Microsoft had previously put a revenue guarantee amount on the table.\n\nMicrosoft and Yahoo officials declined comment. Icahn did not return a call seeking comment."

        "body": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) traded new accusations on Monday over the latest breakdown in deal talks, as the battle for control of Yahoo heated up ahead of an August 1 showdown.\n\nActivist investor Carl Icahn, leading a proxy campaign to dump Yahoo\u2019s current management and board at the August shareholder meeting, blasted Yahoo for rejecting a joint proposal he made with Microsoft that he said contained enhanced protections to Yahoo and its investors.\n\nAll three parties were involved in talks on Friday on a new Microsoft offer to buy Yahoo\u2019s search business and take a 14 percent stake in the Web pioneer if it agreed to shed its Asian assets and focus on its remaining businesses.\n\nDuring the negotiations, according to Icahn, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Yahoo\u2019s concerns over who would control the company were a distraction from the deal at hand. \u201c\u2018First, tell us if you like the deal,\u201d\u2019 Icahn quoted Ballmer as saying.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft and Mr. Icahn are trying to dismantle the company and deliver our search business to Microsoft on terms that would be disadvantageous to Yahoo stockholders,\u201d Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock said of the latest Microsoft offer.\n\nYahoo turned down that offer Saturday night, complaining that it had only 24 hours to consider a deal it called financially inferior and more risky than its current business prospects and a search ad partnership with rival Google Inc (GOOG.O).\n\nYahoo also said it was now open to a full-scale merger with Microsoft if it offered at least $33 a share.\n\nYahoo shares closed down $1, or 4.2 percent, to close at $22.57, while Microsoft shares fell 10 cents, or 0.4 percent, to close at $25.15, both on Nasdaq.\n\nSandeep Aggarwal, an Internet sector analyst with brokerage Collins Stewart, said investors are discounting the prospect of a full-scale Microsoft merger.\n\n\u201cWhat is becoming increasingly clear is that Microsoft\u2019s heart is set on Yahoo search,\u201d Aggarwal said.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft said it made the new offer in response to a request for a new proposal from Bostock.\n\nMicrosoft denied it set a 24-hour ultimatum, saying it was seeking only a commitment by Yahoo to accept the framework and agree to a timeline to move to intensive talks.\n\nIcahn said Microsoft\u2019s new offer provided assurances to Yahoo of $2.3 billion in annual search revenue for up to 10 years, assuming Yahoo\u2019s audience remains intact and the parties agree to renew. Yahoo said the offer, with all of its conditions, would leave it at the mercy of Microsoft.\n\nIcahn said Microsoft\u2019s offer valued Yahoo at $33 per share, which included a proposal for Microsoft to tender $3.9 billion for 14 percent of Yahoo.\n\nThe offer assumed Yahoo could realize $9 a share on its Asian assets, Microsoft would provide debt financing worth $2 a share, leaving around $16.73 for the remainder of Yahoo, Icahn said in a U.S. financial regulatory filing.\n\nThe latest proposal follows six months of on-again, off-again talks that started when Microsoft made an unsolicited $31-per-share cash-and-stock offer to buy Yahoo in late January. Microsoft then raised its offer to $33 per share, or $47.5 billion, before pulling that bid in May when Yahoo\u2019s leaders said they would not settle for less than $37 a share.\n\nIcahn mocked Yahoo\u2019s current willingness to accept a Microsoft buyout of around $33 a share, after rejecting the same a few months back: \u201cIt is hard to understand why it (Yahoo) turned down $33 and is now willing to accept it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the past month, Yahoo\u2019s bargaining power has come down dramatically,\u201d Aggarwal said. \u201cClearly, from Yahoo\u2019s perspective, they were working on a certain set of wrong assumptions about Microsoft\u2019s willingness to buy it.\u201d\n\nBut Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay disagreed, saying the latest push by Microsoft and Icahn to reach a deal with Yahoo appeared to have been a long-shot attempt to reach a last-minute deal or, more likely, a way of gaining ammunition in its August 1 proxy vote.\n\nLindsay said Icahn and Microsoft may have overplayed their hand by giving Yahoo the chance to look reasonable by saying it was willing to sell the company for as little as $33.\n\nWhile acting in concert with Microsoft, Icahn has failed to answer questions about whether he will have any serious negotiating power with Microsoft if he succeeds in removing Yahoo\u2019s board and Yang as CEO, the analyst said.\n\n\u201cFor investors to get behind Icahn they have to be convinced that he has a credible alternative,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nIcahn, who controls about 5 percent of Yahoo shares, has nominated a slate of nine directors to replace Yahoo\u2019s board and oust CEO Jerry Yang on August 1.\n\nYang would remain at the company as \u201cChief Yahoo,\u201d according to Icahn, who also said he was open to discussing keeping a number of the current board members.\n\nYang co-founded the pioneering Web company in 1994 and held the irreverent executive-without-portfolio title until becoming CEO in 2007."

The LG box is expected to be available in the second half of the year.\n\nRumors of a partnership with Microsoft have swirled in the blogosphere since last year, when Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings joined Microsoft\u2019s board of directors and Netflix began surveying subscribers about their interest in accessing movies through an Xbox.\n\nNetflix has more than 8.2 million subscribers.
