        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted stronger-than-expected quarterly results and cut its outlook by less than investors had feared amid the economic slump, sending its shares higher.\n\nOther technology companies that reported quarterly results on Thursday include Flextronics International Ltd, Ingram Micro Inc and Juniper Networks Inc.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft reported a very solid Q1. What people were expecting was for them to take down guidance and they did. But it was only marginally lower. I think people were expecting much worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone was worried about the guidance. If you are a Microsoft investor you should be happy that Microsoft thinks they will weather the storm relatively well.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at Microsoft for is their outlook for how business are doing, and it seems as if their business-oriented division did pretty well in the quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re guiding down. Microsoft likes to set achievable goals for themselves. But I do think that spending overall is going to be muted in the future and this is what they\u2019re trying to portray.\u201d\n\n\u201dBasically I would say that we\u2019re pleased. The company continues to set reasonable expectations and meet or beat them as they did here. The expectation was that they would bring down guidance, they only did that in a modest way. They seem to have a grasp on all their business.\n\n\u201dThe company\u2019s balance sheet is very strong. It\u2019s critical to put this in perspective- the stock is down about 30 percent in the year, it\u2019s coming down close to where people thought it\u2019d be. In our opinion, the decline is a massive overshoot on the reality of the business. They have a spectacular balance sheet and a huge market share, that\u2019s rare for a company this size.\n\n\u201cI think that over the next 12 months the stock will move meaningfully higher and get back in the $30 range. The key is that it is doing well in a very difficult environment. The outlook is very, very reasonable and it allows for very good earnings. It\u2019s important to remember that Microsoft historically is very conservative in its outlook. If the company is shaving the outlook, there is a very good chance that it could beat it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople had already factored in that guidance would be lower. At about $22, it had been literally trading at a rock bottom price for Microsoft, given the potential that the company has.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody has factored in that macro conditions are bad, so I think people are now going to focus on what the company can do today to put it in a stronger position one or two years from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext week Microsoft is going to make many announcements regarding cloud initiatives and services that Microsoft will initiate over the next two years. Historically Microsoft has been a laggard. They missed on the Internet, they missed on search. But the cloud is probably a place where they can lead the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks good. Every business unit exceeded expectations except for the Windows Vista business, which was a little bit light. Online was about 10 percent more than expected. Xbox was good. The business division was really good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big thing is that they guided down for the remainder of the fiscal year. Given the backdrop, that\u2019s not a huge surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, pretty much everything that Microsoft sells is the lowest price product in its category. Xbox, ads on MSN, Office, SQL server, Windows Server. Every product they sell is the cheapest in their category. That certainly helps them out in this environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody was concerned about guidance and it seems to be kind of in line to slightly better than what the Street was fearing so I think the fear factor is subsiding a little. So from that standpoint I think it was a relief for some investors.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically there is caution and their guidance is just reflecting that caution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been covering the stock eight years. This is the first time the company has not given revenue or earnings guidance. This is a sign visibility is extremely limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise because nobody seems to have any visibility in demand whether it\u2019s the distributors or the suppliers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a virtual freeze on IT spending at corporate clients.\u201d\n\nHe said the results themselves were as bad as expected.\n\n\u201cThe guidance they offered for topline and EPS was weaker than anyone anticipated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey generally see a pretty big ramp of their handset and consumer electronics business. That may not be occurring.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing lower-than-normal and very cautionary order patterns from original equipment manufacturers with regards to products being sold to the consumer.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe bottomline takeaway is, caution on the market is resulting in lower-than-normal demand forecasts and negatively impacting profitability.\n\n\u201cThe results were probably better than what people expected. Things slowed a little in September but not until the end of the quarter. But the outlook for December was lower than people were expecting a month or two ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mobile unit is doing well. The infrastructure unit is down. Given Ericsson\u2019s good results, that points to Nortel.\u201d\n\nHe said the third-quarter revenue guidance of $8 billion to $9 billion is an unusually wide range, suggesting that it does not have a clear view of demand.\n\n\u201cThe challenging thing is that it looks like Flextronics is also trying to put its arms around how long and deep the downturn is as reflected by their revenue outlook.\u201d"

        "body": "SEATTLE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported better than expected quarterly profit and reduced its outlook less than many investors had feared in the face of tough economic conditions.\n\nWhile demand for its products softened near the end of the September quarter as uncertainty from financial crisis took hold, Microsoft said new releases of computer server software and database software pushed revenue higher.\n\n\u201cInvestors were prepared for the worst given the credit crisis. Investors should be pleased with Microsoft\u2019s decent first quarter and only a modest reduction in full-year 2009 guidance,\u201d said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones.\n\nMicrosoft posted a net profit of $4.37 billion, or 48 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 versus a profit of $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted share, in the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts, on average, were forecasting Microsoft to earn 47 cents per share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software maker said it saw technology spending deteriorate in September, with that downturn extending into October. The company expects the spending slowdown to continue until the end of its fiscal year in June.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a more conservative stance going forward. That\u2019s clearly appropriate given all the news we see and what we see out there in the market,\u201d Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nFor the full-year ending June 2009, Microsoft forecast earnings per share to range between $2.00 to $2.10 on revenue from $64.9 billion to $66.4 billion. Microsoft\u2019s previous estimates called for earnings per share from $2.12 to $2.18 and revenue ranging from $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion.\n\nWall Street analysts were already forecasting earnings more conservative than the company\u2019s own previous estimates. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts, on average, forecast Microsoft to earn $2.11 per share on revenue of $66.4 billion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re guiding down. Microsoft likes to set achievable goals for themselves,\u201d said Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.\n\nFor the December quarter, traditionally Microsoft\u2019s biggest quarter by revenue, the company forecast earnings per share to range between 51 cents and 53 cents on revenue between $17.3 billion and $17.8 billion.\n\nAnalysts were forecasting Microsoft to report earnings per share of 55 cents on revenue of $17.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Liddell said it plans to lower expenses by $500 million compared to its original spending plans through scaling back new hires, reducing travel and lowering marketing costs.\n\nHe also said the company plans to reduce capital expenditures this year on items such as data centers to $3.7 billion from an original estimate for $4 billion.\n\n\u201cIf macroeconomic conditions worsen, we will adjust operating expenses accordingly,\u201d Liddell said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nMicrosoft executives have said in recent weeks that the company is not immune to a downturn in spending from consumers and corporate customers even as they promote the view that the company\u2019s products and markets are diverse enough to better withstand an industry downturn than its rivals.\n\n\u201cEvery business unit exceeded expectations except for the Windows Vista business, which was a little bit light,\u201d said Katherine Egbert, analyst at Jefferies & Co.\n\nRevenue at the Windows business rose 2 percent, while the unit\u2019s operating profit fell 4 percent due to the growing popularity of low-end laptop computers called netbooks. Microsoft sells as many copies of Windows for netbooks as for other machines, but makes less money per unit.\n\nThe server and tools division posted a 17 percent rise in revenue, while operating income rose 20 percent. The Office business division reported a 20 percent gain in revenue and a 23 percent surge in profit.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at Microsoft for is their outlook for how business are doing, and it seems as if their business-oriented division did pretty well in the quarter,\u201d said Fort Pitt Capital\u2019s Caughey.\n\nThe company, which announced a $40 billion share buyback plan in September, again reiterated that it plans to grow revenue faster than the broader technology industry.\n\nShares of Microsoft have fallen 19 percent since it last reported earnings on July 17. Microsoft stock closed at $22.32, up 3.7 percent, on the Nasdaq. They remained mostly unchanged in extended trade."
