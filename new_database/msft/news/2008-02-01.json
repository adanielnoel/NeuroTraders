        "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Bad blood between the European Commission and Microsoft could affect the EU scrutiny of a bid by the software giant for Yahoo, legal experts said on Friday.\n\nMicrosoft has made an unsolicited $44.6 billion offer to buy Yahoo and is confident of winning regulatory approval. Yahoo said its board will evaluate the offer.\n\nClearance from the European Commission as the EU\u2019s top competition regulator would likely be needed for a merger of this size and cross-border impact, though it declined to make any comment on Friday.\n\nLast year, the Commission won a bruising court battle against Microsoft that forced the software giant to comply with a landmark 2004 antitrust decision by the EU executive.\n\nLawyers said Brussels may welcome increased competition against Google but privacy will be a concern.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always difficult going into a deal if you have got a sort of unhappy history in a way with the Commission,\u201d Catriona Hatton, a partner at law firm Hogan & Hartson, said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the best way to come in with a merger deal,\u201d Hatton said.\n\nHans Friederiszick of ESMT Competition Analysis, part of the Berlin-based international business school, said competition and privacy will loom large for Brussels.\n\n\u201cThis merger will reduce the number of search engine providers with significant global reach from three to two, paving the way for a tight duopoly in these markets,\u201d said Friederiszick, who is a former senior official at the Commission\u2019s competition unit.\n\n\u201cIn turn, Google may welcome this move as it allows Google to argue that its likely dominant position is contested by an equally strong player,\u201d Friederiszick said.\n\n\u201cIn any case, one barrier for the proposed merger to get approved may be the relationship between the Commission and Microsoft, following its strategic use and abuse of interoperability,\u201d he added.\n\nBrussels was also likely to stress that Yahoo\u2019s portal services should not be bundled up with Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system on personal computers, said Christopher Thomas, a partner at Lovells law firms.\n\nJonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, which has received support from Microsoft, said the combined market share in online advertising and searches would still be significantly lower than Google\u2018s.\n\n\u201cThe Commission obviously has to review a number of different aspects of the merger. Given their pro-consumer bent they are going to have to think about competition on privacy issues, for example,\u201d Zuck said.\n\nA merger was probably doable but remedies of some sort would be likely, Hatton said.\n\nMuch could hinge on how well EU and U.S. competition authorities see eye to eye on the deal, lawyers said.\n\nCritics in the United States have said Brussels seems to prefer protecting competitors over promoting competition.\n\nStill, antitrust officials on both sides of the Atlantic have learned to cooperate since a bitter split in 2001 when Washington approved an all-American deal of GE buying Honeywell only to see Brussels reject it."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp, the software giant, said on Friday it had offered to acquire Internet media company Yahoo Inc in a proposed cash and stock deal valued at $44.6 billion.\n\nMicrosoft said it had offered to buy Yahoo for $31 per share, which it said represented a 62 percent premium above the company\u2019s closing stock price on Nasdaq on Thursday.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s about time. Great for Microsoft. Great for Yahoo shareholders. These Internet markets are winner-take-all markets and they cannot be built. Time is too valuable. Yahoo has one of the best positions on the Internet because it\u2019s integrated brand (advertising) with search.\n\n\u201dThere could be a little more money on the table. The company is in play. Yahoo will not be able to stay independent. Other bidders will emerge before this is over. Not Google -- they can\u2019t even get DoubleClick closed, they won\u2019t get Yahoo closed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in a pole position in several major industries. I expect News (Corp), Comcast, and GE will look at it. But Microsoft is paying a lot because they\u2019re trying to scare away other bidders.\u201d\n\nTIM SMALLS, HEAD OF U.S. STOCK TRADING AT BROKERAGE FIRM EXECUTION LLC IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT\n\n\u201dShocking! To me, the premium seems exorbitant, for what is a dwindling business. I personally don\u2019t see how the synergies of Microsoft-Yahoo is going to take on Google.\n\n\u201dIt will obviously help the stock market immensely -- the overall market loves a big deal, here you go, and the futures are screaming.\n\n\u201cThis is going to take everybody\u2019s attention today. Especially in a distressed market, if you get a financial deal or a technology deal, that\u2019s really going to captivate the market and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got right now.\u201d\n\n\u201dThey have to do it because they\u2019ve tried everything they can do to fix MSN. Yahoo is the most visited site in the world, so it goes without saying that given the current valuation, this is the perfect time for them to buy it.\n\n\u201dGoogle is running away with the search market and that\u2019s obviously the best part of the market. The likelihood that Google gets caught is slim to none.\n\n\u201cYou might not catch Google, but you can still be a legitimate player.\u201d\n\n\u201dYahoo! delivers Microsoft a well-known web entity with a strong user base (particularly in the US), one of the largest email user communities and a wealth of other assets such as photosharing website Flickr.\n\n\u201dYahoo!\u2019s considerable expertise and assets in online advertising (such as its Panama platform) is relevant both in the fixed and mobile worlds. Its notable that Yahoo! already had deals with a number of mobile network operators around the world including Vodafone and T-Mobile in the UK.\n\n\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s wanted to do things that could build up its online business dramatically. This is one more thing that allows them to do that.\n\n\u201dThis is going to be a big bet for them. But I also think it\u2019s where they see the market going, so they really needed to get there.\n\n\u201dThis is more than a shot across the bow at Google, because you put these two guys together who are basically two and three in search and makes them far more relevant.\n\nMARK MAY, ANALYST AT NEEDHAM & COMPANY IN NEW YORK\n\n\u201dI think the issue is going to be one of valuation. While a substantial premium to their recent trading price, this is in line with Yahoo\u2019s average trading value over the last two years. Looked at that way, it\u2019s not a substantial premium.\n\n\u201dYou\u2019ve got a company that is in the midst of a turnaround. You\u2019re going to have this battle between of investors that believe in Jerry Yang\u2019s new vision and new strategy and investors that don\u2019t believe in that strategy. I would not be surprised to see this bid have to be raised over time.\n\n\u201cI think there are companies out there like Comcast and Viacom and others that still need to address the emergence of online media and haven\u2018t. So there are clearly other strategic companies out there, mainly traditional media companies, that should, and based on reports, have looked at Yahoo in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201dWe think it is great for Yahoo shareholders. This consolidates the marketplace down to Google versus Microsoft. Their multiple areas overlap -- not just search but also applications. Google\u2019s been pushing hard into the application space.\n\n\u201dYahoo mail continues to be much slower than the Gmail product. Yahoo search continues to lose share to Google.\n\nAsked whether Google might counterbid for Yahoo he said, \u201cThere is really nothing there that Google wants that they (Google) don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\u201dMicrosoft has been getting more aggressive with acquisitions. We\u2019ve seen them start to step up and buy large public players. Strategically, it makes sense.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s a fair price. Clearly Yahoo shares have been under pressure. Microsoft wants to get it done, and get it done quickly. Trying to offer them a 10 percent premium would be kind of foolish. You\u2019d create a problem, you\u2019d let other bidders get into the fray.\n\n\u201dThat seems to be eclipsing everything and set the futures off and running. That\u2019s obviously important to the (stock) market. It\u2019s been looking for something like this for quite some time, and it\u2019s offsetting the Google news from last night. So this is good timing on Microsoft\u2019s part, and discounting the bad news in the technology sector.\n\n\u201dI think (a deal) makes sense. Yahoo is having a really tough time competing against Google. Whether it\u2019s a good price, I can\u2019t see anybody else who is going to outbid Microsoft."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) offered to buy Yahoo Inc YHOO.O for $44.6 billion, in a bold bid to transform two ailing Internet businesses into a worthy competitor for market leader Google Inc (GOOG.O).\n\nIn what would be the biggest Internet deal since the ill-fated Time Warner-AOL merger, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer sent a letter to Yahoo\u2019s board on Thursday night to offer $31 per share in cash and stock.\n\nThe price is a 62 percent premium over Yahoo\u2019s Thursday close, but only about a quarter of what the Internet company was worth at the height of the dotcom bubble in 2000.\n\nYahoo would give Microsoft dominance in Web banner ads used by corporate brand advertisers. It also attracts more than 500 million people monthly to sites devoted to news, finance and sports, and Yahoo Mail is the No. 1 consumer e-mail service.\n\nThe shares of Microsoft, which has a market capitalization of about $300 billion, fell 6.6 percent as some investors worried the world\u2019s top software maker may be overpaying for Yahoo and could have a hard time getting a return on its investment.\n\nCritics say the two companies have too many overlapping businesses -- from instant messaging to email and advertising, as well as news, travel and finance sites -- and both are weak in the Web search market, where Google dominates.\n\n\u201cThey have to do it because they\u2019ve tried everything they can do to fix MSN. Yahoo is the most visited site in the world, so it goes without saying that, given the current valuation, this is the perfect time for them to buy it,\u201d said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.\n\nBut he added: \u201cGoogle is running away with the search market and that\u2019s obviously the best part of the market. The likelihood that Google gets caught is slim to none.\u201d\n\nYahoo said on Friday its board will evaluate the unsolicited offer. Its shares shot up about 48 percent to $28.33. The shares of Google, which has a market value of about $160 billion, fell 8.58 percent to close at $515.90.\n\nSpeculation about a Microsoft-Yahoo deal has swirled through the markets for more than a year, as investors looked for a joint stand against the ever more powerful Google.\n\nGoogle\u2019s share of the U.S. Web search market rose to 58.4 percent by December from 52.6 percent in January last year, while Yahoo\u2019s fell to 22.9 percent from 26.9 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s fell to 9.8 percent from 10.4 percent, according to comScore data.\n\nSkeptics say Microsoft and Yahoo have very different corporate cultures and worry about a clash such as the one that marred AOL\u2019s $182 billion purchase of Time Warner in 2001, which is seen as the worst merger in recent history. Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) is now valued at only $57 billion.\n\nThe perception is that Yahoo, an iconic Silicon Valley company with a free-flowing, fun-loving attitude, may not fit in with the button-up, competitive Microsoft, the world\u2019s biggest software maker.\n\n\u201cCulture is the big thing where people have some concerns,\u201d said Jupiter Research analyst Bobby Tulsiani. \u201cIf they have anything in common, they\u2019re both tired of losing to Google, so they can agree on that probably.\u201d\n\nCEO Ballmer, in his most aggressive move to shape the future Microsoft, said the deal would transform its money-losing Internet division, which it sees as critical to growth, into a profitable pillar of its business.\n\n\u201cWe have been losing money. Our plan here would be to not lose money in the future,\u201d he said on a conference call.\n\nBallmer said Microsoft has had on-and-off talks with Yahoo for 18 months, but was told by management a year ago that the timing was not right -- in an apparent reference to Yahoo\u2019s then Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Semel.\n\nSemel was replaced by Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang as CEO in June and resigned as chairman on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWith the Semel roadblock now gone, there is reason to think this (merger) is now likely to happen,\u201d said RBC Capital Internet analyst Jordan Rohan, noting Yahoo is running out of options in the face of a weakening business climate.\n\nUnder the proposal, Yahoo shareholders can choose to get $31 cash, or 0.9509 of a share of Microsoft common stock. The deal in aggregate must consist of one-half cash and one-half Microsoft common stock, the software maker said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s current stock price of $30.45 values Yahoo at around $30, or a rich 57 times forecast 2009 earnings, according to Reuters Estimates. In comparison, Google is trading at around 20 times forecast 2009 profit.\n\nSome analysts said Microsoft was overpaying for a company that warned earlier this week it faced \u201chead winds\u201d in 2008, forecasting revenue below Wall Street expectations.\n\n\u201cTo me, the premium seems exorbitant, for what is a dwindling business. I personally don\u2019t see how the synergies of Microsoft-Yahoo is going to take on Google,\u201d said Tim Smalls, head of U.S. stock trading at brokerage firm Execution LLC.\n\nGlobal Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said Yahoo is not worth more than $20 per share as its only worthwhile properties are Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Answers and Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut others said the price is low enough for rival bidders to emerge, noting Yahoo traded at $34.08 in late October.\n\n\u201cThere could be a little more money on the table,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Soleil-Media Metrics. \u201cThe company is in play. Yahoo will not be able to stay independent. Other bidders will emerge before this is over.\u201d\n\nAnalysts cited Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Viacom Inc VIAb.N and General Electric Co (GE.N) among possible bidders, although they also said few companies had the balance sheet to compete with Microsoft or were as natural a fit for Yahoo.\n\nAs Yahoo shares are trading close to Microsoft\u2019s valuation, it indicates few investors expect a sweeter offer.\n\nMicrosoft General Counsel Brad Smith acknowledged other bidders could emerge, but said any attempt by arch-rival Google to acquire Yahoo would face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.\n\nAntitrust experts said regulators would likely take a close look at a Microsoft-Yahoo deal, but as the two are dwarfed by Google, the deal will ultimately likely be approved.\n\nMicrosoft said the online advertising market is expected to reach nearly $80 billion by 2010 from over $40 billion in 2007. It paid $6 billion last year to buy online advertising services firm aQuantive as a bulwark against Google\u2019s growing position.\n\nThe software company forecast at least $1 billion in annual cost savings for the merged entity, from synergies in areas such as combining engineering talent.\n\nBernstein Research said the deal appeared to be less about expanded business potential and more about cost-savings that can be wrung out of shrinking redundant operations.\n\n\u201cWe are relatively comfortable with (Microsoft\u2018s) estimate of $1 billion in annual synergies. It appears to us that the majority of the synergies are on the cost side,\u201d said the note from Bernstein analysts Charles Di Bona and Jeffrey Lindsay.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS.N) and Blackstone LP (BX.N) scooped the prize banking job of advising Microsoft on the deal, according to sources familiar with the matter, while Yahoo is being advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

        "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s $44.6 billion unsolicited bid for Yahoo Inc is generous and offers shareholders of the Internet media firm an escape route from years of sub-par stock market performance, investors said on Friday.\n\nMicrosoft, the world\u2019s biggest software maker, sent a letter to Yahoo\u2019s board on Thursday night to offer $31 per share in cash and stock, a 62 percent premium over Yahoo\u2019s closing stock price that day.\n\n\u201cIt has been fairly proven out in the market that Yahoo is struggling as a standalone company,\u201d said Mike Binger, a fund manager at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis, who owns both Yahoo and Microsoft shares in client portfolios.\n\n\u201cIt would be very hard for Yahoo as a standalone entity to grow their stock to $31 in the next couple of years. From a shareholder perspective, I think it\u2019s a very fair price for the state of Yahoo\u2019s business fundamentals right now,\u201d he said.\n\nYahoo said its board would evaluate the offer. The company in the past few years has lost market share to powerful leader Google Inc in the lucrative Web search market, and saw management turnover in 2007.\n\nIts shares have traded mostly below the $30 level in the past two years and dropped below $20 in January, a far cry from $125 in early 2000, at the height of the tech bubble. Google, by comparison, is up five-fold since listing in 2004.\n\n\u201cI would be so thankful. Someone finally put me out of my misery,\u201d Gabe Birdsall, a portfolio manager at AIM Investments, said of his likely reaction to the bid if he had stayed a Yahoo shareholder.\n\nFrustrated by a lack of progress in its business goals and the lackluster stock performance, Birdsall\u2019s AIM Constellation Fund sold its Yahoo holdings more than a year ago, he said. The fund does own Microsoft shares.\n\nUnder Microsoft\u2019s proposal, Yahoo shareholders can choose to get $31 cash or 0.9509 common Microsoft shares per Yahoo share. The deal in aggregate must consist of one-half cash and one-half Microsoft common stock, the software maker said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full price, but I think they want to let people know they were serious and it\u2019s going to be very difficult for someone else to come out and offer a competing bid,\u201d Birdsall said.\n\nHe said between $7 and $12 of the $31 bid price was estimated to reflect Yahoo\u2019s holdings in its Japan unit and Chinese Internet firm Alibaba.com.\n\nYahoo shares shot up about 48 percent on Friday to $28.38. Microsoft, which had a market capitalization of about $300 billion as of Thursday, fell 6.6 percent to close at $30.45.\n\nKen Allen, an analyst tracking Microsoft at money manager T. Rowe Price, said the software company\u2019s stock fall reflected the risk the potential acquisition would bring to its otherwise steady business, even though it did make strategic sense. T. Rowe is a big shareholder in both Microsoft and Yahoo.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is correctly acknowledging that they need to get bigger and have more scale in order to compete more effectively in the online advertising market. And obviously Yahoo is the quickest and biggest way to get that scale,\u201d Allen said.\n\nOthers expressed concern about how much Microsoft offered.\n\n\u201cMaybe they felt like they needed to get something done in this space but the size of this deal does not make sense for shareholders,\u201d said Pat Becker Jr., chief investment officer at Becker Capital Management, which owns Microsoft shares."

However, the market was betting against this possibility on Friday, with Yahoo\u2019s shares trading below the offer price, at $28.31.\n\n\u201cFrom Microsoft\u2019s point of view it makes all the sense in the world to do this and they\u2019re voting with their pocket book when they put an offer in as high as they have,\u201d said Murray Beach, president of technology-focused investment bank Boston Corporate Finance.\n\n\u201cYahoo\u2019s board has to consider (it) and I think would be nuts to walk away from this offer,\u201d Beach added.\n\nFew other natural bidders for Yahoo exist except Google, who analysts said would not likely pursue Yahoo because it would be unlikely to get antitrust approval.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s deal is also seen sparking other actions across media and the Internet landscape and marks a return to transformational deals, which dropped off after market turmoil last summer hit M&A volume.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that Comcast, News Corp, maybe even GE, will convene board meetings sometime today to discuss their options,\u201d RBC analyst Jordan Rohan said on a conference call with clients, admitting that it was unlikely any other party could come up with a better offer.\n\nA News Corp source said the Rupert Murdoch-controlled company had no interest in bidding for Yahoo, despite having expressed interest last year in combining its MySpace with Yahoo. Those talks ended after Yahoo CEO Terry Semel resigned last June.\n\nStill, big media companies such as News Corp will now likely boost technology investments. \u201cI would expect Fox (Interactive Media) will do more and more acquisitions in technology so that they can play,\u201d said Rishad Tobaccowala, CEO of Denuo, a consulting arm of Publicis.\n\nHe added, \u201cBesides the big content companies that don\u2019t have enough technology and who will have to go and buy technology, the companies people see as dumb pipes ... the cable and the telcos, will want to play too.\u201d\n\nOvernight, Microsoft\u2019s bid, which values Yahoo at more than 60 times its forecast earnings for next year, boosted AOL\u2019s value on Wall Street, one analyst said, making its separation from owner Time Warner more financially palatable.\n\nApplying Microsoft\u2019s valuation of Yahoo to AOL\u2019s advertising business, Bernstein Research analyst Michael Nathanson estimated the Yahoo-Microsoft news contributed $1 per share to Time Warner\u2019s overall $23 per share value in his sum-of-the-parts estimate.\n\nSeen two years ago as a potential candidate to link up with Microsoft, Yahoo or Google, the Internet division of media conglomerate Time Warner Inc has restructured its business over the past two years into an online advertising powerhouse to court marketers who are shifting more advertising dollars online.\n\nOver the past few years, Time Warner has mulled myriad scenarios over how to improve and possibly spin off the one-time king of the Internet that failed to keep up with faster moving Google and Yahoo.\n\n\u201cStrategic interest for Yahoo bodes well for AOL,\u201d Bear Stearns analyst Spencer Wang said in a research note.\n\nSome analysts said the consummation of Microsoft\u2019s deal would drive AOL closer to Google if Microsoft and Yahoo are no longer interested in AOL.\n\nAs part of its $1 billion deal to buy a 5 percent stake in AOL, Google has an option due in July to request Time Warner buy back its stake or file for an initial public offering.\n\nBut analysts said if Microsoft and Yahoo successfully link up, AOL will be robbed of two suitors once viewed as potential bidders for AOL.\n\nOne media industry source said Barry Diller\u2019s IAC/InterActiveCorp and Comcast Corp both had looked at a deal for AOL two years ago, and speculated that they might take another look now.\n\nIn another view, the Yahoo-Microsoft news could spur AOL and others to look at buying up other advertising technology companies, including ValueClick Inc, said Linda Gridley, CEO of boutique investment bank Gridley & Co., which specializes in interactive marketing and digital media.\n\nValueClick shares surged to close nearly 7 percent higher after the news.\n\n\u201cAnyone that has a play in the online advertising or portal space will look at consolidation,\u201d said Boston Corporate Finance\u2019s Beach. He predicted Microsoft\u2019s move would drive the M&A market quite a bit."

Yahoo said on Friday its board will evaluate the offer,\n\nEvan Stewart of Zuckerman, Spaeder LLP said antitrust approval of such a deal was likely because Google was so big, the information technology field was changing so fast and barriers to entering the market were relatively low.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to see how they (regulators) could reject this,\u201d said Stewart.\n\nAntitrust enforcers on both sides of the Atlantic typically take a hard look at any merger which knocks the number of major competitors in an industry down from three to two because of the danger the remaining entity could raise prices.\n\nIn 2001, HJ Heinz Co called off its acquisition of Beech-Nut after regulators balked because it would have merged the No. 2 and No. 3 baby food makers.\n\nBut creating a stronger competitor to Google could appeal to antitrust enforcers.\n\nGoogle\u2019s 77 percent share of the global Web search market, according to Internet audience researcher comScore, vastly overshadows Yahoo, which is second at 16 percent. Microsoft is a distant third at 3.7 percent.\n\n\u201cYou want more than one dominant player,\u201d said Edward Henneberry, co-chairman of Heller Ehrman LLP\u2019s European competition practice, in a telephone interview from London.\n\nIn San Francisco, Thomas Barnett, the Justice Department\u2019s assistant attorney general for antitrust, was asked about the deal. \u201cWe are aware of it,\u201d he said tersely.\n\nSen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, said the Senate antitrust subcommittee he chairs would hold hearings into the deal if Yahoo accepted Microsoft\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cWe will need to scrutinize the deal carefully to ensure that it will not cause any harm to the competitiveness of what has been a vibrant high tech marketplace, nor negatively impact the privacy rights of Internet users,\u201d Kohl said in a statement.\n\nBut Henneberry said he expected that both European and U.S. regulators would put aside concerns expressed by privacy advocates. \u201cThe privacy issues aren\u2019t really competition issues.\u201d"

Whether that is an appropriate price was an immediate subject of debate in financial circles.\n\nFollowing are view of analysts, fund managers, and academics on whether Microsoft is offering too much for Yahoo -- or might end up raising its bid.\n\n\u201cI think Microsoft is paying too much. This company is not worth more than $20 per share and the reason I say that is... there are only two or three properties that Yahoo has that are worthwhile. The only two properties or three properties of Yahoo that are good are Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Answers and the third one is Yahoo Finance.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, the premium seems exorbitant, for what is a dwindling business. I personally don\u2019t see how the synergies of Microsoft-Yahoo is going to take on Google.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe $31 per share offer by Microsoft for Yahoo, for a total valuation of $44.6 billion, seems like a substantial overpayment. At a trailing PE ratio of over 40, Yahoo was already fairly high-priced. Microsoft\u2019s offer values Yahoo at 68 times its current year\u2019s earnings, and nearly 60 times its forecasted earnings for next year, both rather high by any stretch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised to see this bid have to be raised over time. I think there are companies out there like Comcast and Viacom and others that still need to address the emergence of online media and haven\u2018t. So there are clearly other strategic companies out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere could be a little more money on the table. The company is in play. Yahoo will not be able to stay independent. Other bidders will emerge before this is over. Not Google -- they can\u2019t even get DoubleClick closed; they won\u2019t get Yahoo closed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect a deal to happen, perhaps at a slight premium to the current offer, given Yahoo\u2019s weakened market position and Microsoft\u2019s obvious need to become more relevant in the consumer Internet services/online advertising arenas.\u201d"
