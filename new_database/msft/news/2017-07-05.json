        "body": "HERAT, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Two Afghan girls refused visas to the United States for a robot-building competition said on Tuesday they were mystified by the decision, as the contest\u2019s organizers said teams from Iran and Sudan as well as a de facto Syrian team had gained visas.\n\nThe unusual story of the Afghan all-girl team of robotics students emerged as the United States grapples with the legality of President Donald Trump\u2019s order to temporarily ban travel from six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nAfghanistan itself is not on the list and Team Afghanistan\u2019s robot, unlike its creators, has been allowed entry to the United States. Asked by Reuters on Tuesday why the girls were banned, a U.S. State Department spokesperson cited regulations prohibiting the agency from discussing individual visa cases.\n\nSo the six team members will watch the ball-sorting machine compete in Washington D.C. via video link during the July 16-18 event from their hometown of Herat, in western Afghanistan, according to the FIRST Global contest organizers.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know the reason why we were not granted visas, because other countries participating in the competition have been given visas,\u201d said 14-year-old Fatemah Qaderyan, part of the team that made two journeys to the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul to apply for their papers.\n\n\u201cNo one knows about the future but ... we did our best and we hope that our robot could get a position along other robots from other countries,\u201d Qaderyan said.\n\nMost of the female team members were either infants or not yet born at the time of the U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 that toppled the Taliban regime \u2013 whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned girls from school, women from working outside the home and all females from leaving home without a male relative.\n\nMore than 15 years later, around 10,000 U.S. and allied international troops remain in Afghanistan to support an elected government in Kabul that constitutionally guarantees women\u2019s rights but is increasingly losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory.\n\nQaderyan\u2019s teammate from Herat, 17-year-old Lida Azizi, was less forgiving of the U.S. visa decision. \u201cAll of the countries can participate in the competitions, but we can\u2018t. So it\u2019s a clear insult for the people of Afghanistan,\u201d Azizi said.\n\nFIRST Global\u2019s president, Joe Sestak, said in a post on the organization\u2019s Facebook page that he was \u201csaddened\u201d by the U.S. decision but the Afghan team would be able to connect with the competition via a live Skype video link.\n\n\u201cThat is how we must now honor our fellow teammates, those brave girls from Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the teams of 156 countries \u2013 including from Iran and Sudan, which are on Trump\u2019s list of countries whose citizens are banned from entry \u2013 had received their visas.\n\n\u201cThe support of the U.S. State Department (including its embassies) has been simply nothing short of amazing,\u201d Sestak said in the post, adding that one other team, from Gambia, had been also denied visas.\n\nAlso approved for visas was \u201cTeam Hope,\u201d a group of Syrian refugees, he said.\n\nSyria is among the Muslim-majority countries named in Trump\u2019s executive order prohibiting all citizens from entry for 90 days. The other countries, apart from Iran, Syria and Sudan, are Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nIn a June 26 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revived parts of Trump\u2019s March 6 executive order that had been blocked by lower courts. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a U.S. person or entity."
