        "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as demand for its cloud computing services for companies rose and its personal computer software business stabilized.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s largest software company rose 3.1 percent to $81.20 in trading after the bell.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s focus on fast-growing cloud applications and platforms is helping it beat slowing demand for personal computers that has hurt sales of Windows - the software that powered the company to the top in the 1990s.\n\nUnder Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business - which includes products such as Office 365, Dynamic 365 and the flagship Azure computing platform - has emerged as a major source of growth.\n\nRevenue from Microsoft\u2019s intelligent cloud business rose nearly 14 percent to $6.92 billion in Microsoft\u2019s fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had expected $6.70 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.\n\nRevenue from Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and offerings from Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, IBM (IBM.N) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), grew 90 percent compared to a 97 percent growth rate in the preceding quarter.\n\nAzure\u2019s strong performance helped lift the gross margin at Microsoft\u2019s cloud business to 57 percent, said Stephanie Rodriguez, director of investor relations for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft said its commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate reached $20.4 billion in the quarter. In 2015, Nadella set a target of $20 billion in cloud revenue by 2018.\n\nIn a call with analysts after earnings, Nadella said retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) recently chose Azure its hybrid cloud platform.\n\nRevenue from Microsoft\u2019s personal computing division, its largest by revenue, fell 0.2 percent to $9.38 billion but handily beat analysts\u2019 estimate of $8.81 billion.\n\nAfter two straight quarters of declining Surface revenue, Microsoft notched a 12 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its tablets and laptops in the latest quarter, helped by the release of a new Surface in May.\n\nMicrosoft also benefited from a 13 percent year-over-year increase in revenue from Dynamics, its enterprise and sales software business which competes with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).\n\n\u201cEven though best in class is Salesforce, Microsoft has a good enough product to get a large amount of business,\u201d said Kim Forrest, an equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is set for an acceleration of growth and bookings with margin concerns that were overblown heading into 2018,\u201d said Daniel Ives at research firm GBH Insights. \u201cA slowly improving PC environment is also a modest tailwind for Microsoft with cloud remaining the Trojan horse growth driver for Redmond over the coming years.\u201d\n\nThe technology company, based in Redmond, Washington, reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 84 cents per share, up from $5.67 billion, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2lkGlyz)\n\nMicrosoft's shares had risen nearly 27 percent this year through Thursday, eclipsing the 14.4 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 .SPX."
