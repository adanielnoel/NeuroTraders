        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft on Thursday reported strong fourth-quarter earnings on the back of its fast-growing cloud computing business, stoking optimism that the once-stagnant company has found a new groove.\n\nThe results were the clearest sign yet that the strategy put in place by Chief Executive Satya Nadella when he assumed the top job in 2014 is paying off. He has shifted the company\u2019s focus away from a dying personal computer software business and reinventing it as a provider of cloud computing and subscription-based software.\n\n\u201cOur technology world view of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge is resonating with customers everywhere,\u201d Nadella said on the company\u2019s earnings conference call with investors on Thursday afternoon.\n\nMost notably, revenue from the cloud unit, which includes the flagship Azure platform and server products, rose about 11 percent to $7.43 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $7.32 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet. Revenue from Azure, which competes directly with Amazon.com's market-leading AWS division, nearly doubled in the quarter. (bit.ly/2oQAzSJ)\n\nHighlighting Azure\u2019s growth were notable increases to Microsoft\u2019s long-term unearned revenue, which rose by more than 61 percent year-over-year. The metric is used to indicate long-term commitments for services and products, said Kim Forrest, vice president and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, a portfolio management firm.\n\nIn a bid to continue this momentum, Microsoft last week launched Azure Stack, a new service that allows customers to run a local version of the company\u2019s cloud technology.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a one-quarter wonder,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cAmazon is going to be paying attention to this.\u201d\n\nMichael Turits, analyst at Raymond James & Associates, noted that Azure is smaller than Amazon\u2019s service but that it is growing faster. \u201cI think it is appealing well to existing enterprise customers who might not immediately be drawn to the Amazon platform,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft\u2019s various businesses mostly performed well.\n\nThe commercial offering of Office 365 was up 43 percent while Dynamics 365, Microsoft\u2019s customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning service, saw a year-over-year increase of 74 percent.\n\nRevenue dropped 2 percent in the personal computer division, which includes Windows 10 and Microsoft\u2019s line of Surface hardware. The company said it recorded $306 million in restructuring charges following a reorganization of its sales and marketing teams that was announced earlier this month. The restructuring resulted in layoffs for thousands of Microsoft employees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the layoffs are a worry at all,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. \u201cThey\u2019re just part of the ongoing transition Microsoft is going through as cloud grows and its legacy business shrinks.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s net income more than doubled to $6.51 billion or 83 cents per share in the quarter, from $3.12 billion or 39 cents per share in the year-earlier period.\n\nExcluding one-time items, Microsoft earned 98 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, revenue rose 9.1 percent to $24.7 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 71 cents per share and revenue of $24.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
