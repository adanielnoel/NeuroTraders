Ballmer, outgoing and involved in many social clubs on campus, seemed to be a study in contrast to the aloof Gates, who preferred all-night programming sessions and poker games.\n\nHowever, the pair shared a love of math and bonded over their reputations as energetic guys.

The two sites received snapshots of Kmart and Radio Shack flyers advertising the $299 price.\n\nA Microsoft spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.\n\nMicrosoft last cut the price of the Xbox Pro in August, from $399 to $349, prior to the release of \u201cHalo 3\u201d the following month.\n\nA cut to $299 would make the Xbox 360 Pro $100 less than one of the console\u2019s major rivals, Sony Corp\u2019s (6758.T) PlayStation 3 with a 40 gigabyte hard drive.\n\nMicrosoft is locked in a three-way competition with Nintendo\u2019s 7974.OS Wii and the PlayStation 3, which comes with a high-definition Blu-ray video player."

        "body": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc on Monday sought to rally shareholder support in the face of a proxy battle with billionaire Carl Icahn, saying the activist investor had an \u201cill-defined plan\u201d for the future of the Internet company.\n\nYahoo detailed its rationale for rejecting a $47.5 billion takeover offer by Microsoft Corp, questioning whether the software maker was ever serious about a full-scale merger in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cThe record casts doubt on whether Microsoft was ever committed to a whole-company transaction,\u201d the filing states.\n\nMicrosoft spokeswoman Jamie Moser fired back at Yahoo\u2019s allegations that the software giant was not earnest in pursuing the deal: \u201cThis is simply revisionist history,\u201d she said.\n\nIcahn is running a slate of directors to replace Yahoo\u2019s board and has called for the removal of Chief Executive Jerry Yang ahead of the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting to be held in Silicon Valley on August 1.\n\nThe activist shareholder has said the company should still offer to sell itself, though Microsoft has said it is no longer interested in a full buyout.\n\n\u201cIcahn misrepresents the manner in which we negotiated with Microsoft,\u201d Yahoo said in an investor presentation it plans to make at the meeting. \u201cOur board remains the best and most qualified group to maximize value for Yahoo stockholders.\u201d\n\nThe company struck a similar tone in a letter to shareholders last week.\n\nSeveral major Yahoo investors said on Friday they are not sure whether they will side with Icahn in his proxy fight, including Legg Mason Capital Management, its third-largest institutional shareholder.\n\nEarlier this month, Yahoo rejected an alternate Microsoft proposal to buy its search business and a 16 percent stake in the company for $9 billion, plus annual advertising payments.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft proposed (a) last-minute \u2018hybrid\u2019 search-only structure, which does not benefit Yahoo financially or strategically and is based on flawed assumptions,\u201d Yahoo revealed in its filing on Monday.\n\nInstead Yahoo reached a nonexclusive pact with larger rival Google Inc on search advertising. Yahoo says that deal will add as much as $450 million in operating cash flow within the first year and allow it to build other money-generating partnerships as well.\n\nYoussef Squali, an analyst with brokerage Jefferies & Co, sided with Yahoo in many of its arguments, but said the most likely outcome at the annual meeting was that investors would elect some of Icahn\u2019s board nominees to pressure the company.\n\n\u201cWe believe that shareholders may want to confer a handful of board seats to Icahn\u2019s slate in order to maintain the sense of urgency and accountability to the current board,\u201d he said.\n\nYahoo shares fell 2.9 percent to $20.72. The stock is down sharply since Microsoft withdrew its offer to buy Yahoo or to strike a partial deal to invest in it and buy its Web search arm. It now trades less than $2 above the $19.18 level where it stood before Microsoft\u2019s original bid.\n\nThe stock has fallen from a high near $30 in February -- when expectations were high that Yahoo would eventually accept Microsoft\u2019s January 31 offer of $31 per share in cash and stock. Microsoft withdrew its offer to buy the company in early May."
