        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are due to announce a deeper partnership involving GE\u2019s Predix industrial internet platform and Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, a senior GE executive said.\n\nThe agreement broadly expands integration of Microsoft\u2019s cloud software with GE\u2019s Predix applications, Bill Ruh, Chief Executive of GE Digital, told Reuters late on Tuesday.\n\nPredix is a software platform developed by GE that connects industrial equipment like jet engines and power plants to computers that can predict failures and reduce operating costs.\n\nThe partnership, due to be announced on Wednesday by GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery and Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, comes days after GE announced a partnership with Apple Inc (AAPL.O). It shows GE\u2019s ability to forge significant new deals with its industrial internet system after a rocky period with Predix.\n\nThe joint effort is focused initially on oil-and-gas and mining companies, but would also be applicable to other companies that run Microsoft software, which includes the vast majority of industrial companies, Ruh said. He declined to provide further details."
