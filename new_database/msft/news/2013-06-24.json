        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it would support Oracle Corp software on its cloud-based platforms, a tie-up aimed at improving the rivals\u2019 chances against nimbler Web-based computing companies chipping away at their traditional businesses.\n\nThe two industry leaders have competed for decades to sell technology to the world\u2019s largest companies. But they face growing pressure from new rivals selling often-cheaper services based in remote data centers, and they are rushing to adapt.\n\nThe two companies have long collaborated out of the public eye to meet customers\u2019 needs, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on a conference call. \u201cIn the world of cloud computing, I think behind-the-scenes collaboration is not enough.\u201d\n\nThe tie-up does not resolve major competitive challenges the two tech pioneers face in the cloud market, but their cooperation was seen as a symbolically important step.\n\n\u201cIs it a game changer today? Not at all. It shows both companies are serious about their cloud endeavors. The fact that historical competitors are now friends speaks to how big the cloud opportunity is. And it opens up potential avenues of growth down the road,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at investment bank FBR.\n\nUnder the agreement, customers will be able to run Oracle software on Microsoft\u2019s Server Hyper-V and on Windows Azure platforms, the companies said.\n\nMicrosoft will offer Oracle\u2019s Java, Database and WebLogic Server to Windows Azure customers, while Oracle will also make Linux available to Windows Azure customers, the companies said in a news release.\n\nIronically, the pact means Microsoft is effectively promoting Linux and Java-based software, longtime rivals to its own Windows platform. But the software maker stands to benefit from getting any customer to pay for its datacenter services, regardless of the underlying software being used.\n\nNo. 3 software maker Oracle last week missed expectations for software sales for the fourth quarter, sending its shares plunging. Investors worried that the company may have trouble competing with software providers like Salesforce.com and Workday, as well as Amazon.com, which has also become a major player in cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nTop software maker Microsoft\u2019s large-scale cloud computing initiative, called Azure, has failed to catch up with Amazon\u2019s cloud offering, called AWS (Amazon Web Services), which blazed the trail in elastic online computing services in the cloud.\n\nThe rivalry between Oracle and Microsoft dates back several decades and has been marked by a personal rivalry between the companies\u2019 best-known cofounders: Larry Ellison and Bill Gates.\n\nIn 1995, as the Windows franchise was taking off, Ellison began a high-profile but unsuccessful effort to promote a less expensive competitor to the personal computer known as the Network Computer. Gates began aggressively attacking Oracle\u2019s core database business in the late 1990s, infuriating Ellison as Microsoft\u2019s less-expensive SQL Server gained market share.\n\nIn recent years, both have come under attack from a wave of younger companies, like Workday and Salesforce, which charge a single subscription fee for software and support, at far lower margins than for Oracle\u2019s traditional products.\n\nEllison told analysts on last Thursday\u2019s quarterly conference call that Oracle had forged alliances with Microsoft and Salesforce.com, which uses Oracle\u2019s technology, and said he would announce details this week.\n\nOver the past five years, shares of Amazon.com, which rents remote computing and storage to other companies, have surged 237 percent. Salesforce.com, founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, has risen 105 percent.\n\nDuring the same half decade, Oracle\u2019s stock has risen 38 percent and Microsoft\u2019s shares are up 21 percent."
