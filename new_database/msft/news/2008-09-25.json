        "body": "WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) came under sharp criticism from a U.S. judge on Thursday for being slow to produce technical documents it is required to give software makers as part of a 2002 antitrust settlement.\n\nAt a hearing to discuss Microsoft\u2019s progress in complying with the settlement, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly scolded Microsoft for writing in a report that what it had already produced \u201cfully complies with the final judgments.\u201d\n\nShe disagreed, and insisted that the company work more quickly to produce the systems documents that software makers need to write applications for the Windows operating system.\n\n\u201cThe systems documents, as far as I\u2018m concerned, are required,\u201d Kollar-Kotelly told the Microsoft team, adding that she wanted to see court oversight of Microsoft ended on schedule on Nov. 12, 2009. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen unless these things get done.\u201d\n\nThe issue was part of discussions at a hearing held to review Microsoft\u2019s compliance with the pact that settled findings the company had abused its dominance in personal computer operating systems.\n\nMicrosoft was required to issue licenses for companies who want to write programs for the Windows computer operating system, and provide technical information about Windows to help make the programs work.\n\nThe next hearing is set for Jan. 28.

And yet as I travel...given the current circumstances, people still see a certain buoyancy in the market,\u201d Ballmer told a meeting of Silicon Valley civic leaders.\n\n\u201cAt least, for now, people are feeling, I won\u2019t say optimistic, but better than you would be feeling if you are watching CNBC all day,\u201d he said of the financial TV channel.\n\nBallmer, the leader of the world\u2019s largest software maker, said he was speaking generally of industry demand rather than his own business. \u201cWe are one week from the end of the quarter, so I have nothing all that interesting to say,\u201d he joked.\n\nWall Street analysts, on average, expect the Redmond, Washington-based company to generate an 8 percent rise in revenue to just under $15 billion during its fiscal first quarter ending in September.
