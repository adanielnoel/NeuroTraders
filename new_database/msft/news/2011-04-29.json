        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Friday on strength from Caterpillar and other industrials, lifting the Dow and Nasdaq to their best monthly performance since December.\n\nHeavy machinery manufacturer Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) led the way after reporting a fivefold increase in profit and raising its full-year forecast.\n\n\u201cNow that earnings are coming in, the investment community is telling you that once some of these negative issues subside -- sovereign debt, Middle Eastern tensions -- this market is going to rip,\u201d said Jason Weisberg, managing director at Seaport Securities Corp.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow average climbed 4 percent for the month while the S&P 500 rose 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq gained 3.3 percent.\n\n\u201cYou take that entire mixture and the market took all of that simultaneously -- they weren\u2019t separate events -- they were all concurrent. And we couldn\u2019t blast the market below 12,000,\u201d Weisberg said.\n\nConcerns that the market would pull back after earnings are somewhat offset by favorable corporate outlooks and expectations for continued easy money policies from the Federal Reserve that have fueled runs in speculative assets.\n\nApril\u2019s gains were limited by slides in Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the Nasdaq\u2019s most heavily traded stock, and BlackBerry maker Research in Motion RIM.TORIMM.O.\n\nCaterpillar gave the top boost to the Dow, advancing 2.5 percent to $115.41, after reaching an all-time high of $116.25 during the session. The S&P industrial sector index .GSPI added 0.3 percent. Caterpillar is up more than 20 percent so far this year, along with fellow industrial Boeing Co (BA.N).\n\nMicrosoft dropped 3 percent to $25.92 and was the biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow after it reported a drop in quarterly sales of its Windows software, mirroring a recent downturn in demand for personal computers. U.S.-listed shares of Research in Motion tumbled 14 percent to $48.65 after the BlackBerry maker cut its first-quarter forecasts.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 47.23 points, or 0.37 percent, to 12,810.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 3.13 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,363.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC edged up 1.01 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,873.54.\n\nFor the week, the Dow rose 2.4 percent, the S&P 500 gained 2 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.9 percent.\n\nMerck & Co Inc (MRK.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings, fueled by strong sales of drugs for diabetes, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, while Chevron Corp (CVX.N) reported a jump in earnings as oil prices surged.\n\nShares of Merck rose 0.45 percent to $35.95 while Chevron added 0.6 percent to $109.44. Both stocks are Dow components.\n\nRobust corporate earnings, ample liquidity from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of ultra-low interest rates for the rest of the year have sparked bullishness, pushing the Nasdaq to a 10-year high and lifting the S&P 500 more than 8 percent this year. The major U.S. stock indexes also hit new yearly highs during the week.\n\nThe rebalancing by Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ.O) of its benchmark Nasdaq 100 index .NDX will take place on May 2, in which the exchange said it will cut the weight of 82 securities to bring them more in line with their market capitalizations. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will see its weighting dropped to 12.3 percent from 20.3 percent.\n\nWith May, the market is heading into a typically weak period. May has been the fourth-weakest month for the Dow, averaging a 0.2 percent gain since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. It also normally marks the start of the worst six months of the year for the industrials.\n\nVolume was light, with about 7.17 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 7.72 billion.\n\nAdvancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,953 to 1,028, while on the Nasdaq, advancers beat decliners 1,417 to 1,146."

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Research in Motion cut its quarterly earnings and revenue forecasts, expecting to ship fewer BlackBerry smartphones.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Microsoft Corp reported a dip in quarterly sales of its core Windows operating system, mirroring a recent downturn in personal computers and sending its shares down slightly.\n\n\u201dOperators are bringing inventory levels even further down ahead of new products. Emerging market operators might have had even higher inventory levels.\n\n\u201dTheir exposure to higher-end Android and of course Apple in mature markets has been fairly well documented. I think they\u2019ve surprised the street for the past couple quarters with very good execution in emerging markets and their ability to extract margin from lower ASP devices. That\u2019s a testament to their effective product-mix management and new market execution.\n\n\u201dBut it doesn\u2019t fix their lack of hero devices in their core markets.\n\n\u201dI\u2018m sure RIM understands that there are serious gaps in their portfolio, and I\u2018m sure that the transition to QNX -- the OS that runs the new PlayBook tablet -- is one in a series of measures put in place to address this. But it\u2019s likely that this warning is a direct reflection of the cost of transitioning platforms.\n\n\u201cAt some level if you miss a few product cycles, you have to expect to take some lumps before you can mount a comeback. Those new products and perhaps a revitalized set of services can\u2019t come soon enough. We\u2019ll see what they have to say at BlackBerry World, their annual conference next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re guiding down and feeling the heat from Apple and the Android with Google. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis is the beginning of the slide. The competition on the smartphone side of the business is getting very intense and they\u2019ve not been able to field a decent smartphone, so they\u2019re going to start losing ground here.\n\n\u201dIncreasingly, RIM is being relegated to the low-end, quasi-smartphone. Without a flagship touchscreen, high-end smartphone, they are going to continue to lose traction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like air coming out of a balloon slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis is the best they can do in the industry they have. The quarter was almost in line.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to get excited about. But 2012 is going to be much weaker versus 2011. It\u2019s all about innovation and the pace of innovation. The question to ask is: is there any product line in Microsoft that they are not playing catch up on?\u201d\n\n\u201dThe stock is clearly a value play. They executed quite well.\n\n\u201dThe concern is PC markets are being disrupted. There\u2019s some validity. But it\u2019s also overblown when you factor in that Windows 7 is the fastest-selling OS in history.\n\n\u201dThere was $4.5 billion in (Windows) revenue. They missed by $100 million. Windows 7 is the fastest selling OS in history -- you\u2019ve got to put it in perspective. Tablets are not going to replace PCs. Ok, they are definitely eating into laptops in some markets. But Microsoft will be in that game.\n\n\u201dYou\u2019re going to see Windows 8 come in September, that\u2019s going to help offset the tablet concerns, because it\u2019s going to run tablets.\n\n\u201dDecember quarter set a record for PC shipments. They\u2019ve been weaker in this quarter. But an all-time record was set just 90 days ago. Everyone\u2019s seen the IDC data. Intel came out and said PC shipments are going to be low single-digits. PCs are a mature market now.\n\n\u201cSo the stock is off a little bit after hours, but it\u2019s been climbing up last couple of days. Most importantly, they gave really good op-ex guidance for next year. I was worried a little bit that the Nokia expenses they took out would creep up expenses.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe highlight would be continued strength in enterprise, which we are seeing in Microsoft and which we saw in Intel and some of the other companies.\n\n\u201cThe company continues to execute very well and doesn\u2019t seem to get credit for it within its valuation.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s hard to get excited about the Microsoft story when there are more exciting growth opportunities in the marketplace.\n\n\u201dWith that said, Microsoft to me is no longer a growth stock but it is a very attractive value stock. They continue to generate tremendous free cash flow. Their balance sheet is really unmatched.\n\n\u201cWhat you will begin to see is a shift away from growth investors, you are seeing that transition where Microsoft is in no man\u2019s land, but I think they will become increasingly more attractive to value investors.\u201d"

Twenty-five of 35 analysts polled by StarMine recommend buying the stock. Only one says sell.\n\nAs a result of Microsoft\u2019s decline, it is close to being eclipsed by old foe IBM in terms of market value. Apple, which overtook Microsoft last year, is the most valuable U.S. tech company at $321 billion, Microsoft is second at $225 billion and IBM is third at $207 billion."
