        "body": "(Reuters) - Sales of Microsoft Corp\u2019s Surface tablets and Xbox gaming consoles are soaring.\n\nBut they contribute less than a 10th of the company\u2019s revenue and, analysts say, they\u2019re probably barely profitable - if they are profitable at all.\n\nSo are the businesses worth it? Not unless they start to generate significant profits soon, some analysts say.\n\n\u201cUnless Microsoft can get to hardware break-even within two years or demonstrate sufficient offsetting value elsewhere in the portfolio, we think the company should exit the hardware business,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a client note.\n\nExiting hardware could add up to $4 per share to Microsoft\u2019s market value, they said.\n\nMicrosoft, which is shuttering its Nokia phone business, said on Tuesday it would pump the ensuing savings into its fast-growing cloud business, Windows 10 and its hardware division, which includes tablets, Xbox and smartphones.\n\nAnalysts agree that investing in cloud and Windows 10 makes strategic sense, but some say the rationale behind pouring more money into hardware is less clear.\n\n\u201cHardware remains a more commoditized piece across tech,\u201d said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives, who thinks all of Microsoft\u2019s resources should be going into software.\n\n\u201cHardware is not what got Microsoft here - software did.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s shares fell as much as 4 percent on Wednesday, a day after the company reported a record quarterly loss due to the $7.5 billion writedown of its Nokia phone business.\n\nEven so, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said he remained committed to making phones to attract Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t break out operating margins for its hardware business, but Jefferies & Co analyst John DiFucci told Reuters he believed the Xbox business was at best break-even and that Surface was unprofitable on an operating basis.\n\n\u201cWe believe redeploying funds into ... hardware is a mistake given that business\u2019s lack of margin and strategic importance to Microsoft,\u201d he said.\n\nIncluding the impact of a strong dollar, revenue from Microsoft\u2019s computing and gaming hardware business rose 44 percent in the fourth quarter ended June 30 - half the increase achieved in the company\u2019s cloud business.\n\nStill, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler said he didn\u2019t expect Microsoft to drop either Surface or Xbox.\n\n\u201cInvestors will be fine with both if they are break-even or going to be there shortly,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nMoerdler said Microsoft likely would increasingly make gaming available on Windows as a way to attract users to Windows devices."
