        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s quarterly profit fell slightly as the world\u2019s largest software maker was hit by slower-than expected growth in computer sales.\n\nAmazon.com posted a quarterly revenue and operating income forecast that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates. Its shares fell almost 10 percent. [ID:nN27148561]\n\n\u201dAmazon is a disciplined company, they\u2019re long-term focused. The spending that they\u2019re doing reflects the strength of their growth.\n\n\u201dTopline still seems to be really strong, but to meet this demand they\u2019re having to invest in fulfillment and distribution and that\u2019s taking a little bit of a short-term margin toll.\n\n\u201dYes, Amazon\u2019s pulling back based on this, but this doesn\u2019t affect the long-term story at all. If you believe in the story and can see the upside that they have, they\u2019re doing the right things to meet that demand.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the size of the opportunity, and how relatively under-penetrated e-commerce still is, and the opportunity ahead of Amazon to basically gain share, they\u2019re making the right decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon discussed on its prior two calls its need to invest in its fulfillment and distribution and this is consistent with that. But I think people were expecting kind of a blowout when they looked at data points that suggested that e-commerce spending potentially had the strongest quarter in three years.\u201d\n\n\u201dOperating income (guidance) for the first quarter is well below the consensus and the stock is taking a big hit. It could be that they\u2019re back to spending mode.\n\n\u201dExpectations were high here, and the stock ran up today.\n\n\u201cThe slight miss on revenue for the fourth quarter is noise. They\u2019re going to have to explain what the operating income (forecast) miss is. That\u2019s a decline from the first quarter of last year and well below expectations. I\u2018m very curious what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nHe said operating income expectations had been for around $274 million.\n\n\u201dLooks like it was disappointing on the top line number. Operating margins improved slightly but not as much I was expecting. Seems like it was a competitive holiday season.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of expectations the revenue number would be $13 billion and that just didn\u2019t happen. And going forward, it\u2019s going to be the revenue number and sustainable operating margins that what will dictate the share price.\u201d\n\n\u201dI really think that Kinect represents the most legitimate opportunity we have seen for the Xbox to drive some profit. I do think there is a meaningful catalyst there.\n\n\u201dWhen I looked at Steve Ballmer at CES, none of it was terribly groundbreaking. It was the opposite of an Apple event.\n\n\u201dBut the Windows phone looks good. I do think that Windows phone 7 is proving to be an interesting alternative to the Blackberry.\n\n\u201cI guess the nut of it is, Microsoft is starting to do something better and they are not tripping on themselves and that counts for something.\u201d\n\n\u201dOutstanding numbers when you take a first look at it but when you delve into them, Windows missed expectations by $300 million.\n\n\u201cThe big surprise is huge strength in the Office business, $600 million above expectations. That is really being driven by the Office 10 release.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis company has got some momentum behind it. The core businesses have been setting records. They\u2019ve got a nice, tight focus on their core marketplaces. They\u2019ve got discipline in terms of cost controls and driving earnings. They\u2019re the best in the space in terms of returning cash to shareholders.\n\n\u201cBasically, we\u2019ve gotten over 300 million Windows 7 licenses sold. I mean, PCs are not disappearing. Put that into perspective with 7 million tablets sold last quarter from Apple. Clearly there are disruptions in the landscape, but some of the negative viewpoints are overblown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems like there is strength across the board. I think it\u2019s fair to say the Windows division numbers were light. The weakness in the consumer PC market has been widely known.\u201d"

The unit, which is making only slight headway against Google Inc (GOOG.O), has lost more than $6 billion in the last five years.\n\nUnearned revenue -- a measure of the strength of the business in Microsoft\u2019s pipeline -- fell 9.5 percent to $13.4 billion, a cause of concern to some investors.\n\nMicrosoft reported overall fiscal second-quarter profit of $6.63 billion, or 77 cents per share, compared with $6.66 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.

        "body": "Microsoft isn\u2019t all about Windows: Some serious growth in its entertainment and business divisions helped spur Microsoft to a strong finish in the second quarter of its 2011 fiscal year, with revenue up 5 percent.\n\nThe earnings were released \u2014 or rather, leaked \u2014 on Microsoft\u2019s own website, slightly ahead of schedule in a rather odd snafu for Microsoft. Investors were nonetheless pleased with the results, sending Microsoft\u2019s shares up about 1.4 percent in regular trading. Shares were up further by about 0.5 percent to $28.90 in extended trading.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue was for the second quarter of its 2011 fiscal year $20 billion, from $19 billion in the second quarter of its 2010 fiscal year. Its income off that revenue was down 4 percent to around $8.2 billion from $8.5 billion in the second quarter in its 2010 fiscal year. But that beat the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, which was around $19.14 billion.\n\nThe largest spike in growth are in Microsoft\u2019s entertainment and business divisions. The entertainment division, which includes the Xbox 360, grew 55 percent and brought in $3.7 billion. A big chunk of that came from sales of Microsoft\u2019s newest motion controller for the XBox 360, the Kinect, that lets players control games with their entire bodies. Income off its entertainment division almost doubled, growing from $370 million in the second quarter in 2009 to $680 million in 2010.\n\nMicrosoft sold 6.3 million XBox 360 consoles during the holiday season, and 8 millon Kinect controllers in the first 60 days after launch. Memberships of its premium XBox Live online service grew 30 percent in the second quarter of its 2011 fiscal year, according to the company. Microsoft is expecting 50 percent growth in its entertainment division in the third quarter, and 40 percent overall for its 2011 fiscal year.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s business division brought in $6 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up from $4.8 billion the same quarter a year earlier. Sales of its Windows services were down, with revenue dropping around 30 percent to $5 billion in the second quarter of 2010 from $7.1 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Online advertising revenue from its search site, Bing, grew 23 percent.\n\nWindows 7 sales were responsible for bringing about record-breaking quarters for Microsoft in 2009, but have since faded a bit as many have already upgraded to the newest operating system. Income from its business division was up around 33 percent to $4 billion in the second quarter of its 2011 fiscal year, from $3 billion in its second quarter of the 2010 fiscal year. Microsoft has sold 300 million copies of Windows 7 since launch, and around a fifth of all Internet-connected PCs are running Windows 7, according to the company.\n\nMost of the talk has been about whether Microsoft would bring in less quarterly income than Apple, which has since blown by the Windows developer in value on the stock market. While bringing in less revenue (Apple took in around $26.7 billion), Microsoft generated more income \u2014 Apple only made about $6 billion in its most recent quarter."

The last time Apple produced more profit in a year than Microsoft was 1990.\n\nLast week, Apple announced a record $6 billion quarterly profit on strong-selling iPhones and iPads over the holiday shopping season.\n\nAnalysts expect Microsoft to post profit of $5.93 billion for the same quarter. Two years ago, Microsoft\u2019s profit was almost double Apple\u2018s.\n\nIt could be a painful moment for Microsoft, which effectively saved Apple from extinction with a $150 million investment in 1997.\n\nIf Microsoft does not impress Wall Street this quarter, or show it has a realistic plan for growth, questions will be asked about the leadership of Steve Ballmer, now in his 12th year as chief executive.\n\nA string of high-level departures has raised concerns about his efforts to revitalize the company.
