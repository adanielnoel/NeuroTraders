        "body": "Want to run Windows 7 on the new Apple iPad? Citrix says it will soon be possible--at least virtually--using a new version of its Citrix Receiver software.\n\nPromised to be ready when the tablet computer ships in March, Citrix says the new software, based on the current iPhone version, is a response to questions about how the iPad might find a home in the enterprise.\n\n\u201cIf your company has XenDesktop or XenApp you will be happy to know you will be able to use your iPad for real work as well,\u201d wrote Citrix Vice President Chris Fleck in a company blog.\n\n\u201cIt turns out the 9.7 inch display on the iPad with a 1024x768 screen resolution works great for a full VDI XenDesktop. Windows applications run unmodified and securely in the data center, and even multiple applications at once.\u201d\n\nCitrix says the iPad\u2019s larger screen solves many of the challenges users\u2019 faced because of when using the iPhone with a virtualized Windows desktop. (Which sounds pretty painful, if you ask me).\n\n\u201cThe iPhone restrictions of screen size and small keyboards are overcome with the iPad. The iPad looks to be an ideal end-point device that can empower users to be productive wherever they are and IT will be able to safely deliver company-hosted virtual desktops and apps without worry,\u201d Fleck wrote.\n\nWhile it might be interesting to add iPads to a company\u2019s enterprise environment, Fleck admits the new Receiver software might also be a way for customers to justify the purchase of tablets that employees will buy anyway.\n\n\u201cLet us know how you\u2019re going to put it to work,\u201d Fleck writes, concluding his post, \u201cEven it\u2019s just to rationalize buying another gadget.\u201d\n\nThe iPad isn\u2019t likely to be perfect for many business apps, besides presentations, but companies already supporting virtualized desktops many find applications and users that make sense for Apple\u2019s new tablet.\n\n(Here are my six reasons why you want an iPad, and six reasons you don\u2018t).\n\nDavid Coursey has been writing about technology products and companies for more than 25 years.

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted a bigger-than-expected 60 percent jump in quarterly profit, helped by strong sales of Windows 7, and said it expected business technology spending to recover this year.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest software maker said on Thursday that net profit came to $6.7 billion, or 74 cents per share, for its fiscal second quarter, versus $4.2 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year ago.\n\nAnalysts were expecting 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock rose 1 percent in after-hours trading, a relatively muted reaction that analysts attributed in part to a run-up in the stock following the launch of the Windows 7 operating system in October.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, these were very good results out of Microsoft. Expectations were heightened ever the last few weeks, given Q4 PC shipments and good numbers from Intel,\u201d said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones.\n\nOthers also pointed to confusion over the earnings numbers because Microsoft included the effects of deferred revenue from pre-sales of Windows 7 to PC makers and retailers, and its free upgrade program.\n\nExcluding that revenue, profit was 60 cents per share.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty clean, blowout beat,\u201d said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. \u201cAll the Street models should have reflected that deferred revenue because it\u2019s not a surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see enterprise spending growth in our fiscal second quarter just ended,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein told Reuters.\n\n\u201cHowever, our general view is a recovery will occur starting this calendar year and gradually over the next several years,\u201d he added.\n\nWindows 7 has proved to be Microsoft\u2019s strongest-selling operating system to date after the disappointing Vista. PC sales grew 15.2 percent last quarter.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue rose 14 percent to $19.02 billion, including $1.71 billion of deferred revenue from the Windows 7 launch in October. Excluding that, sales were $17.31 billion.\n\nMicrosoft shares rose to $29.42 in after-hours trading from their Nasdaq close of $29.16. At the close, The stock has risen 62 percent over the past 12 months, outstripping a 40 percent gain in the Nasdaq.\n\n\u201cLast year the stock was a big outperformer. A lot of people think the stock has already had its run,\u201d said Jane Snorek, technology analyst at First American Funds. \u201cBut I think with PCs doing this well and a new Office coming in June, that the stock can still outperform. I think Office can be a big hit.\u201d\n\nRivals International Business Machines Corp, Google Inc and Apple Inc have all beaten average Wall Street estimates this quarter, but saw their stocks fall or gain only slightly afterward."

        "body": "Thanks largely to the Windows 7 launch, Microsoft on Thursday reported a strong increase in net income and revenue for its second quarter of fiscal 2010.\n\nThe company rang up US$6.66 billion in net income, an increase of 60 percent from the same period a year earlier. Revenue totalled $19.02 billion for the quarter ending Dec. 31, a 14 percent increase from the prior year.\n\nPart of the boost came from deferred revenue earned earlier this year, from pre-sales of Windows 7 to PC makers and retailers. This revenue amounted to $1.71 billion.\n\nEven without the deferred revenue, the results were in line with analyst expectations, with second-quarter revenue totaling $17.31 billion, and earnings of $0.60 per share. In a poll of analysts, Thomson Reuters showed an expected revenue of $17.9 billion and earnings per share of $0.59.\n\nThis quarter saw the release of Windows 7, of which more than 60 million licenses were sold, the most Windows licenses ever sold in a single quarter, explained Bill Koefoed, Microsoft general manager of investor relations. The company also released Windows Server 2008 R2.\n\nWindows-related sales brought in the largest chunk of revenue, at $6.9 billion, up 72.5 percent from $4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Server and tools enjoyed a more modest increase, with $3.8 billion in revenue, up from $3.75 billion in the prior year.\n\nNot all of Microsoft\u2019s businesses sidestepped the recessionary doldrums, however. Online services revenue slumped in the quarter, to $581 million, down from $609 million the year before. The business division and the entertainment and services division also had lackluster revenue.\n\nThis was the last quarter overseen by Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell, who left Microsoft Dec. 31. Peter Klein has taken the CFO role.\n\n\u201cThese results were driven in large part by strong consumer demand for PCs,\u201d Klein said during a conference call to discuss the results. Business spending, he explained, has not picked up from the recessionary lull of the past year.\n\nMicrosoft estimated that the consumer PC market grew by more than 20 percent year over year, while business PC sales were flat, Koefoed said. Netbooks represented about 11 percent of the PC market, about the same as last quarter and last year.\n\nEventually, enterprise sales will pick up as businesses resume their hardware refresh cycles. \u201cAlthough the timing is uncertain, we\u2019ll be well-positioned to capitalize on the business pending recovery when it returns,\u201d Klein said.\n\nKlein pointed to the June release of Microsoft Office 2010 as a major income driver, and looking ahead, new offerings such as Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform Azure and the introduction of the next-generation Xbox control system, now code-named Natal."

But it\u2019s not clear yet what Microsoft will unveil.\n\nMany expect Microsoft to discuss Windows Mobile 7 -- the next major upgrade for Microsoft\u2019s mobile OS. But Microsoft has cast some doubt on that assertion in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Beta News posted an interview with Windows Phone Senior Marketing Manager Greg Sullivan discussing what Beta News believed to be a preview of WM7. However, Beta News later reported that Microsoft contacted the blog and said Sullivan\u2019s comments were not specifically about WM7. This led Beta News to believe Microsoft will not be discussing WM7 next month in Barcelona.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then Microsoft may be announcing a rumored Windows Mobile 6.6, which is said to be an incremental upgrade from Windows Mobile 6.5. Another popular prediction says Microsoft will announce its oft-rumored Zune Phone in Barcelona.\n\nWM7 is drawing a lot of speculation and interest because it should be the next major release from Microsoft in the face of the increasing popularity of competing Android and Apple iPhone handsets. Current rumors suggest there may be two versions of WM7 -- a business and a media edition -- and the new OS may include some kind of integration with Xbox LIVE.\n\nWindows Mobile 7 was expected to launch this year, but some rumors suggest the Mobile OS may be delayed until 2011. When asked to clarify whether Microsoft intends to announce Windows Mobile 7 next month in Barcelona, a Microsoft spokesperson said, \u201cWe\u2019re always working on future versions and have nothing new to announce.\u201d"
