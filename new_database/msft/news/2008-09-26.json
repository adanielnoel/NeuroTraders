And yet as I travel...given the current circumstances, people still see a certain buoyancy in the market,\u201d Ballmer told a meeting of Silicon Valley civic leaders.\n\n\u201cAt least, for now, people are feeling, I won\u2019t say optimistic, but better than you would be feeling if you are watching CNBC all day,\u201d he said of the financial TV channel.\n\nBallmer, the leader of the world\u2019s largest software maker, said he was speaking generally of industry demand rather than his own business. \u201cWe are one week from the end of the quarter, so I have nothing all that interesting to say,\u201d he joked.\n\nWall Street analysts, on average, expect the Redmond, Washington-based company to generate an 8 percent rise in revenue to just under $15 billion during its fiscal first quarter ending in September."
