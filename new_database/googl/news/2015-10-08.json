        "body": "(Reuters) - Google announced on Wednesday it is piloting a program called Accelerated Mobile Pages that allows users to search for news and pull up a host of articles from publishers instantly.\n\nBut unlike Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles, or Apple Inc\u2019s Apple News, publishers do not pay Google to have their articles show up.\n\n\u201cThis is a deal-less environment,\u201d Richard Gingras, head of news at Google, said at a media event announcing the program.\n\nGoogle, whose parent company is now Alphabet Inc, is currently piloting the program. Executives declined to say when it would be available for public use.\n\nPublishers have been struggling to get their Web-based content to load as seamlessly as it does inside their own apps. And adblockers, which allow users to block certain content, have made it increasingly important for news publishers to make their sites more user friendly and to ensure they do not have ads that take long to load or cause the content of the articles to reformat as the page loads.\n\nFor example, 60 percent of The Washington Post\u2019s audience comes through mobile devices, said Cory Haik, executive director of the publisher\u2019s emerging news products, speaking on a panel about the Google program.\n\nThe Post has spent the past 18 months improving its app for consumers, something that is \u201cwithin our control,\u201d Haik said. But he noted, \u201cthe Web is an entire different proposition...it is sort of the Wild West.\u201d\n\nTwitter Inc is one of the partners piloting Google\u2019s Accelerated Mobile Pages project and plans to link to it through its own app, Michael Ducker, product manager at Twitter, told the panel.\n\nThe New York Times, Vox.com, Buzzfeed and La Stampa are among other publishers participating in the pilot.\n\nWhile Accelerated Mobile Pages will not be immune to adblockers, Google and publishers say the new format will lend itself to a more consumer-friendly ad experience where ads load instantly.\n\nThe product will initially be available to news publishers but Google is open to offering it up to other types of content providers eventually, Gingras said.",

        "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli team competing in a race to the moon sponsored by Google has signed a with California-based SpaceX for a rocket launch, putting it at the front of the pack and on target for blast-off in late 2017, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nWith the deadline to win a $20 million first-place prize just two years off, pressure is mounting on the 16 rivals from around the world hoping to complete a privately funded moon landing.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s Moon Express announced a week ago that it had signed a contract with Lockheed Martin-backed Rocket Lab. But Israel\u2019s SpaceIL is the first team to have a launch agreement reviewed, verified and accepted by XPRIZE, the group overseeing the contest.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of this achievement cannot be overstated,\u201d said XPRIZE President Bob Weiss. \u201cThis is the official milestone that the race is on ... They\u2019ve lit the fuse, as it were, for their competitive effort.\u201d\n\nThe key hurdle was finding an affordable ride to outer space without government funding, said Eran Privman, CEO of SpaceIL.\n\nBecause his team\u2019s spacecraft is much smaller than most competitors - it looks like a robotic, four-legged table, about 1.5 meters tall and wide - the SpaceX Falcon 9 launcher can carry 20 small satellites whose fares will help cover costs, Privman said.\n\n\u201cOther teams are trying to find such solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nSpaceX is a private company owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n\nMuch work remains. SpaceIL must manufacture hardware to fit the rocket and only then can it be shipped to the United States, Privman said.\n\nThe mission is scheduled for late 2017, just before the contest deadline. Once exiting the rocket in space, the Israeli craft will make its journey to the moon.\n\nTo win, a privately funded team must place an unmanned spacecraft on the moon\u2019s surface that can explore 500 meters and transmit high-definition video and images back to earth.",
