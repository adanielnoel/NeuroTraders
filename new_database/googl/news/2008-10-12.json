Thank you,\u201d he said through a microphone, smiling.\n\nThe group cheered and laughed as Brin jokingly inquired whether Garriott would have access to the Internet on the ISS. As a good-luck gift, Brin gave him a camera memory card and wished him luck.\n\nOther visitors included Charles Simonyi, a Microsoft developer, who traveled to space in April 2007.\n\nBaikonur is a sleepy town in the barren steppes of central Kazakhstan.",
