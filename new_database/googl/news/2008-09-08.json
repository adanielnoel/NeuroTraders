        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Association of National Advertisers sent a letter objecting to the proposed Internet search advertising partnership between Yahoo Inc and Google Inc to government regulators reviewing the deal, the group said on Sunday.\n\nThe letter to Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnett, noted that \u201ca Google-Yahoo partnership will control 90 percent of search advertising inventory,\u201d the ANA, which represents major U.S. advertisers, said in a statement.\n\nThe partnership \u201cwill likely diminish competition, increase concentration of market power, limit choices currently available and potentially raise prices to advertisers for high quality, affordable search advertising,\u201d the statement said.\n\nBarnett could not be reached for comment on Sunday.\n\nYahoo \u201cremains steadfast in its belief that this deal -- in which prices are determined by advertiser demand-driven auctions, not by collaboration between Yahoo and Google -- will strengthen Yahoo\u2019s competitive position...and will help to drive a more robust, higher quality...marketplace for our advertisers,\u201d the company said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nGoogle spokesman Adam Kovacevich said \u201cnumerous advertisers have recognized that this agreement will help them better match their ads to users\u2019 interests, and that ad prices will continue to be set by competitive auction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile some have raised questions about the agreements\u2019 potential impact on ad prices, advertisers care far more about getting a good return on their advertising dollar than they do about buying cheap ads that don\u2019t bring in customers, and this agreement will clearly help advertisers reach Yahoo users more efficiently,\u201d Kovacevich said.\n\nYahoo struck the agreement in June with Google, the world\u2019s dominant supplier of Web search services, as it sought to shore up its advertising business and ward off pressure to merge from Microsoft.\n\nThe two companies said at the time that they were not required to get regulatory approval before implementing the deal, but had voluntarily delayed it for up to three-and-a-half months while anti-trust regulators review the arrangement.\n\nThe non-exclusive deal covers the United States and Canada but not other markets.\n\nUnder the deal, Google would supply Yahoo with advertising services to run alongside Yahoo\u2019s own Web search system. Yahoo runs the Web\u2019s second most popular search service.\n\nGoogle and Yahoo executives have defended the agreement, saying they will compete aggressively in other areas.\n\nGoogle could not be immediately reached for comment. Google has said it expects to carry out the Yahoo deal next month.\n\nSeveral states attorneys general also are reviewing the proposed pact, including Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, whose spokeswoman had no comment on the ANA\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to determine when (the Florida review) will be complete,\u201d McCollum\u2019s spokeswoman Sandi Copes said.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc has stepped up efforts to digitize dozens of historical newspapers and make scanned images of the original papers available online, the Internet search leader said on Monday.\n\nIn a blog post on the Silicon Valley-based company\u2019s website, Google said it is looking to make old newspapers searchable online by partnering with newspaper publishers to digitize millions of pages of news archives.\n\nThe effort involves the archives of dozens of newspaper titles and expands on a two-year-old effort by Google to work with two major U.S. newspapers -- The New York Times and Washington Post -- to index old papers in Google News Archive.\n\n\u201cNot only will you be able to search these newspapers, you\u2019ll also be able to browse through them exactly as they were printed -- photographs, headlines, articles, advertisements and all,\u201d Google product manager Punit Soni said in the blog post.\n\nThe new papers range from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \u201cthe first newspaper West of the Alleghenies\u201d (the Allegheny Mountains), to the Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph, which has continuously published for 244 years, making it North America\u2019s oldest lasting paper.\n\nThe additional newspapers allow readers to see how newspapers of bygone days covered historical events.\n\nAs an example, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's coverage of Neil Armstrong's (and Edwin Aldrin's) 1969 moon walk can be found at tinyurl.com/man-on-the-moon/.\n\nThe initial newspaper partners for the digital archiving program are located in the United States and Canada, a spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThe goal is no different than Google Book Search,\u201d company spokesman Gabriel Stricker said, referring to Google\u2019s broad-based effort to work with major academic libraries around the world to scan older, out-of-print books. \u201cIt is just getting a lot of published offline content online.\u201d",

The NBC-Google partnership extrapolates on the data supplied by Dish set-top boxes in millions of U.S. homes.\n\nNBC Universal and Google have also agreed to work together to adapt the Google TV Ad service for use in local TV markets.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O) shares tumbled 5.5 percent on Monday -- their sharpest dive since the company\u2019s weak quarterly report in July -- amid investor doubts over key advertising and phone partnerships.\n\nThe stock of the Internet search leader fell $24.30 to close at $419.95 after an advertising trade group objected to Google\u2019s planned ad partnership with Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, saying it would diminish competition in the Web search ad market.\n\nSanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said other factors included \u201cgenerally disappointing\u201d reviews that have emerged in anticipation of the expected launch of phones based on Google\u2019s mobile phone software, called Android.\n\n\u201cThere were some expectations that Android phones would be Google\u2019s big fourth-quarter news,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cInstead of fireworks, it may be a bit of a damp squib,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s decline was in sharp contrast to gains in the broad market. The Dow Jones Industrials index jumped 2.6 percent, or nearly 290 points, to close at 11,510.74 on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s weekend seizure of troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also led some traders to shift into beaten down financial sector stocks and out of technology as a defensive play, Lindsay said.\n\n\u201cThe decline could be partly trading related,\u201d he said. \u201cGoogle is not supported by any good news at the minute.\u201d\n\nIt was the worst trading day for Google shares since July 18, when shares tumbled 10 percent from $533 to close at $481. After recovering somewhat in early August, the stock has deteriorated steadily since the middle of last month.\n\nIn the options market, projected volatility on all of Google options has been steadily rising since the beginning of September, traders said.\n\n\u201cGoogle shares are likely to fluctuate more over the next 30 days than they have in the past,\u201d said Interactive Brokers Group equity options analyst Rebecca Engmann Darst. \u201cCall and put contracts are being priced higher to reflect that risk.\u201d\n\nTechnology stocks are weathering a \u201cgeneral undercurrent of concern\u201d at the moment and Google is not insulated, she said.\n\nLindsay nonetheless rates Google shares as \u201coutperform\u201d relative to the broader market. Paid search, Google\u2019s core revenue-generating business, \u201cis holding up extremely well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverybody was hoping for a big wow from Google. It looks less likely now,\u201d Lindsay said. However, he added: \u201cYou can never tell. It is all unsubstantiated rumor. As far as we can tell from the fundamentals there is no issue.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the Association of National Advertisers, which represents many of the nation\u2019s big advertisers, sent a letter to U.S. government regulators objecting to the proposed Web search advertising partnership between Yahoo and Google.\n\nThe partnership \u201cwill likely diminish competition, increase concentration of market power, limit choices currently available and potentially raise prices to advertisers for high quality, affordable search advertising,\u201d the ANA argued.\n\nYahoo struck its partnership agreement in June with Google, the world\u2019s dominant supplier of Web search services, as it sought to shore up its advertising business and ward off pressure to merge from Microsoft. Google and Yahoo reiterated their commitment to the deal in response to the ANA.\n\nThe nonexclusive deal covers the United States and Canada but not other markets.
