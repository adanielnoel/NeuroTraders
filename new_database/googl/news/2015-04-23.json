        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Google Inc on Wednesday launched a new U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low.\n\nThe service, Google\u2019s first entry into the wireless industry, will work only on the company\u2019s Nexus 6 phones and be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile\u2019s networks, Google said in a statement.\n\nThe service, called Project Fi, will automatically switch between the two networks and more than 1 million open, free Wi-Fi spots, depending on which signal is strongest.\n\nThe service will cost $20 a month plus $10 per gigabyte of data used. Customers will get money back for unused data.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google\u2019s senior vice president of products, said at a Barcelona conference last month the company was preparing to experiment with a mobile network, but that it did not intend to disrupt the wireless industry.\n\nThe service will be available on only one device and has limited carrier coverage, so it will not make Google a major wireless industry player, said Brian Blau, research director at Gartner.\n\nIf successful, however, Google\u2019s service could pressure wireless providers to further lower prices and better adapt to the rise of tablets and wearable devices, Blau added. Though some carriers, such as T-Mobile and AT&T Inc, allow unused data to roll over, most mobile plans require customers to pay for a set amount of data each month.\n\nBut Google first has to \u201ctest out features they think are going to differentiate themselves,\u201d Blau said, such as being able to transition from network connectivity to Wi-Fi.\n\nIf Google is able to provide those features, \u201cit\u2019s very possible they could become a major wireless player in the future,\u201d Blau said.\n\nPhone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet, Google said.\n\nThe company already has a strong presence in the mobile market through its Android operating system, which hosts some of the most popular apps, such as Gmail and Google Maps.",
