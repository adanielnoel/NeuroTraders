But the new rules don\u2019t just apply to U.S. companies, they apply to companies everywhere around the world, including in Europe, handling European data,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nAsked if Google and the others had anything to fear from Europe, he replied: \u201dNo, I don\u2019t think so. They will be able to do their business as they do today.\n\n\u201dBut if they retain data for longer than is necessary, or if they don\u2019t inform consumers about how their data is being used, they will be in violation of the rules.\n\n\u201cIf Google just tries to involve consumers in the process and doesn\u2019t hide its intentions or the extent to which personal data are involved, then it will be okay.\u201d\n\nAll the major technology companies have lobbied hard against the data protection regulation since it was unveiled in early 2012, concerned that the rules will damage their business model by imposing a costly burden on how they handle data, and their ability to target products and services at consumers.\n\nU.S. authorities are also worried that if Europe establishes a tough new data regime, the tendency will be for countries in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa to drift towards Europe\u2019s standards so as not to fall behind.\n\nThat would leave the United States either having to promise the same level of data protection or lobbying to get countries to lower their standards. An uneven regulatory playing field would make it harder for U.S. and other firms to compete.\n\nAlbrecht, one of the youngest members of the 766-seat parliament, said he felt partially responsible for representing a younger generation that has a different attitude towards their personal data and how it should be used or shared.\n\n\u201cWe have a different perspective on how we communicate and live together in a globalised digital environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to safeguard certain fundamental principles and rights because governments haven\u2019t been engaged on that.\u201d\n\nHe sees the United States, which has been the leading advocate of open access to data, a cultural norm that has in many respects helped fuel the growth of companies such as Google and Facebook, slowly changing its attitude.\n\n\u201cThere is a move in U.S. society as well about the protection of data and consumer self-determination in the market. We need to reassess the relationship between consumers and companies and the way citizens\u2019 data is used.\u201d",
