        "body": "Oct 14 (Reuters) - Barclays Capital lowered its price target on Google Inc (GOOG.O) and said it expects the company\u2019s growth trajectory to be hurt in the near-term mainly due to its high market share, broader macro slowdown and a strong dollar.\n\nThe brokerage, however, maintained its \u201coverweight\u201d rating on the stock citing Google as one among the two best franchises in the Internet space - the other being Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) - and said Google shares were undervalued at current levels.\n\nAnalyst Douglas Anmuth, who cut his price target on the stock to $542 from $600, lowered his fourth-quarter and 2009 earnings estimates for the company.\n\nAnmuth now expects the company\u2019s pro forma earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be $4.82, down from its prior view of $5.06. Revenue for the quarter was lowered by about 3 percent to $4.17 billion.\n\nThe analyst also lowered his 2009 revenue estimates by about 5 percent to $18.66 billion with earnings per share of $21.25.\n\nAnmuth said the company needed to provide a better insight into how it was managing expenses, given the circumstances of a more highly penetrated business model and potential foreign exchange headwinds.\n\nGoogle has also embarked on certain cost-cutting measures, including slow hiring, cuts in employee perks and scrapping of some projects that have less impact. But expenses on legal fees, professional service and bad debt have increased, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand the strategic benefits for Google of an independent Yahoo, we are not sure the search deal is worth the more intense scrutiny that will accompany it,\u201d Anmuth said on the impending deal between the two companies.\n\nGoogle shares were down 3 percent at $369.61 in morning trade Tuesday on Nasdaq.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Google is mounting another experiment in content distribution that might be even more ambitious than its recent launch of original animation from \u201cFamily Guy\u201d creator Seth MacFarlane.\n\nThe Internet giant quietly launched a video series September 8 on its YouTube property called \u201cPoptub\u201d with Embassy Row, the production company run by \u201cWho Wants to Be a Millionaire\u201d creator Michael Davies, and Pepsi.\n\nAs it did with MacFarlane\u2019s \u201cCartoon Cavalcade of Comedy,\u201d which became an instant hit on YouTube, Google plans to distribute \u201cPoptub\u201d on its Google Content Network (GCN), an ad network that provides the additional reach of hundreds of thousands of Web sites beyond YouTube.\n\nBut while \u201cCavalcade\u201d is simply a collection of 50 shortform episodes, \u201cPoptub\u201d is intended as an \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d for the YouTube set that will yield thousands of episodes, not to mention a more curated point of entry to YouTube, which it has been criticized for lacking.\n\n\u201cFor Seth, it\u2019s about launching episodes on a weekly basis,\u201d said Alexandra Levy, director of branded entertainment at Google. \u201cWith \u2018Poptub,\u2019 we\u2019re creating an organic destination on YouTube meant to live there for a longer period.\u201d\n\nBoth \u201cCavalcade\u201d and \u201cPoptub\u201d are employing Google\u2019s branded entertainment program, which allows content providers to bring in an advertiser to finance programing that gets distributed over what Google calls its \u201chub and spoke\u201d model. The hub is a channel on YouTube, and the spokes are in GCN, the countless selection of Web publishers that can be demographically targeted.\n\nGCN embeds the video on these Web pages in Google Gadgets, applications that allow viewers who sample an episode to link back to the \u201chub\u201d channel, where they can sample more programing and marketing messages from the sponsor.\n\nCombining GCN and YouTube provides a one-two punch for knocking out the primary concern advertisers have about funding content online: guaranteed reach. \u201cPoptub\u201d alone pledges to deliver 3 billion impressions by year\u2019s end.\n\nBeyond satisfying advertisers, Google\u2019s branded entertainment program could also entice more programmers to try online by offering monetizable distribution with the scale of TV or film while retaining ownership of intellectual property.\n\n\u201cIt allows a content creator like Seth MacFarlane to do what he does best and forgo the traditional network model, connect with an audience of similar size and turn a profit,\u201d said George Strompolos, manager of content partnerships at YouTube.\n\nThat said, Google is not about to load up on new content additions. Despite strong sampling for \u201cCavalcade,\u201d the company is being selective about admitting partners to the branded entertainment program. Earlier experiments with GCN, which previously delivered ads in strictly text or static images, did not do as well as \u201cCavalcade,\u201d including a 2006 trial with MTV Networks.\n\n\u201cPoptub\u201d is the follow-up to \u201cCavalcade\u201d but with a somewhat altered strategy. Rather than distributing on both YouTube and GCN at full blast as it did with \u201cCavalcade,\u201d \u201cPoptub\u201d deliberately was kept under the radar so that it could build a following on YouTube before broadening its exposure on GCN. While there\u2019s been a trickle of \u201cPoptub\u201d ads on GCN, Google and Embassy Row are waiting until there\u2019s more momentum on YouTube before going wider.\n\nAfter a month in operation, \u201cPoptub\u201d has more than 100 content segments produced, with several released each day. The programing mix ranges from cheeky interviews with YouTube-bred sensations such as Obama Girl and \u201cWhat the Buck\u201d host Michael Buckley to more conventional red-carpet coverage of Hollywood releases including \u201cNick and Norah\u2019s Infinite Playlist.\u201d There\u2019s also a weekly ratings report that ticks down the top draws on YouTube.\n\n\u201cPoptub\u201d is something of a reconstituted version of \u201cThe 9,\u201d a daily Web series Embassy Row produced that Yahoo hosted exclusively until cancelling it in April after a successful 18-month run. Leftovers from \u201c9\u201d include sponsor Pepsi and on-air host Maria Sansone, but \u201cPoptub\u201d differs from its predecessor in one crucial regard: Its coverage of pop culture is heavily weighted in favor of the home-grown personalities popular on YouTube rather than the typical Hollywood household names.\n\n\u201cIn our world, Michael Buckley is just as important as the stars of \u2018Entourage\u2019 because on YouTube they\u2019re as big as each other,\u201d Davies said. \u201cBuckley may be even bigger.\u201d\n\nAs of October 13, \u201cPoptub\u201d had a modest 3,594 subscribers on YouTube. That number could climb when its GCN component begins. But for all the reach Google\u2019s advertising network has, there are critics who contend that it doesn\u2019t deliver in another crucial Madison Avenue metric: engagement.\n\nAs ubiquitous as GCN is, it\u2019s still just an ad window on a Web page a person clicks on with the intention of consuming other content. And though a Google Gadget is an interactive application, some say it doesn\u2019t enable enough interactivity with the content.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old way of doing content syndication,\u201d said Jennifer Cooper, CEO of social media company Mixercast and the former director of a similar ad network at Yahoo.\n\nDan Goodman, president of the digital division at Media Rights Capital -- which brought together MacFarlane, sponsor Burger King and Google for \u201cCavalcade\u201d -- begs to differ. He credits GCN for driving much of the traffic to YouTube, where more than 112,000 people who watched \u201cCavalcade\u201d programing signed up as subscribers to the SethComedy channel.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve been extremely surprised about is the community that has built around the show on YouTube,\u201d he said.\n\nIn its first three weeks, \u201cCavalcade\u201d drew 14 million streams across its YouTube channel, GCN and SethComedy.com. The bulk of them are believed to have come from YouTube, but none of the parties involved would specify usage patterns beyond the 14 million figure.\n\n\u201cCavalcade\u201d is coming to the end of the 10 episodes that Burger King signed on to sponsor, but MRC is not revealing which brands will sponsor the other 40. While Goodman said those deals already are in place, the next sponsors might not show up until January. That said, \u201cCavalcade\u201d will stay fresh in the meantime by releasing a few episodes sans advertiser, a convenient way of releasing a few MacFarlane creations deemed too risque to get any brand on board.",
