        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s reshuffle of its senior ranks underscores the Internet company\u2019s evolving business ambitions, analysts say.\n\nThree years after co-founder Larry Page took the reins back as chief executive officer, his team of lieutenants is clearly undergoing a refresh.\n\nOn Thursday, Google announced the surprise departure of its veteran business chief Nikesh Arora, who will become Vice Chairman of SoftBank Corp.\n\nArora represents the latest in a string of personnel changes within Google\u2019s top ranks over the past 16 months, affecting major divisions from Youtube to its popular Android mobile software.\n\nIn some cases, the moves appear to be the result of personal circumstances or opportunities. Arora\u2019s role at SoftBank represents a promotion, analysts say.\n\nBut a half-dozen other top executives have left or switched roles in recent months. They included the departed Vic Gundotra, who oversaw the Google+ social network; and Salar Kamangar, who was CEO of YouTube before moving to another role.\n\nFresh faces now pictured on Google\u2019s senior management page include Craig Barratt, whose responsibilities include efforts building broadband networks and delivering wireless Internet access, and Lorraine Twohill, the head of marketing who was recently promoted to senior vice president.\n\nIt is unclear what motivated each individual move. But analysts say they suggest a general desire to have fresh eyes on key parts of the business as Google pursues growth areas.\n\n\u201cThe opportunities they\u2019re chasing are so much bigger now,\u201d said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t digging up fiber four years ago. They didn\u2019t have Chromecast,\u201d he said, referring to Google\u2019s ultra-high-speed fiber network and a device for streaming Web content to televisions.\n\nGoogle\u2019s transition to smartphones represents a key success in recent years. Now, it is seeking to extend Android\u2019s reach into televisions, smartwatches and cars.\n\nThis week, Google announced that former Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally was joining its board, bringing expertise and connections as Google seeks to play a bigger role in automobiles with its Android software and self-driving car technology.\n\nAndy Rubin, credited with making Android a hit, is now focused on building another potential area of growth for the company: robots.\n\nOther initiatives, such as the Google+ network launched to take on Facebook Inc, appear to have receded in priority, with the service barely mentioned at this year\u2019s developer conference.\n\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s online advertising business remains a reliable money-making machine, with revenue up 22 percent to $16 billion in the second quarter. Arora\u2019s departure should not cause any major hiccups, analysts said.\n\nHe will be replaced for now by Omid Kordestani, one of Google\u2019s early sales executives.\n\n\u201cGoogle is a pretty efficient machine, so I think they\u2019ll be able to plug in the up-and-coming person,\u201d said Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice, referring to Kordestani. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be too detrimental.\u201d",

        "body": "TOKYO, July 17 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co chief executive Carlos Ghosn said some car makers remain reticent about working with technology giant Google Inc as it develops driverless vehicles for fear of their brands\u2019 identities becoming submerged.\n\nGhosn, who also heads France\u2019s Renault, said car makers can benefit from collaborating with Google, which offers its Android software for cars and which is building prototypes of self-driving cars. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I think all car makers are extremely cautious about maintaining control on their own cars,\u201d he told a news conference in Tokyo on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe obviously don\u2019t want to become just a kind of a simple common hardware,\u201d Ghosn said. \u201cWe really want to keep the attractiveness of the product and the control on the product.\u201d\n\nNissan, along with General Motors, Volkwagen AG\u2019s Audi and Honda Motor Co, teamed up with Google this year to form the Open Automotive Alliance to incorporate the Android operating system into cars.\n\nGhosn previously set a target for Japan\u2019s third-biggest car maker to introduce its own self-driving vehicles on a commercial basis by 2020. On Thursday he said it\u2019s a goal for Nissan to become the first to introduce driverless cars on a mass scale so as to set the standard and boost its brand\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cThere is always a premium for those who come first because you are associating the brand with something that in the end everybody is going to get,\u201d he said.\n\nIn order to hit its 2020 target, Nissan plans to introduce systems that allow fully automated parking of cars and enable driverless cars to negotiate crowded highways, both by 2016. These innovations will be followed by technologies to allow the driverless cars to automatically change lanes and cross intersections in cities, Ghosn said.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for $15.61 billion in revenue.\n\nThe world\u2019s No.1 Internet search company said the number of \u201cpaid clicks\u201d by consumers on its ads increased 25 percent year-on-year in the quarter. But the average price of the ads declined 6 percent.\n\nGoogle earned $3.42 billion or $4.99 per share in the second quarter, versus $3.23 billion or $4.77 per share a year earlier. Excluding certain items, Google said it earned $6.08 a share.\n\nShares of Google were up roughly 1 percent in after hours trading on Thursday at $580.",
