The index still remains well below its historical average of around 20.\n\nGoogle Inc gained 2.2 percent to $593.52 as the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after the world\u2019s No.1 Internet search company posted second-quarter results and said its chief business officer would leave the company.\n\n\u201cIt seems counter-intuitive given the ruthlessness with which the market sold off yesterday, but in the broader context the markets are generating a lot of attractive themes,\u201d said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.\n\n\u201cWe have an economy that is expanding - we have many data points that support that narrative - we are in the middle of earnings season and earnings season has given investors reason to believe that what we have seen in the headlines over the last day or two, though very important, aren\u2019t what is driving investment decisions.\u201d\n\nGeneral Electric shed 1.2 percent to $26.30 after the conglomerate posted growth in second-quarter earnings that matched expectations.\n\nFellow Dow component IBM also lost ground, down 0.7 percent to $191.21 after the world\u2019s largest technology company reported its software business grew less than expected even as quarterly earnings beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nBut Honeywell International, a maker of aircraft cockpit parts and other electronic equipment, raised the lower end of its 2014 profit forecast range and reported better-than-expected quarterly profit. Its shares gained 0.8 percent to $95.97\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.66 points or 0.23 percent, to 17,015.47, the S&P 500 gained 6.9 points or 0.35 percent, to 1,965.02 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.59 points or 0.61 percent, to 4,390.04.\n\nThe Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary July reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 81.3, below both the consensus analyst expectation of 83 and the final June read of 82.5.\n\nS&P 500 companies\u2019 profits are expected to grow 4.9 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the 8.4 percent growth forecast at the start of April. Revenue is seen up 3 percent.\n\nThomson Reuters data also shows that of 66 companies in the S&P 500 that reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.2 percent beat Wall Street expectations, roughly in line with the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters and above the 63 percent rate since 1994.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York has granted prosecutors access to a Gmail user\u2019s emails as part of a criminal probe, a decision that could fan the debate over how aggressively the government may pursue data if doing so may invade people\u2019s privacy.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein said Friday he had authorized a warrant to be served on Google Inc for the emails of an unnamed individual who is the target of a money laundering investigation.\n\nGorenstein said his decision ran counter to several other judges\u2019 rulings in similar cases that sweeping warrants give the government improper access to too many emails, not just relevant ones.\n\nBut he said the law lets investigators review broad swaths of documents to decide which are covered by warrants.\n\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ruling came three months after U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in New York said prosecutors can force Microsoft Corp to hand over a customer\u2019s email stored in an Ireland data center.\n\nMicrosoft has appealed, in what is seen as the first challenge by a company to a warrant seeking data stored overseas.\n\nCompanies including Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and Apple Inc have filed briefs in support of Microsoft, as has the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group. A hearing is set for July 31 before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York.\n\nThe government\u2019s ability to seize personal information has grown more contentious since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked secret documents in June 2013 to media outlets outlining the agency\u2019s massive data collection programs.\n\nIn June, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled police generally need a warrant to search an arrested suspect\u2019s cellphone, citing privacy concerns.\n\nGorenstein\u2019s ruling joined a public debate playing out among several magistrate judges, who typically handle warrant requests. It is unusual to issue lengthy opinions on such matters particularly when, as in Gorenstein\u2019s case, the judge approves the application.\n\nIn April, John Facciola, a magistrate in Washington, D.C., rejected a warrant for the Apple email account of a defense contractor as part of a kickback investigation, one of several similar opinions he has authored recently.\n\nLast year, a Kansas magistrate denied warrant applications for emails and records at Google, Verizon, Yahoo! Inc, Microsoft unit Skype and GoDaddy in a stolen computer equipment case.\n\nBoth judges said the warrants were overly broad.\n\nOn the other hand, several U.S. appeals courts have rejected motions to suppress such searches, Gorenstein said.\n\nHanni Fakhoury, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, applauded Gorenstein for explaining his reasoning in writing, though he said he disagreed with the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe more voices and opinions we can add to the discussion, the better,\u201d he said in an email.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. consumer lawsuit accusing Google of monopolizing prime real estate on Android smartphones will help mobile rivals like Microsoft make their antitrust case with European regulators should damaging secrets emerge in court.\n\nThe suit, filed in California federal court in May by two smartphone consumers, said Google requires handset manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) to restrict competing apps like Microsoft\u2019s Bing search on Android phones, partly by making Google\u2019s own apps the default.\n\nGoogle argued last week the proposed class action should be dismissed because consumers still are free to use the other apps. The plaintiffs counter that most consumers either don\u2019t know how to switch default settings, or will not go to the trouble.\n\nIf a judge lets the lawsuit proceed, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys would be allowed to delve into internal Google emails and contracts with smartphone companies, and could interview Google executives under oath, said Steve Berman, who represents the consumers.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m confident we will get into juicy stuff, and I think that will up the pressure on Google as some of the material we discover becomes public,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. A hearing on Google\u2019s bid to dismiss the case is scheduled for October.\n\nAny damaging evidence from the class action would play into the hands of Google\u2019s rivals. Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans said the company \u201cis not a party\u201d to the consumer lawsuit, but last year a group of companies - including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Oracle (ORCL.N), Nokia NOK1V.HE, Expedia (EXPE.O) and TripAdvisor (TRIP.O) - filed a complaint with European antitrust regulators over some of the same issues in the U.S. lawsuit.\n\nGoogle apps \u201care widely used on Android by requiring default placement and other mechanisms for disadvantaging competing apps,\u201d the companies said in a summary of their complaint.\n\nGoogle last year said it was working cooperatively with European regulators, who have yet to decide whether to formally investigate.\n\nBerman has a long history of taking on large U.S. companies. He reached a settlement for consumers suing Apple (AAPL.O) over its e-book sales practices that could reach $450 million, and settled for $1.6 billion a lawsuit on behalf of Toyota (7203.T) car owners with unintended acceleration claims.\n\nBut the Seattle-based plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer also has represented one of Google\u2019s main rivals. Berman defended Microsoft when it faced its own antitrust investigations over Windows. Berman said he has had \u201cconversations with Microsoft over the years about Google\u2019s conduct,\u201d but not about this lawsuit.\n\nNo stranger to antitrust inquiries, Google was scrutinized by U.S. and European regulators over allegations that it improperly manipulated search results to rank its own services higher than competitors.\n\nU.S. authorities ultimately closed their investigation without filing a lawsuit, and Europe\u2019s competition commissioner negotiated a settlement earlier this year which is awaiting approval by the broader European Commission.\n\nThe main issue for U.S. courts will be whether Android and mobile services like search are \u201ctechnically separate, or tied in ways that impedes competition for consumers,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.\n\nCusumano has extensively researched Microsoft, which unsuccessfully sued the professor in the 1990s for access to his notes. This year Microsoft has sought to hire him to write an expert opinion in an unrelated proceeding.\n\nThe U.S. consumer lawsuit is based largely on contracts between Google and Android manufacturers Samsung and HTC (2498.TW) that became public during Oracle\u2019s separate 2012 trial against Google.\n\nIf Samsung or HTC wishes to use Google apps on its phones, the consumer lawsuit said, they must preload a suite of services - including YouTube and Maps - on \u201cprime screen real estate\u201d on the phones, and set Google search as the default.\n\nIt also argues that Google\u2019s deal with Apple to be the default search on iPhones and iPads locks out competitors across the mobile universe. Apple does not have its own search engine, has lower market share worldwide than Android and is not a defendant in the case.\n\nGoogle\u2019s deals with handset makers do not prevent rival search engines \u201cfrom reaching consumers through the various distribution channels available to them,\u201d Google wrote in its motion to dismiss the U.S. lawsuit.\n\nCusumano said the U.S. class action could hurt Google if a judge finds that it improperly pushes its mapping and location services, which is embedded across the Android system.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ckind of a Pandora\u2019s Box to look inside what Google does, and the relationship it has with all these smartphone and handset manufacturers,\u201d he said.",
