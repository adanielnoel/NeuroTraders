        "body": "(Reuters) - Ryanair has launched legal proceedings against Google and online travel agent eDreams in the Irish High Court over what it says are misleading adverts for Ryanair flights, the airline said on Tuesday.\n\nRyanair said Google was allowing eDreams to use \u201cmisleading subdomain\u201d www.Ryanair.eDreams.com and a web site with branding similar to Ryanair\u2019s to sell tickets at higher prices than on Ryanair\u2019s own web site.\n\n\u201cFollowing Google\u2019s refusal to stop these false advertising practices (which are in breach of Google\u2019s own code of conduct), Ryanair has been left with no alternative than to take legal proceedings against both eDreams and Google,\u201d Ryanair said in a statement.\n\nEDreams said in an emailed statement that it \u201cdisagreed strongly\u201d with Ryanair\u2019s position and said the legal action was an attempt to stop online travel agencies from offering consumers the best price and choice.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.",
