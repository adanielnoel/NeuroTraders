        "body": "* Google invests as it tries to re-establish China presence\n\nBEIJING, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Google will take a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence firm Mobvoi as part of a $75 million fundraising round, the start-up said on Tuesday, as the U.S. search giant tries to rebuild its presence in China.\n\nMobvoi works on artificial intelligence (AI) voice-controlled software, like that used in Google\u2019s Android products for mobile search, and also develops hardware like smart watches. Google\u2019s parent company is now named Alphabet Inc .\n\nThe Google-led Series C fundraising values Mobvoi at $300 million, with the start-up maintaining a controlling stake, said co-founder Li Yuanyuan in a telephone interview. The size of the U.S. firm\u2019s investment was not disclosed by Li or in Mobvoi\u2019s e-mailed statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal, not Google\u2019s first in China but one of few, comes as the company seeks to re-establish itself in the world\u2019s largest Internet market by population of users.\n\nBecause services like its search, e-mail and mapping are blocked in China, the U.S. firm is trying to cement partnerships with domestic providers like Mobvoi, which offers technology similar to Apple Inc\u2019s Siri and Google\u2019s own version.\n\nMobvoi previously partnered with Google to provide Chinese-language voice search for the latter\u2019s Android Wear smartwatch operating system. The Chinese firm will use the money from its fundraising to invest in AI and robotics research.\n\nMobvoi is also developing voice search to be integrated into vehicles and a robot for families in China, said Li.\n\nWhen contacted, a Singapore-based Google spokesman declined to elaborate on how the Mobvoi investment fit with its China strategy.\n\nAlthough Google has maintained an engineering and sales presence in China, it largely withdrew its services out of China five years ago after refusing to continue self-censoring search results.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai has made no secret that he wants to get back into China, with his bet riding on Google Play, the app store for its Android mobile operating system, despite it currently being borderline inaccessible in China. He faces an uphill struggle. (Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc said on Tuesday it had signed a search advertising deal with Google Inc, providing a potential boost to Marissa Mayer\u2019s efforts to turn around the company, which also reported revenue and profit that fell short of market estimates.\n\nThe deal with Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, builds on an existing search partnership Microsoft Corp under which Yahoo gets a percentage of revenue from ads displayed on its sites.\n\nYahoo, whose shares were down 1.6 percent in after-hours trading, said the companies have agreed to delay implementation of the deal in the United States to allow the antitrust division of the Department of Justice to review it.\n\nYahoo has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Google and Facebook.\n\nThe Google deal was one of the few bright spots included in the company\u2019s third-quarter results statement.\n\nYahoo said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $1.16 billion\u2013$1.20 billion, well below the average analyst estimate of $1.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nMayer, in her fourth year as chief executive, said the forecast was \u201cnot indicative of the performance we want.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are also experiencing continued revenue headwinds in our core (advertising) business, especially in the legacy portions,\u201d Mayer said on a call with analysts.\n\nYahoo said the proposed spinoff of its 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - a key issue for shareholders - may now close in January.\n\nYahoo earlier this year sought a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to confirm whether the transaction, worth about $27 billion currently, would result in a tax obligation. The tax agency denied the request, but Yahoo said it would go ahead with the spinoff by year-end anyway.\n\nMany analysts attribute little value to Yahoo\u2019s core business without its Asian assets, which also include a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp.\n\nApart from the Google deal, the only other good news came results came from Yahoo\u2019s emerging businesses, which Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising.\n\nRevenue in that area rose 43 percent to $422 million in the quarter. Native advertising refers to ads that blend into the type and style of the content being viewed.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned 15 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 17 cents.\n\nRevenue after deducting fees paid to partner websites fell to $1.0 billion from $1.09 billion, and the company forecast a drop to $920 million-$960 million in the current quarter.\n\nTraffic acquisition costs, the amount Yahoo spends to attract users to its websites, jumped to $223 million in the quarter from $54 million a year earlier.\n\nGAAP revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.23 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThrough Tuesday\u2019s close of $32.83, Yahoo\u2019s shares had lost 35 percent this year.",
