        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O) on Thursday reported a disappointing quarterly profit and aggressive spending plans to support a widening range of Web services, unnerving investors who sent its shares down 8 percent.\n\nThe world\u2019s top Internet company said it expected to continue to make \u201csignificant capital expenditures\u201d after spending $678 million in the fourth quarter on data centers, computers and networks -- well above analysts\u2019 forecasts.\n\nBut Google executives said they were seeing no signs of deterioration of the U.S. economy in their own business and expect advertisers will maintain spending with Google even if they start to slash budgets.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen any impact yet from the rumors of future recessions,\u201d Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt told investors on a conference call, confronting fears that have clobbered Google shares and global stock markets in the past month.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue was slightly shy of Wall Street targets, however, and the rising level of payments to affiliated sites that show Google ads, called traffic acquisition costs, also surprised some.\n\n\u201cThe traffic acquisition costs came in much higher than expected and suggests that some of the big deals with their partners may have been renegotiated with higher terms for the partners,\u201d said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at RBC Capital.\n\nThe results were disappointing given the Web search leader\u2019s track record of beating expectations, he added.\n\nFourth-quarter net income rose to $1.21 billion, or $3.79 per diluted share, from $1.03 billion, or $3.29 per diluted share, in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nExcluding special items, earnings per share amounted to $4.43, falling short of analysts\u2019 average forecast of $4.47, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nRevenue rose 51 percent to $4.827 billion. Analysts, on average, had predicted revenue of $4.83 billion, with estimates ranging from $4.67 billion to $5.10 billion.\n\n\u201cThere was a slight softness in revenue which perhaps portends softness going forward due to the ... U.S. economy,\u201d said Clayton Moran of Stanford Group.\n\nAdvertising sales in Britain, Google\u2019s second-largest market after the United States, grew just 5 percent, or less than half the rate of the final quarter of 2006, amid weak holiday spending by financial services and travel advertisers.\n\nCapital spending grew 20 percent in the fourth quarter over the third quarter of 2007 and was up 85 percent from the final quarter of 2006. Citigroup had warned that spending above $600 million during the quarter would be a negative sign.\n\nGoogle, which derived virtually all its $16.6 billion in 2007 revenue by selling pay-per-click online advertising, said growth in the percentage of paid clicks slowed to 30 percent -- only half as fast as the 61 percent growth rate for the closely watched metric in fourth quarter of the previous year.\n\nCo-founder Sergey Brin said the company has been seeking to pare back low-quality advertisements, which had affected ad click rates. \u201cI am not worried by that at all. It is not a way we measure things internally,\u201d Brin said in an interview.\n\nGoogle shares traded at $524.87 in extended trading, down from their Nasdaq close of $564.30.\n\nThe stock has fallen 24 percent in the month of January. A stock market darling among technology issues during 2007, the stock has fallen from levels near $750 in November, when many analysts raced to boost Google price targets as high as $900.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been in the momentum-buying category for some time now and market conditions are harsh for momentum stocks when they miss,\u201d said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, which manages $22.5 billion.\n\n\u201cSo we expect the stock has further to go in terms of a price readjustment,\u201d he said, adding that it could take months for selling pressures to ease. His fund will hold its positions in the shares but not buy more until the pressures dissipate.\n\nOn a price to earnings measure, the volatile stock has traded between 29 and 59 in the past two years, with a 39 P/E on average, Citigroup estimates. It now trades at 29 times the average 2008 profit estimate, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nGoogle slowed the pace of hiring dramatically in the fourth quarter, increasing the number of full-time employees to 16,805, up just 5.5 percent from the end of the third quarter. The company\u2019s hiring growth rate has grown in double digits each quarter for several years and has been controversial with analysts who say Google needs to keep a tighter rein on costs.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O) on Thursday reported disappointing quarterly results on rising capital spending and costs for acquiring advertising customers, unnerving investors who sent its shares down 6.5 percent.\n\nRevenue rose 51 percent to $4.827 billion, just shy of the $4.83 billion, on average, analysts had forecast. A rising level of payments to affiliated sites that deliver Google ads, called traffic acquisition costs, also surprised some.\n\n\u201cThis quarter was softer-than-expected across the board,\u201d Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Derek Brown said. \u201cRevenue from Google Web sites was a little bit lower and traffic acquisition costs were slightly higher than we had expected.\u201d\n\nThe disappointment was especially pronounced given the Web search leader\u2019s record of beating expectations, analysts said. It was only the third time in 14 quarters as a public company that Google failed to top Wall Street profit forecasts.\n\nBut Google executives underscored their belief that there were no signs that a weakening U.S. economy so far was hurting its own results and that they expect advertisers to maintain spending with Google even if they slash overall ad budgets.\n\n\u201cWe have not yet seen any negative impact from the rumors of future recessions,\u201d Chief Executive Eric Schmidt told investors on a conference call, challenging investor psychology that has clobbered global stock markets in the past month.\n\nRival Yahoo Inc YHOO.O said on Tuesday that key online ad categories remained strong, but it had felt weakness in travel, financial and retail. Yahoo depends on display ads preferred by brand marketers, while Google\u2019s focus is on Web search ads.\n\nGoogle\u2019s fourth-quarter net income rose to $1.21 billion, or $3.79 per diluted share, from $1.03 billion, or $3.29 per diluted share, in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding special items, earnings per share were $4.43, short of analysts\u2019 average forecast of $4.47, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nWall Street analysts said Google\u2019s weaker-than-expected results had any number of contributing factors.\n\n\u201cThey missed on revenue -- not by much -- but for the first time in a while,\u201d Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said. \u201cI don\u2019t think economic weakness has arrived yet,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey face competitive issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle is not taking share away from the other guys as easily as it was,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cThe company is at the point where the raw gains in growth don\u2019t mask the trends in the marketplace so much anymore.\u201d\n\nExecutives acknowledged Google has struggled to make inroads selling ads on social network sites -- now the Web\u2019s hottest market -- such as News Corp\u2019s NWSa.N MySpace.\n\nLindsay speculated Google is having trouble making money on its $900 million, three-year deal to sell advertising to MySpace customers.\n\nRising traffic acquisition costs may reflect the fact that Google pays MySpace whether or not it makes money selling ads on MySpace. \u201cIt\u2019s a toxic deal for Google,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cThat is eating into margins.\u201d\n\nAd sales in Britain, Google\u2019s second-largest market after the United States, grew just 5 percent, or less than half the rate of the final quarter of 2006, amid weak holiday spending by financial services and travel advertisers.\n\nCapital spending grew 20 percent in the fourth quarter over the third quarter of 2007 and was up 85 percent from the final quarter of 2006. Citigroup had warned that spending above $600 million during the quarter would be a negative sign.\n\nGoogle shares traded at $527.40 in extended trading, down from their Nasdaq close of $564.30. Immediately following the results, the stock fell to around $510, down 9.5 percent.\n\nThe stock fell 24 percent in January. A 2007 darling among technology stocks, it has fallen from near $750 in November, when analysts raced to boost price targets as high as $900.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been in the momentum-buying category for some time now and market conditions are harsh for momentum stocks when they miss,\u201d said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, which manages $22.5 billion.\n\n\u201cSo we expect the stock has further to go in terms of a price readjustment,\u201d he said, adding that it could take months for selling pressures to ease.

It now trades at 29 times the average 2008 estimate, which Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen marks as \u201cgrowth at a reasonable price.\u201d\n\nGoogle slowed the pace of hiring dramatically in the fourth quarter. Its 16,805 full-time employees was up just 5.5 percent from the end of the third quarter. The quarterly hiring growth rate had been in double digits for years, leading analysts to call for Google to keep a tighter rein on costs.
