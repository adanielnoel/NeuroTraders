        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s quarterly results beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations as the Internet search giant expanded its mobile and overseas businesses while keeping ad-rate declines in check, sending its shares to a record high.\n\nThe market reaction put Google\u2019s stock within striking distance of $1,000, following what analysts said was a strong, but not spectacular quarter.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s No.1 Internet search engine jumped 8 percent to $959.65 in after-hours trading on Thursday, after it reported a 23 percent rise in revenue from its Internet business, excluding fees paid to partners, of $10.8 billion in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cExpectations going into earnings were a little muted,\u201d said Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice. \u201cThey did what they needed to do to impress investors.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s business, like rivals Facebook Inc and Yahoo Inc, has come under pressure as more consumers access its online services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, where advertising rates are lower than on PCs.\n\nThe average cost-per-click - the price that marketers pay Google when consumers click on their ads - decreased 8 percent during the third quarter, deepening the 6 percent price erosion that Google experienced in the second quarter.\n\nBut the total amount of paid clicks increased 26 percent year-on-year during the three months ended September 30, the highest rate of growth in one year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key story, their ad volume growth is outpacing the decline in cost-per-clicks,\u201d said JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey.\n\nRoughly 40 percent of the traffic to YouTube, the Google-owned video website, now occurs on mobile devices, Google Chief Executive Larry Page said on Thursday. Two years ago, only 6 percent of YouTube\u2019s traffic occurred on mobile devices.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s done a good job of being in the right place in mobile as it grows, and being able to monetize that,\u201d said Rice.\n\nHe also pointed to Google\u2019s 28 percent revenue growth outside of the U.S. and Britain as further signs of Google\u2019s strength.\n\nGoogle\u2019s results offered a sharp contrast to online rival Yahoo Inc, which reported a slight dip in quarterly revenue on Tuesday and lowered its financial outlook.\n\nOn Thursday, co-founder and CEO Page told analysts he will no longer be joining the company\u2019s quarterly earnings conference calls on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cI know you all would love to have me on, but you\u2019re also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business,\u201d Page said, without providing further explanation for the change.\n\nPage, who with Sergey Brin conceived of what is today the world\u2019s most-used Internet search engine, is not known for assiduously courting Wall Street investors. And this year, Page revealed that his vocal cords are partially paralyzed as the result of a rare medical condition.\n\nNeedham & Co\u2019s Rice said he did not expect Page to be any less involved in running the company, noting that Amazon.com Inc\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos does not participate in the quarterly earnings calls.\n\nGoogle executives also provided few details on the recently-launched MotoX smartphone, the flagship device within Google\u2019s Motorola mobile phone business.\n\nOperating losses at Motorola were $248 million during the third quarter, compared to a loss of $192 million in the third quarter of 2012.\n\nGoogle\u2019s consolidated business earned $2.97 billion, or $8.75 per share in the three months ended September 30, compared to $2.18 billion, or $6.53 per share, last year.\n\nExcluding certain items, Google said it earned $10.74 per share, compared to the $10.34 that analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nConsolidated revenue of $14.89 billion compared with the $14.79 billion average analyst estimate.",
