        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has emerged as one of the biggest Silicon Valley companies to have resisted rivals\u2019 entreaties to stop poaching each other\u2019s employees, according to emails between the No. 1 social network and Google Inc released in court filings.\n\nSheryl Sandberg had just been installed as Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer when one of her former colleagues from Google emailed her, according to the filings unsealed late last week. Facebook\u2019s aggressive recruitment of Google employees had heightened tensions between the two companies to \u201cDefcon 2,\u201d top Google executive Jonathan Rosenberg told Sandberg in August 2008.\n\n\u201cFix this problem. Propose that you will substantially lower the rate at which you hire people from us,\u201d Rosenberg told Sandberg in an email. \u201cThen make sure that happens.\u201d\n\nBut Sandberg deflected Rosenberg\u2019s entreaties, saying she thought Google only had limited no-solicitation agreements with companies with which it shared board members, not blanket no-hire policies with other companies.\n\nPlaintiffs say companies like Apple Inc, Google and Intel Corp drove down wages by agreeing to avoid soliciting employees from each other.\n\n\u201cI declined at that time to limit Facebook\u2019s recruitment or hiring of Google employees,\u201d Sandberg wrote in a sworn declaration submitted by the plaintiffs in court.\n\nThat response had made Facebook a witness, rather than a defendant, in a massive antitrust lawsuit brought by tech workers against the largest players in Silicon Valley.\n\nA Facebook representative declined to comment on Monday, while a Google spokesman could not immediately be reached.\n\nIn past statements, Google said it has always \u201cactively and aggressively\u201d recruited top talent.\n\nHarry First, a professor at New York University School of Law who specializes in antitrust, said on Monday the exchange between Sandberg and Rosenberg at a minimum confirms how board relationships between the tech companies initially drove the agreements not to solicit from each other, which then expanded from there.\n\n\u201cThat does not look good to the jury,\u201d First said.\n\nHowever, the defendants can also argue that the refusal of companies like Facebook to limit hiring shows that any alleged conspiracy could not have impacted the broader job market and wages in general.\n\nIn 2010, Google, Apple, Adobe Systems Inc, Intel and others agreed to a settlement of a U.S. Justice Department probe that barred them from agreeing not to poach each other\u2019s employees.\n\nThe companies have since been fighting the civil antitrust lawsuit. They argue the plaintiffs cannot successfully prove an overarching conspiracy to impact wages.\n\nFacebook is not the only Silicon Valley company which rejected a request to curtail its hiring efforts. In 2007, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs threatened to file a patent lawsuit against Palm if that company\u2019s chief executive didn\u2019t agree to refrain from poaching Apple employees, according to correspondence filed in court.\n\nHowever, then Palm CEO Edward Colligan told Jobs that the plan was \u201clikely illegal,\u201d and that Palm was not \u201cintimidated\u201d by the threat.\n\n\u201cIf you choose the litigation route, we can respond with our own claims based on patent assets, but I don\u2019t think litigation is the answer,\u201d Colligan said.\n\nTrial in the hiring class action is scheduled to begin in May.\n\nThe civil case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 11-cv-2509.",
