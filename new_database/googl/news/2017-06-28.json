The biggest sanction prior to that was U.S. chipmaker Intel\u2019s (INTC.O) 1.06 billion euro fine in 2009.\n\nThe Commission found that Google had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results.\n\nThe Commission wants the company to stop that, or face additional non-compliance payments of five percent of Alphabet\u2019s average daily global turnover.\n\nThe action came after a seven-year long investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp (YELP.N), TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp (NWSA.O) and lobbying group FairSearch.\n\nGoogle may choose to appeal in EU courts, but Intel, the previous antitrust fine record holder, has waited seven years for a final judgment on its appeal.\n\nGoogle remains under Commission investigation in two other cases. These concern its Android mobile operating system, where the company is charged with \u201crequiring and incentivising\u201d manufacturers to prioritize its apps and web services, and Google\u2019s \u201cAdSense for Search\u201d platform, allegedly used to restrict search ads from rivals.\n\nGoogle and other US-based internet companies face increasing scrutiny and regulation from the EU regarding user privacy and data storage, most recently on messaging, email and voice services.\n\nThe EU largely expects greater cooperation from tech companies on cyber security and counter-terrorism. Last week\u2019s European Council Summit called for the industry to step up efforts to remove extremist content and disrupt communication support for terrorist acts.\n\nOn Monday, Facebook , Google\u2019s YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft responded with the announcement of a Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.\n\nThe Commission has a number of ongoing cases involving technology giants, notably Qualcomm which was accused in 2015 of using financial incentives and predatory pricing to force out competition.

        "header": "With Alphabet, Google faces a daunting challenge: organizing itself",
        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google\u2019s self-professed mission is to organize the world\u2019s information. But a company known for engineering excellence is still trying to solve the very human problem of how to organize itself.\n\nNearly two years ago, Google co-founder Larry Page announced the tech giant would be remade as Alphabet, a holding company whose units would include Google and an array of unrelated pursuits in areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars and urban planning.\n\nWall Street cheered. Previously those riskier ventures had been lumped into Google\u2019s overall financial results. Investors would now see Google\u2019s performance independent of its so-called \u201cOther Bets,\u201d an eclectic collection of 11 ventures. They include Nest, a maker of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats; Calico, which seeks to prolong the human lifespan; and X, the company\u2019s secretive research lab.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s top management also aimed to boost accountability by appointing chief executives to head each of the Other Bets. Few people in Google\u2019s constellation of ventures had ever held the title prior to that.\n\nBut so far Alphabet has failed to show it can convert its Other Bets from experiments to businesses with the reach, impact and money-making potential of Google\u2019s core search and advertising operations. Interviews with two dozen former Alphabet executives and employees reveal an organization grappling with how much time and resources Other Bets deserve in the pursuit of profitability.\n\nIn the first quarter, which ended March 31, the ventures lost a combined $855 million; that\u2019s on top of a collective $3.6 billion loss for 2016. As a whole, Alphabet generated $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016. Google\u2019s share of that revenue was $89.5 billion, while its 2016 operating income was $27.9 billion.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s early days have seen more pruning than expansion of its holdings.\n\nThe company has skinned back plans for Google Fiber, which delivers rapid Internet service in 10 metro areas. This month, Alphabet agreed to sell robotics company Boston Dynamics to Japanese multinational SoftBank Group Corp. It unloaded its Terra Bella satellite imaging business in February.\n\nAt one point last year, it was even looking to sell Nest, the largest of the Other Bets, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Google paid an eye-popping $3.2 billion for the start-up in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of executives have departed since the reorganization, including the heads of Nest, an Internet operation called Access and a venture capital firm known as GV.\n\nAn Alphabet spokeswoman declined repeated requests for comment or to make executives available for interviews. Supporters of the restructuring frame the early struggles as typical growing pains.\n\nFor now, Wall Street isn\u2019t worried: Alphabet\u2019s stock is near an all-time high, having reached $1,000 per share in June. Ruth Porat, the no-nonsense chief financial officer who has steered the restructuring, has won rave reviews from investors for enforcing financial accountability across Alphabet.\n\nSome Other Bets have made notable strides. Life sciences initiative Verily recently attracted $800 million in outside investment. Self-driving car project Waymo is considered among the leaders in the burgeoning industry.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not yet clear the structure will enable Alphabet to do what most companies cannot: conceive the next wave of innovation in-house or through the development of key acquisitions. That goal is central to both the company\u2019s mission and investor expectations, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe reason Google gets to trade at a decent multiple\u2026 is because there\u2019s a growth story beyond advertising,\u201d said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management.\n\nThe Alphabet structure is Google\u2019s stab at an age-old corporate conundrum: sustaining innovation within a giant enterprise.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s strategy is to give entrepreneurs the autonomy of a startup, coupled with the discipline of a traditional corporate structure.\n\nRoughly once a quarter, Other Bets leaders meet with the Alphabet board \u2013 comprised of Porat, Page, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and David Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s senior vice president of corporate development \u2013 to discuss funding and performance, according to two former employees.\n\nAt the same time, Alphabet is establishing separate compensation plans for the Other Bets to reward employees if their ventures succeed, mirroring startup incentives.\n\nThe formula has primed Alphabet\u2019s emerging businesses for \u201cglobal impact,\u201d Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said this month at the annual stockholders meeting at the Mountain View headquarters.\n\n\u201cThere is one solution that we know works well in capitalism, which is boards, shareholders, CEOs,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cMy bet is that the traditional lessons of business organization will in fact result in success at Alphabet.\u201d\n\nStill, Alphabet top brass continue to hold sway over key strategy and financing decisions, a dynamic that has chafed Other Bets chief executives who\u2019ve complained they are treated more like chief operating officers than shot callers, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nIn addition, scrutiny from Wall Street limits how generous Alphabet can be in extending Google\u2019s resources to Other Bets, said Brian McClendon, a former vice president of engineering at Google.\n\n\u201cAs of yet, the restructuring hasn\u2019t provided what I think is one of the immediate benefits, which is risk-taking investment,\u201d he said.\n\nSome companies acquired by Google found that being part of Alphabet wasn\u2019t what they\u2019d bargained for.\n\nTwo former Nest employees said they were promised generous funding and time to achieve profitability following the company\u2019s acquisition by Google in 2014. But after the restructuring, Alphabet executives were keenly focused on revenue, one former employee said.\n\nPricey overhead has made the path to profitability tougher. After the restructuring, Alphabet began charging Other Bets for their portion of shared services such as security and facilities, ending what had previously amounted to a subsidy, people familiar with the situation said. The units also felt pressure to maintain Google perks such as free employee meals.\n\n\u201cOne of the pitfalls (of Alphabet) is that those companies are asked to stand on their own two feet, but they may inherit the cost structure of Google,\u201d said Nest investor Peter Nieh, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nIn early 2016, Alphabet explored selling Nest in an effort code-named Project Amalfi, according to three people familiar with the matter. No deal materialized, and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell departed last year. Fadell declined to comment.\n\nBoston Dynamics, acquired in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, enjoyed generous funding at first. But it was adrift after Rubin\u2019s departure, two former employees said. Rubin did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe creation of the Other Bets has also changed what it means to work for Google.\n\nSome grumble that their role now is to subsidize innovation at their sister companies, rather than to innovate themselves.\n\n\u201cIt did sort of send the message to people who stayed back at Google, whether in search or in ads: Your job isn\u2019t to push the envelope,\u201d one former Googler said.\n\nEmployee transfers to X, the illustrious \u201cmoonshot factory,\u201d are more complicated now that it\u2019s a separate entity, former employees say.\n\nThat\u2019s a striking shift, especially for high-performing employees accustomed to moving about the company almost at will, said Punit Soni, a former Google employee who is now chief executive of Learning Motors, an artificial intelligence startup.\n\n\u201cA basic premise of Google was people could do whatever they wanted,\u201d Soni said. \u201cI can see why people will feel like it\u2019s no longer the old Google.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, co-founder Page is pursuing yet another \u201cmoonshot\u201d: flying cars.\n\nHe is the primary investor in Kitty Hawk, a startup in the field that is entirely outside the Alphabet umbrella.",

        "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators hit Google with a record 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7 billion) fine for favouring its own shopping service, taking a tough line in the first of three probes of its dominance in searches and smartphone operating systems.\n\nIt is the biggest fine the European Commission has ever imposed on a single company in an antitrust case, exceeding a 1.06-billion-euro sanction handed down against U.S. chipmaker Intel in 2009 and goes far beyond what U.S. regulators have ever fined a tech company.\n\nEuropean Union competition chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday gave Google 90 days to stop favouring its own shopping service in internet searches or face a further daily penalty of up to 5 percent of parent company Alphabet\u2019s average daily global revenue.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers. It wasn\u2019t just about making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine,\u201d she told a news conference.\n\nThe fine will be easy for the world\u2019s biggest search engine to absorb, but Google must now move fast to satisfy Vestager\u2019s concerns while limiting the longer-term hit to its highly lucractive search business. It also leaves other tech companies wondering how far Vestager may go to force U.S. tech giants to concede more ground to smaller competitors.\n\nVestager has become one of the world\u2019s most combative antitrust regulators with powers to impose multi-billion dollar fines and force companies to make radical changes to their businesses.\n\nLast year, the former Danish economy minister ordered Apple to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of 13 billion euros as it ruled the company had received illegal state aid. Apple is appealing the decision.\n\nThe decision is the first of a series of competition rulings that Google faces from the European Commission, which has not shrunk from taking on U.S. tech giants such as Alphabet, which has annual revenues of $90 billion and a market value of $665 billion.\n\nThe Commission has also charged Google with using its Android mobile operating system to crush rivals, a case that could potentially be the most damaging for the company, as it is the system used in most smartphones.\n\nThe company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising.\n\nThe Commission found that Google, with a market share in searches of over 90 percent in most European countries, had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results.\n\nVestager said in a statement that Google had \u201cdenied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d\n\nGoogle said its data showed people preferred links taking them directly to products they want and not to websites where they have to repeat their search.\n\n\u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,\u201d Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement.\n\nAlphabet, whose shares were down about 1 percent, said in a separate statement it would review the Commission\u2019s formal decision but expected to accrue the fine in the second quarter.\n\nThe biggest risk to Google is not the fine but the changes demanded to its business, said Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies.\n\nGoogle will have to brief the Commission on what measures it plans to take within 60 days of the decision and present periodic reports. Eight complainants were involved in the case which the EU declined to name in line with its policy.\n\nAccording to Windsor\u2019s calculations, the 2.42-billion-euro fine represents just 22.6 days of the operating cash flow that Alphabet reported in its latest quarter.\n\n\u201cWhat has the potential to hurt Google and be far more damaging is what remedies the European Commission may or may not impose on Google as a result,\u201d Windsor said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the real damage could be done.\u201d\n\nThe fine, equivalent to 3 percent of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, is the biggest regulatory setback for Google, which settled with U.S. enforcers in 2013 without a penalty after agreeing to change some of its search practices.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s action follows a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp, TripAdvisor, UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp and lobbying group FairSearch.\n\nNews Corp said it applauded \u201cthe European Commission\u2019s leadership in confronting the discriminatory behavior of Google in the comparison shopping industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,\u201d it said in a statement, accusing Google of profiting from \u201ccommodifying content and enabling the proliferation of flawed and fake news.\u201d\n\nThe penalty payment for failure to comply would amount to around $12 million a day based on Alphabet\u2019s 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion.\n\n\u201cThis decision is a game-changer. The Commission confirmed that consumers do not see what is most relevant for them on the world\u2019s most used search engine but rather what is best for Google,\u201d said Monique Goyens, director general of EU consumer group BEUC.\n\nThomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings and urged it to act on Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system following its 2013 complaint that Google restricted competition in software running on mobile devices.
