        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - A British parliamentary committee will ask Google to testify about a back tax deal under which it will pay 130 million pounds ($185 million) to settle claims covering a 10-year period -- an amount the opposition Labour party has described as derisory.\n\nMeg Hillier, the Labour party chairwoman of parliament\u2019s Public Accounts Committee, tweeted at the weekend she would call Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, and the UK tax authority (HMRC) to explain the \u201ccosy deal\u201d.\n\nGoogle said it was a fair deal and that it complied with all tax rules. HMRC said the deal meant Google \u201cwill pay the full tax due in law.\u201d\n\nFinance minister George Osborne said the agreement represented a victory for the action the government had taken against corporate tax avoidance.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron\u2019s spokesman described it as \u201ca step forward\u201d but acknowledged there was more to do to ensure companies paid their fair share.\n\nCorporate tax avoidance has prompted anger in recent years among citizens who question whether the burden of paying the cost of combating the financial crisis was evenly shared.\n\nA study conducted by accountants PricewaterhouseCooper for the 100 Group, a lobby body representing around 100 of the biggest UK companies, showed their combined corporation tax bill was half 2010 levels in 2015, despite rising profits.\n\nBusinesses say they benefit the exchequer in other ways such as collecting VAT (sales tax) on behalf of the government and employing staff who pay income taxes.\n\nGoogle\u2019s tax deal brings its total UK tax bill over the period to around 200 million pounds.\n\nOver the period, its total of around 24 billion pounds in UK revenues would have generated a tax bill of almost 2 billion, if the UK unit reported taxable profits in line with group margins of around 30 percent, according to Reuters calculations based on Google filings.\n\nGoogle\u2019s tax bill is reduced because profits from its European sales are channeled to Bermuda. Google says its Bermuda operation does not impact the tax it pays in the UK.\n\nExecutives say the reported UK profit margins are far below the group average because most of its algorithms and codes, which drive the company\u2019s profits, are developed outside the country.\n\nIn 2013, the company faced a parliamentary inquiry after a Reuters investigation showed the firm employed hundreds of salespeople in Britain despite saying it did not conduct sales in the country, a key plank in its tax arrangements.",
