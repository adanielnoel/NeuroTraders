        "body": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Russia\u2019s leading internet search engine, Yandex, will take the fight to Google in emerging markets like Turkey in a bid to offset the inroads made by the U.S. giant in its home market.\n\nYandex founder and chief executive Arkady Volozh told Reuters on Friday the firm was likely to use its own experts to expand into new countries, but would not rule out acquisitions or partnership deals.\n\n\u201cWe are focusing on the markets with Google dominance in search ... where they have 90-plus percent market share,\u201d Volozh said in an interview in Dublin, adding Yandex would stress to consumers the dangers of one firm dominating the internet.\n\nYandex is currently focusing on Turkey, where it has eked out a 1 percent market share since it entered the market last year. It describes this as a base for a significant expansion and says it will look to other large markets where it sees no real competition to Google, though Volozh refused to name them.\n\nYandex, which raised $1.4 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) in New York last year, has seen its share of the Russian search market fall to 60 percent in the second quarter from 64 percent a year earlier, according to LiveInternet.\n\nThat is partly due to inroads made by Google.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be growing 30 percent or something next year, but it\u2019s not doubling every year as we used to have four or five years ago. We need to find some new markets, new opportunities ... it could improve our revenues dramatically,\u201d Volozh said.\n\nYandex posted revenues of 20 billion roubles ($648 million)last year and has a market capitalization of $7.2 billion.\n\nGoogle is also under pressure from slowing revenue, shocking analysts on Thursday by reporting quarterly revenue growth of 17 percent year-over-year, the first time its growth has fallen below 20 percent since 2009.\n\nDespite the drive to expand abroad, Yandex will defend its market share at home against rivals like Google and Microsoft, which use proprietary browser and operating systems to encourage users onto their search products, Volozh said.\n\nLast month Yandex launched a browser to compete with Google\u2019s Chrome. Norwegian mobile internet browser maker Opera has signed a licensing deal with Yandex to share its browser technology.\n\nThe Russian search engine has no plans to follow Google into the hardware market, where it builds mobile phones and tablets, but it would consider it if necessary.\n\n\u201cWe will see where we will need to go. Whatever we need to preserve our market share we will do,\u201d Volozh said.\n\nWhile Yandex is building a platform of applications to work on its browser, it expects most revenue to continue to come from search rather than display ads or paid-for services.\n\nApple has blazed a trail selling applications, music and video through its iTunes store. But that market is only a fraction of the size of the tens of billions earned every year in search, Volozh said.\n\nYandex would not rule out deals to help its expansion abroad, he added.\n\n\u201cIt may be one of the models to buy somebody or partner with someone or just to build something from scratch,\u201d he said.\n\nThe key was to persuade consumers of the importance of maintaining choice and competition.\n\n\u201cWe have ended up with these platforms where you are gardened in ... you can\u2019t step out of it. This is completely contrary to the initial idea of the internet,\u201d Volozh said.",

        "body": "(Reuters) - At least seven brokerages cut their price targets on Google Inc\u2019s shares after the company missed Wall Street earnings expectations, but analysts said growing mobile advertising revenue points to better times ahead.\n\nThe earnings report, released hours ahead of schedule due to an error on Thursday, revealed slowing sales in Google\u2019s core Internet advertising business.\n\nThe quarterly earnings missed expectations for the second time in a year but analysts said the decline was a short-term trade-off as mobile advertising revenue becomes a bigger part of its business.\n\nChief Executive Larry Page, speaking on an earnings call, said that Google\u2019s mobile business, which includes app sales and advertising, was now generating revenue at an annualized run rate of $8 billion, up from about $2.5 billion last year.\n\n\u201cThis run-rate ... speaks to how GOOG has positioned itself to win regardless of platform,\u201d Nomura Equity Research\u2019s Brian Nowak wrote in a note, although he cut his price target on the stock to $840 from $900 because of the short-term outlook.\n\nGoogle shares closed down 8 percent at $694.37 on Thursday. The stock was up 1 percent at $700 in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nPiper Jaffray & Co, RBC Capital Markets, Raymond James, Robert W. Baird & Co, Susquehanna Financial Group, BMO Capital Markets and Evercore Partners also lowered their outlook on the Google stock by an average of $44.14.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays Capital, however, raised their price target by 4 percent to $780.\n\nIn a note titled \u201c3Q Results Disappointing but Not Alarming,\u201d Barclays analyst Anthony DiClemente said Google\u2019s revenue missed on slowing click volume growth, but also blamed the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.\n\n\u201cWe believe dislocation in shares creates a buying opportunity, and we like GOOG into 4Q, as we believe the company can benefit from ecommerce tailwinds and moderation in CPC (cost per click) declines on easier (comparables).\u201d\n\nFor the fourth consecutive quarter, Google reported a decline in average CPC, a critical metric that measures the price advertisers pay the company.\n\nAdvertisers on Google\u2019s network pay a smaller fee for mobile display ads compared to a similar ad on PCs.\n\nNet revenue growth at Google\u2019s main Internet business increased 17 percent year-over-year -- the first time growth in that business has fallen below 20 percent since 2009.\n\nGoogle finance chief Patrick Pichette stressed on the conference call that the revenue growth rate would have been higher if the impact of currency rates had been backed out.\n\n\u201cWe are incrementally more positive following the call given our belief that despite any near-term fluctuations from mobile monetization and FX, Google\u2019s franchise is intact and remains one of the most reliable growth stories on the Internet,\u201d Piper Jaffray\u2019s Gene Munster said.\n\nPersistent losses at Google\u2019s recently acquired cellphone business, Motorola Mobility, were further exacerbated by a faster-than-anticipated fall in revenue for that unit.\n\nRBC analyst Sean Kim said margins were likely impacted by Google\u2019s Nexus 7 tablet and higher-than-expected losses at Motorola Mobility Inc (MMI).\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we continue to expect somewhat elevated level of losses at MMI and some margin degradation due to Nexus 7,\u201d Kim said.\n\nGoogle launched Nexus 7, its first tablet, earlier this year to take on Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Kindle Fire and Apple Inc\u2019s iPad, but the low $199 price tag and related marketing costs weighed on margins.\n\n\u201cMarketing was higher primarily due to increased advertising for the Nexus 7 tablet,\u201d Raymond James\u2019 Aaron Kessler said.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s quarterly results fell well short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations after its core advertising business slowed, stunning investors accustomed to consistently rapid growth from the Internet giant and wiping more than 9 percent off its market value.\n\nThe disappointing numbers on Thursday came hours ahead of schedule in a rare instance of premature filing. Google blamed the misfire on an unauthorized filing by its financial printers, RR Donnelley & Sons Co, and later confirmed the numbers\u2019 accuracy.\n\nThe earnings report, which had not been expected until after the market close, revealed a weakening in Google\u2019s core Internet advertising business and persistent losses at its recently acquired cellphone business, Motorola Mobility.\n\nShares of Google, the world\u2019s No. 1 Internet search engine, finished Thursday\u2019s regular trading session down 8 percent at $695 after a brief trading halt. Some analysts said the inadvertent results release spurred confusion and exacerbated its stock price decline.\n\nGoogle executives maintained in a conference call on Thursday that the company\u2019s various businesses continued to benefit from healthy growth and that Google was well-positioned to capitalize on consumer\u2019s increasing use of mobile devices.\n\nChief Executive Larry Page, speaking on his first earnings call since an unspecified voice ailment sidelined him from public speaking in June, said that Google\u2019s mobile business was now generating revenue at an annualized run rate of $8 billion.\n\nPage acknowledged that mobile ad rates were below the rates that Google garners for ads that appear on its standard website. But he said the variety of Web-connected devices used by consumers is creating \u201ca huge new universe of opportunities for advertisers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re uniquely positioned to get through that transition and to really profit from it,\u201d Page said, citing Google\u2019s Android mobile software, the world\u2019s top operating system for smartphones by market share.\n\nGoogle, which has been struggling to turn around a Motorola Mobility hardware business it bought for $12.5 billion, reported a 20 percent dive in net income to $2.18 billion. Excluding certain items, it earned $9.03 a share, vastly underperforming the $10.65 analysts had expected, on average.\n\n\u201cWe have been saying this thing was ripe for a pullback. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re Google not being Google, but you still have some major issues,\u201d said BCG analyst Colin Gillis.\n\n\u201cClick prices declined for the fourth consecutive quarter after rising for eight consecutive quarters before then. That\u2019s a negative. This is the mobile problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other bit is the Motorola millstone had been ignored by the market, and - boom - now you\u2019ve got weak revenue from Motorola. When you acquire a business and you\u2019re about to whack all kinds of people and close offices, you know what happens to the employees? They take their eye off the ball. Sales are down,\u201d Gillis explained.\n\nNet revenue growth at Google\u2019s main Internet business increased 17 percent year-over-year, the first time growth in that business has fallen below 20 percent since 2009. Google Finance Chief Patrick Pichette stressed on the conference call that the revenue growth rate was higher if the impact of foreign currency exchange rates was backed out.\n\n\u201cIt was just too rapid a deceleration,\u201d said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. \u201cMany of the same underlying trends drive Facebook advertising.\u201d\n\nShares of Facebook Inc, which headed south shortly after Google\u2019s inadvertent filing, closed down 4.6 percent. Google\u2019s snafu recalled Facebook\u2019s debut, which was marred by technical glitches that also spooked traders and contributed to the stock\u2019s first-day decline.\n\nThe decline in Google\u2019s shares come after a three-month run-up in its stock, which reached an all-time high of $774.38 earlier this month.\n\nGoogle reported net revenue - excluding traffic acquisition costs - of $11.3 billion for the third quarter, below Wall Street\u2019s expectations for about $11.9 billion.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive quarter, the company reported a decline in average cost-per-click (CPC), a critical metric that denotes the price advertisers pay Google.\n\nAverage CPC declined 15 percent from a year ago and 3 percent from the second quarter of this year. Analysts say that Google, like many of its peers in the Internet industry, has been struggling to adapt to the rapid consumer uptake in mobile devices. Advertisers pay far less for ads on smartphones and tablets than for similar ads on desktop computers.\n\n\u201cThe core business seems to have slowed down pretty significantly, which is shocking,\u201d said B. Riley analyst Sameet Sinha. \u201cThe only conclusion I can look at is, search is happening more and more outside of Google, meaning people are searching more through apps than through Google search.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat could indicate a secular change, especially when it comes to ecommerce searches. The big fear has always been, what if people decide just to go straight to Amazon and do their searches? And potentially that\u2019s what could be happening.\u201d\n\nBut Ryan Jacob, chairman and chief investment officer of Jacob Funds, said he viewed Google\u2019s results as only \u201cminorly disappointing,\u201d with most of the weakness coming from Motorola as expected.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, by dropping an 8K in the middle of a trading day, people kind of shoot first, ask questions later,\u201d said Jacob, whose fund owns Google shares.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note that the Google results were \u201clight\u201d but not as bad as they appeared at \u201cfirst blush.\u201d\n\nGoogle, which recently overtook Microsoft Corp to become the second-largest U.S. technology company by capitalization, had been due to release its results after the market close.\n\nThe second paragraph of the press release merely read \u201cPending Larry quote,\u201d suggesting that space was reserved for comment from CEO Larry Page.\n\n\u201cEarlier this morning RR Donnelley, the financial printer, informed us that they had filed our draft 8K earnings statement without authorization,\u201d Google said in a statement. \u201cWe have ceased trading on NASDAQ while we work to finalize the document. Once it\u2019s finalized we will release our earnings, resume trading on NASDAQ and hold our earnings call as normal at 1:30 PM PT.\u201d\n\nShares of RR Donnelley, the U.S. printing services company, slid as much as 5 percent. They closed down 1 percent at $10.76.\n\nReed Kathrein, a plaintiff lawyer with Hagens Berman who sues companies on behalf of investors, said investors would not have a claim against either Google or RR Donnelley because the earnings disclosure was likely a mistake.\n\nHowever, Google could have a negligence claim against RR Donnelly to recover any additional costs it incurred in responding to the incident, Kathrein added.\n\n\u201cEveryone is trying to figure out if there\u2019s any legal issue with respect to RR Donnelley,\u201d said Michael Matousek, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc, which manages about $3 billion in San Antonio.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co handles thousands of securities filings a year for corporate clients in a routine process that is invisible to most investors. On Thursday Google and its shareholders found out just what happens when that process goes wrong.\n\nGoogle issued a statement blaming Donnelley, its filing agent, after the Internet search company\u2019s quarterly results were released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hours ahead of schedule.\n\nEarnings were far less than analysts expected and Google shares immediately plunged as much as 10.5 percent, knocking $26 billion off its market capitalization - the equivalent, as it happens, of about 13 R.R. Donnelleys.\n\nIt was quickly obvious that a mistake had been made -- the second paragraph of the filing said \u201cPENDING LARRY QUOTE\u201d instead of an actual quote from Google CEO Larry Page -- but it was not clear why.\n\nWithin minutes, though, an unknown prankster set up a \u201cPendingLarry\u201d Twitter feed to hypothesize what the missing quote might be. Among the highlights: \u201cMan, our privacy was WAY violated today.\u201d\n\nDonnelley shares lost more than 5 percent after Google started pointing the finger, though they recovered later in the day. The company did not respond to a call for comment, but issued a statement to CNBC in which it said it was investigating the circumstances of the release.\n\nBest known as a provider of printing services, Donnelley is also the top SEC filing agent in the country, handling more than 75,000 submissions this year as of mid-October, according to SECInfo.com.\n\nFiling agents like Donnelley take paper documents and convert them for submission to the SEC in the appropriate format. The company also owns the filing portal EDGAR Online.\n\nIt is far from the first time a company\u2019s earnings have somehow gotten out early.\n\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, inadvertent releases - usually by a misplaced release on a website - plagued companies like Walt Disney Co and Microsoft Corp.\n\nThe common thread in all of those cases is that investors who are not in the right place at the right time to see the news may suffer for it.\n\n\u201cSome who didn\u2019t get a chance to sell will try to, and others will be looking for bargains. I\u2018m sure a lot of Google owners were caught off guard,\u201d said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\nAfter the first question of \u201cwho goofed?\u201d was sorted out Thursday afternoon, the second one being asked by investors was \u201ccan we sue?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is trying to figure out if there\u2019s any legal issue with respect to R.R. Donnelley. Google is halted, Donnelley is down big-time on the news since they\u2019re allegedly not supposed to have released the information,\u201d said Michael Matousek, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors in San Antonio.\n\nBut one plaintiffs lawyer who sues companies on behalf of investors said shareholders would not have a claim against either Google or R.R. Donnelley because the earnings disclosure was likely a mistake.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fraudulent intent here,\u201d said Reed Kathrein with Hagens Berman.\n\nR.R. Donnelley may not be entirely off the hook with Google, however. The company could have a negligence claim to recover any additional costs it incurred in responding to the incident, Kathrein said.\n\nAny potential damages against R.R. Donnelley could be limited, though, by the contract between the two companies.\n\nLate Thursday, Google filed an amended press release with the missing quote and a confirmation that the figures in the original were accurate.\n\nR.R. Donnelley shares were up 2 cents at $10.87 in late trading. Google was down 8.1 percent to $693.94 after trading resumed.",
