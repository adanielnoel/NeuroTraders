        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc, the new holding company for Google, introduced its first share buyback and beat Wall Street\u2019s profit forecast on Thursday, helped by solid progress in mobile and video advertising, sending the stock to its highest-ever level in after-hours trading.\n\nRevenue and profit well above analysts\u2019 average forecasts, along with the unexpected buyback, was welcomed by Wall Street, which is now betting on further growth.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in a great position in the overall advertising space, whether it\u2019s search, display or mobile,\u201d said Kerry Rice, a Needham & Co analyst. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the right program to continue to grow at a solid pace and be dominant in those spaces.\u201d\n\nThe results come at a pivotal time for the company as it navigates the transition from desktop to mobile, where ads are generally less profitable, while facing growing competition from rivals like Facebook Inc.\n\nAt the same time, it is moving into a new corporate structure that will put more visibility on parts of Alphabet such as its secretive research arm, Google X. Next quarter will be the first in which it reports results under that structure.\n\nCompany executives touted strength in mobile search for the strong results. \u201cSearch traffic on mobile phones have now surpassed desktop traffic worldwide,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google Inc.\n\nShares of Alphabet rose almost 9 percent in after-hours trading to $741, easily a record. At that level, the company\u2019s market value would be around $500 billion, making it the second-most valuable company in the S&P 500 after Apple Inc.\n\nOn a strong day for technology companies, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp shares also rose sharply after hours, following better-than-expected results.\n\n\u201cThey seem to have a better hold on mobile and are navigating the transition to mobile usage better than expected,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.\n\nStill, Cakmak questioned how Google\u2019s internet-based business will fare in the long term in an app-based world. \u201cTheir primary strength in apps is YouTube and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors have been pressing the company to return more of its $72 billion cash pile, but the announcement that Alphabet would buy back up to $5.09 billion of its Class C shares came as a surprise.\n\nMature technology companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp have come under intense pressure in recent years to give back more cash to investors.\n\nThird-quarter revenue rose 13 percent to $18.68 billion, above the $18.53 billion that Wall Street expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned $7.35 per share, up 17.6 percent from the year before. That was ahead of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $7.21 per share.\n\nExpenses rose 9.1 percent to $13.97 billion but were 74.7 percent of total revenue, compared to 77.4 percent in the same quarter last year, reflecting new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat\u2019s tight rein on spending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strong top and bottom line results,\u201d said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see not only expense control - which is the new CFO - but also upside on the top line.\u201d\n\nThe company said the number of paid clicks, in which advertisers pay only if a user clicks on the ad, rose 23 percent, compared to an 18 percent increase in the previous quarter.\n\nCost-per-click, or the average price of online ads, fell 11 percent in the quarter. (bit.ly/1M8LA5l)\n\n\u201cOur value proposition to markets of all sizes is simple. Google can help you show the right ads to the right people at the right moment,\u201d Pichai said.\n\nUnder the Alphabet structure, search, advertising, maps, YouTube and Android will remain part of Google.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s businesses will include connected home products maker Nest, venture capital arm Google Ventures, Google X, the company\u2019s secretive research arm, and Google Capital, which invests in larger tech companies.",

        "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Google says European media firms, often the search giant\u2019s harshest industry critics, share a common threat because a surge in ad-blocking technology is a threat to all businesses dependent on advertising.\n\nCarlo d\u2018Asaro Biondo, Google\u2019s president for EMEA strategic relationships, told a media conference in Munich on Thursday that consumers \u201chate bad ads\u201d, and that Google and content creators must do more to protect consumers from obtrusive ads.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that ad blockers that block all ads are throwing the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d d\u2018Asaro Biondo said, according to prepared comments for the conference. \u201cWe need to work together to create a standard for better ads online.\u201d\n\nHis comments came as part of a six-month charm offensive by Google - its Digital News Initiative - to win over newspaper publishers with collaboration on technology, digital newsroom training and funding for small-scale media innovation projects.\n\nOver the past decade, the media industry has often accused Google of making money at its expense by making its content freely available via Google News, YouTube and other services to drive audiences to view ads on Google sites instead.\n\nWhile critics have derided Google\u2019s Digital News Initiative as offering token handouts to the media industry, some 100 European publishers have signed up to the project since April, d\u2018Asaro Biondo said, up from just 11 initial partners.\n\nHe said those taking part are free to choose how much they participate and do not need to buy into Google\u2019s \u201cworldview\u201d.\n\nEurope\u2019s online advertising market grew to 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in 2014, according to industry figures.\n\nThis is the lifeblood of publishers and other content creators and Google aims to make it easier for news organizations to get their share, d\u2018Asaro Biondo said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Google announced a service it calls Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) designed to speed the loading of news pages in mobile phone browsers, potentially reducing reader complaints about ads slowing down page retrievals. AMP will begin running in Google Search early in 2016, he said.\n\nGoogle gets about 90 percent of its revenue from ads.\n\nGermany\u2019s biggest newspaper publisher Axel Springer last week banned readers who use ad blockers from its Bild tabloid website, stepping up a fight by publishers to stop online advertising revenues being eroded.\n\nSome 200 million people used ad blockers last year, up 40 percent from a year earlier, resulting in $22 billion in lost advertising revenue, according to a recent study by Adobe and PageFair, an anti ad-blocking technology company.",

        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon are grappling happily with maturity. The $450 billion holding company for Google is returning lots more money to shareholders. The $260 billion internet mega-retailer delivered profits. Both operations are growing so fast, and throwing off so much cash, that they can act as responsible stewards of capital while still chasing the next big thing.\n\nThird-quarter results showed both firms overcoming challenges from rivals. Despite consumers spending more time on Facebook, and Apple rolling out mobile ad blockers, Alphabet managed to increase revenue by 13 percent. While advertisers paid 11 percent less per click, the number of paid clicks rose 23 percent. The waters of internet advertising are rising faster than rivals can divert them, and that\u2019s carrying Alphabet higher.\n\nMoreover, newish finance chief Ruth Porat showed her influence on sensible capital allocation, with the company announcing its first big buyback. Of course, Alphabet hasn\u2019t settled down entirely. It is still pursuing moon shots from robotics to bioinformatics with vigor. It hasn\u2019t given up its nerdy humor either \u2013 the buyback figure represents the square root of 26, which is the number of letters in the alphabet. None of this will dent the balance sheet. Alphabet can invest and repurchase, as its cash hoard has increased by $10 billion over the past year to $73 billion.\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t nearly as profitable. But it is in the black, and the company is growing far faster: 23 percent at the top line in the quarter. Its retail operations are chugging along, and the company expects a blockbuster holiday season. But the real gem is now its Web Services division, which provides on-demand computing. It\u2019s expanding at more than 75 percent per annum. And margins, as the company defines them, are now at 25 percent and rising.\n\nTrue, it\u2019s hard to nail down the profitability of this business. Amazon strips out various costs such as stock-based compensation. But the company can easily afford to take on all comers. Amazon\u2019s operations overall threw off $2.6 billion of cash in the quarter, and that figure is nearly 50 percent higher than it was a year ago.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon are sharing some of the benefits of maturity with their shareholders, but they aren\u2019t giving up the exciting perks of youth.",
