        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google is asking for sanctions against Oracle Corp after one of the software developer\u2019s lawyers discussed confidential details about the search giant\u2019s relationship with Apple Inc at a court hearing earlier this month.\n\nOracle\u2019s lawyer disclosed sensitive financial information regarding the relationship along with confidential information about Google\u2019s finances, which within days became headline news, Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said in a letter on Wednesday to U.S. District Judge William Alsup and U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu.\n\nIn its letter Google requested permission to file a motion seeking sanctions, for a finding of contempt, and asked that Oracle\u2019s lawyer not have further access to its confidential information or confidential information of a third party.\n\nThe disclosure violated a protective order and led to an article by Bloomberg that \u201copened the floodgates\u201d to more stories, including by Reuters, regarding the closely held information, the letter said.\n\n\u201cThe severe potential consequences of public disclosure quickly became reality, particularly given the surprising nature of the disclosure,\u201d according to the letter.\n\nOracle was not immediately available to comment on the letter.\n\nCiting a transcript of court proceedings related to a copyright lawsuit filed by Oracle against the search giant, Bloomberg reported Google paid Apple $1 billion in 2014 to keep its search bar on the iPhone.\n\nGoogle gives Apple a percentage of revenue generated through the iPhone but details of the tie-up have never been made public.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Android operating system has generated revenue of about $31 billion and a profit of $22 billion since its release, Oracle\u2019s lawyer said at the hearing.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Oracle has accused Google of not paying for the use of Java software for Android devices.\n\nOracle is seeking royalties for Google\u2019s use of some Java language. Google argues it should be able to use Java without paying a fee.",

        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron came under increasing pressure on Wednesday over a back tax deal agreed by Internet group Google that was hailed by his finance minister as a major success but dismissed as \u201cderisory\u201d by the opposition Labour Party.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Cameron to defend the deal, which he said represented a tax rate of just 3 percent on 6 billion pounds ($8.5 billion) of profits that Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, has earned in Britain since 2005.\n\n\u201cWhy is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary small businesses and self-employed workers?\u201d, he asked the prime minister in his weekly parliamentary question session.\n\nCameron did not comment on the 130 million-pound settlement, which covers 2005 to 2015 and which brings the company\u2019s total tax bill to around 200 million pounds for the period, during which it had UK revenues of around 24 billion pounds.\n\nHowever, he said he had been genuinely angry over Google\u2019s failure to pay much tax, adding that this largely occurred when Labour was in power from 1997 to 2010.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done more on tax evasion and tax avoidance than Labour ever did,\u201d he said.\n\nFinance minister George Osborne, seen as a possible successor to Cameron, has said the settlement was \u201ca victory for the action we\u2019ve taken\u201d against corporate profit-shifting.\n\nGoogle has said it paid all the tax that was due. It says it declares little profit in the UK because most of its profits are derived from innovations invented in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe pay tax based on the value added by the economic activity of our staff here,\u201d a Google spokesman said.\n\nProfits from European sales are reported in Bermuda, which has a zero tax rate.\n\nDomestic media have roundly criticized the tax deal and even vociferous opponents of Corbyn such as the tabloid Sun have backed Labour on the issue.\n\nRupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc[NWSNA.UL], criticized the deal, tweeting that \u201cGoogle et al broke no tax laws. Now paying token amounts for p r purposes. Won\u2019t work. Need strong new laws to pay like the rest of us.\u201d\n\nHis tweets set off a Twitter storm, with others criticizing Murdoch for meetings with the Conservatives, wondering about the taxes paid by Murdoch\u2019s companies, and even referring to some of the reporting tactics at his papers.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you get some journalists on this instead of hacking celebrities\u2019 phones and the like,\u201d tweeted a user under the handle @tradercoach.\n\nTax avoidance has become a hot political issue in Britain, where people question whether the burden of fixing the public finances has been fairly shared.\n\nSince the deal was announced on Friday, Labour has called for an investigation by the National Audit Office, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has said it will investigate the deal and the Treasury Committee said it would examine the whole corporate tax system.\n\nGoogle said it was prepared to testify at the PAC hearing, the date for which has yet to be confirmed.",
