        "body": "(Reuters) - How much is Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) spending on \u201cmoonshots\u201d \u2013 self-driving cars, glucose-monitoring contact lenses, Internet balloons and other ambitious projects?\n\nInvestors will get their long-awaited answer when Alphabet reports fourth-quarter results after markets close on Monday.\n\nThe report will be the first time Alphabet will break out results for what it calls \u201cOther Bets,\u201d which includes Google Fiber; smart home accessory maker Nest Labs and the secretive \u201cX\u201d, home to the self-driving cars project.\n\nThe results will also show how successful Google was in targeting ads at a fast-growing number of mobile users, especially after Facebook Inc\u2019s (FB.O) stellar report.\n\nA strong report could boost the stock enough for Alphabet to surpass Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the most valuable company in the world.\n\n\u201cFor the first time they (Alphabet) have a real catalyst to the stock, aside from a standard beat-and-raise,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc.\n\nThe market has wanted four things from Alphabet: consistent revenue growth, margin stabilization, greater disclosure and share buybacks, and they will get all of them this quarter, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.\n\nThe reading may not be pretty.\n\nA Raymond James survey showed that 72 percent of investors expect \u201cOther Bets\u201d lost more than $1.5 billion in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe believe revenues from Other Bets will be fairly immaterial for Alphabet given the early stages of most of these businesses,\u201d Raymond James analysts wrote in a note.\n\nTo be sure, almost all of Alphabet\u2019s revenue comes from its Google unit.\n\nThe unit houses its Internet and related businesses such as search, ads, maps, YouTube and Android as well as hardware products such as its Chromebooks.\n\nGoogle\u2019s revenue has been bolstered by its efforts to drive sales from its mobile and video advertising as well as Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat\u2019s increased discipline on expenses.\n\nAd sales to mobile users is going to be the main driver to Google\u2019s results, just as it was at Facebook.\n\nAnalysts on average are expecting Alphabet\u2019s profit to rise to $8.10 per share from $6.88 and revenue to rise 14.7 percent to $20.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nAlphabet shares closed at $761.35 on Friday, valuing the company at about $517 billion, 4.4 percent shy of Apple\u2019s valuation of about $540 billion.",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc easily beat Wall Street\u2019s quarterly profit forecasts on Monday, helped by strong mobile advertising sales, sending the shares of Google\u2019s parent higher in after-hours trading to surpass Apple Inc as the most valuable U.S. company.\n\nFor the first time, the company disclosed the profitability of Google\u2019s search engine and its other online services, and how much it is spending on ambitious technology projects such as self-driving cars.\n\nThe numbers were lapped up by investors, who saw room for growth in Google\u2019s traditional business, and were relieved to see that spending on new projects it calls \u2018Other Bets\u2019 was not as lavish as some had feared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty interesting that 80 percent of YouTube views come from outside of the United States. I didn\u2019t think it would be that high,\u201d said Kevin Kelly, managing partner at Recon Capital. \u201cIt demonstrates that the value of YouTube can continue to be extracted,\u201d he said.\n\nThe operating profit margin for its Google unit was 31.9 percent in the most recent quarter, compared to 25 percent for Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet spent $869 million on capital expenditures for the Other Bets in 2015, up from $501 million in 2014. It has not made any projections about if or when those bets cumulatively would become profitable.\n\n\u201cAs long as the core business continues to operate well with accelerated revenue... investment in those businesses can continue,\u201d said Ronald Josey of JMP Securities.\n\nThe company said consolidated revenue jumped 17.8 percent to $21.33 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $18.10 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $20.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nRevenue for Other Bets was $151 million, up 29.8 percent from $106 million in the same quarter last year, primarily from its smart-home monitoring unit Nest, Google Fiber, which provides high-speed Internet access, and its life sciences business Verily.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $8.67 per share handily beat analysts\u2019 average estimate of $8.10 per share.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attributed the strong earnings to \u201cincreased use of mobile search by consumers,\u201d as well as \u201congoing momentum\u201d in YouTube and programmatic advertising, referring to the automatic buying of ads.\n\nKelly at Recon Capital said he would not be surprised if YouTube saw a surge in advertising revenues beyond the 17 percent increase it saw during the 2015 fiscal year.\n\nTotal operating losses on the Other Bets \u2013 which include glucose-monitoring contact lenses and Internet balloons - increased to $3.57 billion in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Google unit houses its Internet and related businesses such as search, ads, maps, YouTube and Android as well as hardware products such as its low-cost Chromebook laptops.\n\nGoogle Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on the call that its Gmail service crossed one billion monthly active users last quarter, joining Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube and Google Play in topping that mark.\n\nHe also touted the company\u2019s performance during the holiday shopping season, saying that programmatic video impressions doubled this season compared to last, and that 60 percent of them came from mobile devices.\n\nBut Porat, without providing figures, said the company planned to accelerate capital expenditures in 2016 compared to the previous year.\n\nGoogle\u2019s shares rose almost 5 percent in after-hours trading. Alphabet\u2019s combined share classes were worth $549 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $534 billion.\n\nAlphabet will officially overtake Apple in market value if both companies\u2019 shares open around current levels on Tuesday.\n\nGoogle\u2019s advertising revenue increased nearly 17 percent to $19.08 billion, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 31 percent, the company said. Analysts had expected paid clicks to increase 21.8 percent.\n\nAdvertisers pay Google only if someone clicks on their ad.\n\nNet income in the fourth quarter rose to $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, from $4.68 billion, or $6.79 per share. (bit.ly/1WY8V19)\n\nAdjusted earnings of $8.67 per share excluded certain one-time items.",

Call options are typically bought by investors who believe a stock will rise in value and puts are generally used to hedge against a dip.\n\n\u201cIt does appear that there is some defensive positioning going into the announcement,\u201d said Dan Deming, managing director at KKM Financial in Chicago.\n\nAlphabet is the last of the group of high-growth tech stocks including Facebook Inc (FB.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), that together make up the \u201cFANG\u201d group, to report earnings this quarter.\n\nShares of two of this group have had large post-earnings moves. Amazon shares fell 7.6 percent on the day after it reported results, while Facebook shares jumped by twice as much.\n\nTraders\u2019 expectation for a large near-term move in Alphabet shares is high.

Over the last eight earnings reports, the average one-day move after reporting is 5.5 percent.\n\nOn Monday, put contracts betting on Google class A shares falling below $660 by Friday, down about 14 percent from the current price, was the busiest option with 1,440 contracts traded.\n\nOn the other hand, calls on the shares climbing to $900, up 17 percent by Friday were also busy, with 1,100 contracts traded.",
