        "body": "(Reuters) - Google Inc reported higher quarterly revenue and profit as rising online ad volume offset a hit from the strong dollar, sending the Internet company\u2019s shares higher in after-hours trading.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s No. 1 Internet search engine rose after the results were released, climbing 3.5 percent on Thursday to $577.\n\nWhile revenue and profit missed the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, many investors had been bracing for a weaker report, said BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis.\n\nThe company has faced challenges in mobile advertising and is running up more expenses as it invests in new businesses.\n\n\u201cThe concern was that the first quarter results could have been much worse,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain degree of relief rally happening.\u201d\n\nRevenue for the quarter that ended in March rose 12 percent to $17.26 billion, from $15.42 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $17.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe rising dollar took a toll on results at Google, which generates about half of its revenue overseas.\n\n\u201dExcluding the net impact of foreign currency headwinds, revenue grew a healthy 17 percent year on year,\u201d Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said in a statement.\n\nThe number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 13 percent, while the average price of online ads, or \u201ccost per click,\u201d declined 7 percent.\n\nGoogle\u2019s ad revenue has been pressured as more consumers access its online services on mobiles devices such as smartphones and tablets, where ad rates are typically lower.\n\nIn a conference call, Pichette highlighted mobile ads as a key source of revenue growth during the quarter. \u201cWe are experiencing real strength in mobile search,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contribution of ad revenue from video platform YouTube \u201ccontinues to grow at a strong rate year-over year,\u201d he added. Brands are embracing YouTube\u2019s TrueView service, where advertisers pay only when users opt not to skip an ad, he said.\n\nGoogle's advertising sales in the first quarter rose 11 percent to $15.51 billion. (bit.ly/1OLAPb8)\n\nThe company, under increasing competition for mobile ad dollars from rivals such as Facebook Inc, tweaked its algorithm for mobile searches on Tuesday to favor sites that look good on smartphone screens. (bit.ly/1yMzbno)\n\nEarlier this month, the European Union accused Google of abusing its dominance of Internet searches to push its own products. [ID: nL5N0XC2W0]\n\nNet income rose to $3.59 billion, or $5.20 per share, from $3.45 billion, or $5.04 per share.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $6.57 per share, just missing analysts\u2019 forecast of $6.60.",
