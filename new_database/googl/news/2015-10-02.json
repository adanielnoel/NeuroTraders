        "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s antitrust chief dismissed on Friday accusations of anti-U.S. bias over her decision to go after Google (GOOGL.O) for abusing its Internet search dominance and Apple (AAPL.O) over an Irish tax deal, saying such talk was a fallacy.\n\nEuropean Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s robust defense of her actions came after she was criticized in the U.S. media for a spate of cases opened over the past year against U.S. giants such as Google, Apple, Amazon (AMZN.O) and Starbucks (SBUX.O).\n\nSome critics have accused EU regulators of seeking to protect European companies from U.S. competitors.\n\nVestager rejected the criticism, saying the nationality of companies played no role in her assessment.\n\n\u201cSome claim that our cases involving Internet giants such as Apple or Google are evidence of bias. Well, that is a fallacy,\u201d she said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the Foreign Policy Association in New York.\n\n\u201cYes, U.S. companies are often involved when we investigate the digital industry. But you will also see many Japanese firms in our car-part cartel cases,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said data on cartel fines and mergers also showed no geographic bias.\n\nThe European Commission is now studying Google\u2019s response to antitrust charges of favoring its Google Shopping service over rivals. It is also investigating the company\u2019s popular Android operating system for smartphones.\n\nAmazon is in the EU\u2019s crosshairs for a Luxembourg tax deal and Starbucks for a Dutch tax arrangement.",
