        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Employees suing Apple, Google and two other tech companies over hiring practices said an appeals court should not approve a $324.5 million settlement in the case, according to a court filing on Tuesday.\n\nPlaintiff workers accused Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe in a 2011 lawsuit of conspiring to avoid poaching each other\u2019s employees. The companies agreed to a $324.5 million settlement earlier this year.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California then rejected the proposed class action settlement, saying the amount was too low. The companies appealed last month, saying she committed \u201cclear legal error.\u201d\n\nIn the filing on Tuesday, the workers said that although they believed the $324.5 million deal originally warranted approval, the judge had the proper authority to reject it and they would \u201cdefer to (Koh\u2018s) sound judgment about how best to oversee this litigation.\u201d\n\nAn Intel spokesman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman. Representatives for Google and Adobe could not immediately be reached.\n\nTech employees alleged that the conspiracy limited their job mobility and, as a result, kept a lid on salaries.\n\nThe case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity of a glimpse into the world of some of the United States\u2019 elite tech firms.\n\nPlaintiffs based their allegations of conspiracy largely on emails circulated among Apple\u2019s late co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt, and some of their rivals.\n\nIn rejecting the proposed settlement, Koh repeatedly referred to a related deal last year involving Disney and Intuit. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less in the latest agreement compared with the one involving Disney, Koh wrote.\n\nTo match the earlier settlement, the latest deal \u201cwould need to total at least $380 million,\u201d Koh wrote.\n\nIn the filing on Tuesday, the plaintiffs argued that the $324.5 million deal \u201cceased to exist\u201d the moment Koh rejected it, by virtue of the settlement terms negotiated by both sides. The companies \u201cshould not complain about this state of affairs, given that it is their own doing,\u201d attorneys for the employees wrote.\n\nThe case is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California 11-cv-2509.",

        "body": "BERLIN, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s economy minister warned during a debate with Google chairman Eric Schmidt on Tuesday that the tech giant\u2019s dominant position might undermine democratic rights and hamper competition, adding that stricter regulation is needed.\n\n\u201cI admire Google, but I also admire an engineer who is able to build a car - and nevertheless I am in favour of road traffic rules,\u201d said Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat who is also deputy to conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany\u2019s broad governing coalition.\n\nIn Germany, concerns over Google\u2019s market power have mingled with wider fears of U.S. cyber espionage since the revelations of mass U.S. snooping on German citizens last year.\n\nThe digital sphere needs more ground rules, Gabriel said, and Germany would shortly send proposals to the new European Commission on how to address this.\n\nLast May Gabriel suggested firms like Google should be broken up if they were abusing dominant market positions.\n\nSchmidt responded that critics overstated Google\u2019s market power and that one also should look at its U.S. rivals like Facebook or Amazon.\n\n\u201cGoogle is not the only site people use,\u201d he said.\n\nThe California-based company accounts for more than 80 percent of the European Internet search market and more than 90 percent of that in Germany.\n\nGoogle is the target of a European antitrust investigation into its Internet search engine. E.U. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last month the company may face further scrutiny over its other services following several complaints.\n\nAdding to Google\u2019s woes, the European Union\u2019s top court in May reinforced Europeans\u2019 \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d by ruling that search engines must remove results on request if the information was \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant\u201d.
