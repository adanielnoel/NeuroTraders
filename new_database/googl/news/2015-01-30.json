        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc plans to keep making ambitious and costly bets on futuristic products, even if it means shelving some of its most beloved projects.\n\nThe Internet search company acknowledged for the first time on Thursday major problems with its Google Glass wearable computer, noting that it was time for a \u201cpause\u201d and a strategy \u201creset.\u201d\n\nThe comments by Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette during Thursday\u2019s quarterly results conference call struck a decidedly different tone from Google\u2019s talk earlier this month of Glass \u201cgraduating\u201d from the company\u2019s labs into a separate division.\n\nPichette\u2019s admission of Glass\u2019 failings was particularly noteworthy given that the product has been long championed by Google co-founder Sergey Brin.\n\nAs growth in Google\u2019s main search advertising business slows, the company needs to reassure investors it can make clear and sober investment decisions, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to make the point that they\u2019re investing in areas that produce results,\u201d said Colin Gillis, a BGC Partners analyst.\n\n\u201cYou want them to be iterating. But you want them to shut things down things that aren\u2019t working. Don\u2019t throw money into dead holes.\u201d\n\nWhen Google co-founder Larry Page returned to the chief executive role in 2011 he undertook a series of \u201cspring cleanings,\u201d publicly pulling the plug on underperforming projects such as online encyclopedia Knol and a service that let consumers monitor their home energy consumption.\n\nUnder Page\u2019s tenure, Google is spending big on a variety of projects such as self-driving cars, solar-powered balloons that deliver Internet access, robotics and healthcare. Many of these projects are unlikely to deliver a payoff for years, if at all.\n\nCFO Pichette made it clear on Thursday that the 18 percent revenue growth from Google\u2019s websites during the fourth quarter gives the company \u201clicense\u201d to continue investing in long-term projects.\n\nBut he cited the differing fates of two high-profile projects to show Wall Street that Google remained disciplined in its spending.\n\nGoogle Fiber, a high-speed Internet access service which launched in Kansas City in 2012, recently announced plans to expand to four additional cities - a sign of success.\n\nGlass, by contrast, is a project that has not been able to \u201chit its hurdles\u201d despite its great promise, Pichette explained. Google halted consumer sales of Glass earlier this month, but said it would continue to sell the product to businesses.\n\n\u201cMaybe that was the message they\u2019re giving, that even if it\u2019s one of our pet projects, we are not afraid to come out and just kill it,\u201d said B. Riley & Co analyst Sameet Sinha.",
