It failed to comply with that decision and was subsequently fined 899 million euros. In total, its battle with the EU in several other investigations cost it more than 2.2 billion euros in penalties.\n\nIn an oblique reference to Microsoft, which faced nearly two decades of legal scrutiny for antitrust violations, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told a 2011 U.S. Senate hearing: \u201cWe get it. By that I mean, we get the lessons of our corporate predecessors.\u201d\n\nBut Google has much to learn, said Stephen Kinsella at law firm Sidley Austin, who advises Google complainant and UK online shopping comparison website Kelkoo.\n\n\u201cYears ago Google said they wouldn\u2019t make the mistakes that Microsoft did. Instead they made all of them and came up with a few of their own. The public statements yesterday show they still don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle said on Tuesday it disagreed with the EU\u2019s findings that it had abused its dominant position and was considering an appeal. It said it looked forward to continuing to make its case.\n\n\u201cThe real danger for Google is to enter into a prolonged battle with the Commission on whether what it has done is sufficient to comply with its decision. It could be quite expensive for Google in the end. This is not the end of the story,\u201d Berrisch said.\n\nUnderlining Google\u2019s task, the Commission on Wednesday published a tender for technical expertise to assist it with the case. The five-year contract is worth 10 million euros and can be renewed.\n\nSo far, investors have given Google the benefit of the doubt, with Alphabet ranking just behind Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable stock with a $666 billion market capitalisation. But they are taking note.\n\n\u201cThe real concern is whether the Commission will manage to force Google to change its business model, its algorithms in a way that could be detrimental to the business,\u201d said Wesley Lebeau, fund manager at CPR Asset Management, an Amundi company.\n\n\u201cSearch engine is still about 60 percent of Alphabet\u2019s valuation so that is a big deal, even though the drivers for future growth are YouTube and all the Alphabet companies -- Waymo, NEST, Verily,\u201d he said.\n\nTech titans have benefited so far from the perception that they bring benefits to society, said Freddie Lait, founder at Latitude Investment Management.\n\n\u201cBut there is a small chance that, if the shine wears off and you have more of these terrorist videos...and the fine is a huge fine, which sent a message to consumers that there\u2019s been wrongdoing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the shine comes off, the claws are out from regulators and governments to try and get their pound of flesh out of all of the big tech companies.\u201d ($1 = 0.8790 euros) (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in Frankfurt, Simon Jessop and Sophie Sassard in London)",
