        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday asked chief executives from companies representing the two sides of the net neutrality debate, including Alphabet, Facebook, AT&T and Verizon, to testify at a Sept. 7 hearing.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering tossing out 2015 Obama administration net neutrality rules that reclassified internet service like a public utility. The current rules bar providers from blocking or slowing websites, or allowing websites to pay for \u201cfast lanes\u201d over competitors.\n\nInternet providers and major tech companies have been sharply divided over the rules. Many internet providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while websites say the Obama era rules are critical to preserving the open internet.\n\nThe outcome of the debate could have a major impact on the future of the internet economy and potentially profits of the companies involved.\n\nOther chief executives asked to testify include the heads of Comcast Corp, Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc.\n\nSeveral companies said they were reviewing the letter but none immediately said if they will testify.\n\nComcast said it welcomed the hearing and \u201cbelieves the best way to stop the regulatory ping-pong on this important issue is for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201dA strong consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that it\u2019s time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet,\u201d said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican, who chairs the committee. \u201cThe time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the committee want Republicans to invite small businesses and consumers, not just the CEOs from some of the \u201clargest corporations in the world with a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion,\u201d said a statement from Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Doyle, both Democrats. Democrats have so far refused to work with Republicans on internet legislation.\n\nA group representing major technology firms last week urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to web content or offering paid \u201cfast lanes.\u201d\n\nMajor internet service have urged the FCC, however, to reverse the rules, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access.\n\nIn May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration\u2019s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities.\n\nThe FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers\u2019 ability to block, throttle or offer \u201cpaid prioritization,\u201d and, if so, whether it should keep any regulations in place.\n\nMore than 12 million public comments have been filed on the proposal.\n\nThe Internet Association, a group representing Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc, said last week it was \u201copen to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.\u201d",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc reported a 21 percent jump in quarterly revenue on Monday, maintaining a growth rate that is rarely seen among companies its size and suggesting the big sales gains enjoyed recently by the other Internet firms are not done yet.\n\nAlphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, said it made $3.5 billion in net income on sales of $26 billion. The profit would have been much larger but for a record $2.7 billion European Union antitrust fine.\n\nStill, the company noted that costs were rising faster than sales and warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices.\n\nThe squeeze on expected future profit appeared to weigh on Alphabet\u2019s share price, which fell about 3 percent to $967 after the bell. Shares had closed up in regular trading and have gained 26 percent for the year.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s cost of revenue, a measure of how much money the company must spend to keep its platforms running before added costs such as research, rose 28 percent, well above the growth in revenue itself.\n\nThe rising costs, including what Google pays to drive traffic to its search engine, hurt operating margins more than most people had expected, said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management.\n\n\u201cThis could be problematic going forward,\u201d Kass said.\n\nAlphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, asked about margins during a conference call with analysts, said the company was focused on getting bigger.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve often said, we\u2019re focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins,\u201d she said.\n\nIncreasing costs, Porat added, are a result of more money going into high-growth products that she said would create value for shareholders.\n\nWith its latest profits, Alphabet reported $15.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and another $79 billion in marketable securities.\n\nAlphabet and social media rival Facebook Inc, which together dominate the online ad market, compete for advertising dollars.\n\nThis year, Google is expected to have $73.75 billion in net digital ad revenue worldwide while Facebook is expected to take in $36.29 billion, according to research firm eMarketer. Together they will have about 49 percent of the market, eMarketer said.\n\nFacebook is due to report earnings on Wednesday.\n\nThe technology sector has led a big rally in U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 information technology index is up 23.1 percent this year, compared with a 10.4 percent rise in the S&P 500.\n\nAntitrust risk has shadowed Google for years, and antitrust enforcers in the European Union last month fined Google 2.42 billion euro ($2.7 billion) for favoring its own shopping service.\n\nThe fine came in the first of three EU probes of Google\u2019s dominance in searches and smartphone operating systems, and analysts are going to monitor the downside closely, said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones.\n\n\u201cIt is not so much the money or the fine itself,\u201d Olson said, but \u201cquestions linger about what impact that could have on Google\u2019s Europe business, and they did not really comment on that.\u201d\n\nU.S. antitrust enforcers thus far have chosen not to follow Europe\u2019s lead.\n\nIf not for the fine, Alphabet said that earnings per share would have been $8.90 in the second quarter, compared with $7 a year earlier. With the fine, Alphabet reported earnings per share of $5.01, beating an average estimate of $4.49.\n\nSundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, said in response to an analyst question during Monday\u2019s call that Google would fight to continue bundling its Android operating system with popular smartphone apps such as Google Maps -- a practice the EU antitrust officials are investigating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very open market, open ecosystem, and it works well for everyone, and I expect that to continue,\u201d Pichai said, adding that billions of people use Google products.\n\nPichai was also appointed to the Alphabet board of directors on Monday.\n\nRevenue from other Google products, a category that includes the Pixel smartphone, the Play Store and Google\u2019s cloud business, rose 42.3 percent to $3.09 billion. Alphabet competes heavily in the fast-growing cloud business with tech companies Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp.\n\nLosses from other Alphabet units - an array of businesses known as \u201cother bets\u201d that includes the Waymo self-driving car company, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily - narrowed to $772 million from $855 million a year earlier.",

        "body": "(Reuters) - There are very few things that make Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) investors unhappy. A rising TAC - the cost of driving traffic to its site - is one of them.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet, which has enjoyed revenue growth rate of over 20 percent for the past five quarters, said on Monday that TAC, or traffic acquisition costs, jumped 28 percent to $5.09 billion in the second quarter.\n\nThat is the highest percentage increase in TAC in nine years and analysts said they expect it to continue to weigh on margins even as the company\u2019s fundamentals remain strong.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares, which have surged 26 percent this year, slipped 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday.\n\nGoogle relies heavily on partners such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which has made Google the default search engine on the iPhone. It also pays websites to run ads.\n\n\u201cThe company continues to cite mobile and programmatic as drivers of overall increases in TAC, which we believe will likely continue to increase in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note.\n\nThe company has warned that spending on traffic acquisition is expected to keep rising as a shift to mobile advertising continues and programmatic advertising - in which ads are bought, sold and displayed by automated systems - becomes more important.\n\nTraffic acquisition costs were 22 percent of advertising revenue in the second quarter. Net ad revenue rose 16 percent, compared with 18 percent last quarter.\n\nCanaccord Genuity said it expects TAC to jump to $21.07 billion in 2017, 25 percent higher than last year. It had risen 17 percent in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe light net ad revenue coupled with the recent run-up in GOOG\u2019s share price are likely to cause a pullback,\u201d Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice said.\n\nDespite concerns about TAC, most analysts remained upbeat about the company\u2019s potential to keep growing revenue and profit at strong rates.\n\n\u201cGOOGL\u2019s 2Q highlights the still long advertising runway and robust innovation-driven revenue growth potential (search, YouTube, cloud, etc) ... we remain longterm bulls given GOOGL\u2019s strong top-line momentum and reasonable valuation for growth,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.\n\nThe brokerage cut its price target to $1,040 from $1,050, one of at least five brokerages to do so. Google\u2019s stock closed at $998.31, not far from the median price target of $1,065.",
