        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google this week will disclose technical details of its new Titan computer chip, an elaborate security feature for its cloud computing network that the company hopes will enable it to steal a march on Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).\n\nTitan is the size of a tiny stud earring that Google has installed in each of the many thousands of computer servers and network cards that populate its massive data centers that power Google\u2019s cloud services.\n\nGoogle is hoping Titan will help it carve out a bigger piece of the worldwide cloud computing market, which is forecast by Gartner to be worth nearly $50 billion.\n\nA Google spokeswoman said the company plans to disclose Titan\u2019s technical details in a blog post on Thursday.\n\nTitan scans hardware to ensure it has not been tampered with, Neal Mueller, head of infrastructure product marketing for Google Cloud Platform, said in a recent interview. If anything has been changed, Titan chip will prevent the machine from booting.\n\nData center operators are concerned that cyber criminals or nation-state hackers could compromise their servers, which are mostly made by Asian hardware companies, before they even reach the United States.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to maintain a level of understanding in our supply chain that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Mueller said.\n\nNeither Amazon.com nor Microsoft - which hold 41 percent and 13 percent of cloud market share, respectively, according to Synergy Research Group - have said if they have similar features. In response to inquiries from Reuters, representatives of both companies pointed to the various ways they use encryption and other measures to secure their data centers.\n\nGoogle holds just 7 percent of the worldwide cloud market. Titan is part of a strategy Google hopes will differentiate its services and attract enterprise customers from sectors with complex compliance regulations, such as those in financial services and the medical field. Google announced Titan in March.\n\n\u201cHaving physical safeguards goes a long way of telling the story of how seriously Google takes people\u2019s security,\u201d said Kim Forrest, vice president at Fort Pitt Capital Group.\n\nGoogle has struggled to compete with Amazon Web Services, which has more features, and Microsoft, which has long-standing relationships with enterprises, said Lydia Leong, an analyst for Gartner.\n\n\u201dSecurity is a hallmark for both AWS and Microsoft,\u201d she said this week. \u201cGoogle has a lot more work to do.\u201d\n\nGoogle uses Titan chips to protect the servers running its own services like search, Gmail and YouTube, and the company claims Titan has already driven sales. It points to Metamarkets, a real-time analytics firm, as a customer it landed in part due to Titan.\n\nDan Cornell, principal at Denim Group, a firm that helps tech organizations build secure systems, said the rise of nation-state hacking makes such a feature timely.\n\n\u201dThose level of adversaries certainly have an incentive to hack or to have influence over the security of hardware. It\u2019s interesting of Google to say, \u2018Here\u2019s one part of the hardware that we\u2019re going to control.'\u201d",
