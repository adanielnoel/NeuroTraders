        "body": "Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t sympathize with the actor Cindy Lee Garcia, who was baldly deceived into appearing in the abhorrent anti-Islam film \u201cInnocence of Muslims\u201d?\n\nThe filmmaker, a shadowy character who goes by three different names, told Garcia she\u2019d be appearing in \u201cDesert Warrior,\u201d an adventure movie set in the Middle East. Instead, he overdubbed her lines to make it appear as though the actress was accusing the prophet Mohammed of pedophilia, and included her brief scene in a screed so incendiary that it inspired riots in Egypt and elsewhere in the Muslim world.\n\nTargeted by death threats, Garcia eventually sued Google to force its YouTube unit to block the video. In February, she won a ruling from a divided three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals, ordering Google to take down the film because Garcia was likely to prevail on her claim that \u2018Innocence\u2019 infringes her copyright on her individual performance.\n\nThe 9th Circuit opinion, written by Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, set off a furor of its own in the film industry, in which hundreds of individuals contribute to a single finished product. Could any one of them \u2013 actors, set designers, makeup artists \u2013 block distribution of a movie by crying infringement? In March, when Google\u2019s lawyers at Hogan Lovells petitioned for a rehearing before the entire 9th Circuit, they pointed out that the panel\u2019s ruling was at odds with the U.S. Copyright Office\u2019s policy \u2013 and with the Copyright Office\u2019s brand-new determination that Garcia is not entitled to a copyright on the performance that showed up in \u201cInnocence.\u201d\n\nThis week was the deadline for amicus briefs on Google\u2019s petition. And if Garcia felt alone and exposed before, she must feel even more so now.\n\nTen briefs were filed on behalf of dozens of academics, news organizations, Internet companies such as Twitter and Netflix, and public interest groups including the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Public Citizen. Not one supports Garcia. Every brief urges the entire 9th Circuit to reconsider the panel\u2019s Garcia ruling because Kozinski got it wrong.\n\nGarcia\u2019s lawyer, Cris Armenta of The Armenta Law Firm looked for a silver lining in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThe sheer volume of briefs and words \u2026 appears to epitomize the David versus Goliath position my client is in,\u201d Armenta said. \u201cFortunately, we have laws so that the majority \u2013 Google and its friends and family \u2013 doesn\u2019t always win.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of heft, though, in the arguments by Google\u2019s amici. Broadly speaking, they fall into three categories. One group \u2013 including Netflix, documentary filmmakers, IP professors and an array of Internet companies such as Facebook, Pinterest and eBay \u2013 claim that the 9th Circuit opinion is plain unworkable. Documentarians and other content creators wouldn\u2019t be able to create their films if they had to obtain explicit releases from everyone who might have an independent copyright under the standard the 9th Circuit created in the Garcia opinion, according to the filmmakers\u2019 brief. Third-party distributors like Netflix wouldn\u2019t be able to do business, according to Netflix\u2019s brief, if they were subject to injunction suits by every performer in every film or television show they licensed. And according to the Internet companies, sites that make user-created content available to the public aren\u2019t supposed to have to police that content to ward off infringing material, as the 9th Circuit injunction would force Google to do. Most of them \u201csimply would not have the personnel or financial resources even to attempt compliance\u201d with take-down orders like the one the 9th Circuit imposed on Google, the brief said.\n\nAnother set of briefs, including those from Internet law professors and a website for fan-created content, focused on the framework Congress established to deal with intermediaries on the web. Federal law explicitly shields such companies from liability for content created by users, except when that content infringes copyrights. As a result, the law professors\u2019 brief said, copyright claims are increasingly likely to be asserted, in dubious ways, to force intermediaries to block content. The 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling, according to the briefs, opens the door to yet more abuses of the copyright loophole in Congress\u2019s protection of Internet intermediaries.\n\nFinally, Google\u2019s friends from the news industry and several public interest groups contend that the 9th Circuit ruling tramples free speech by imposing a prior restraint. When the 9th Circuit panel granted Garcia an injunction, these briefs argue, it didn\u2019t appropriately balance the equities, under the injunction test the U.S. Supreme Court set out in its 2006 decision in eBay v. MercExchange.\n\nThe panel should have weighed the harm of the alleged infringement of Garcia\u2019s brief performance \u2013 and not the threats to her well-being \u2013 against the prior restraint it was imposing on free speech. Kozinski\u2019s opinion never even considered whether Google was engaged in fair use by permitting links to \u201cInnocence,\u201d the First Amendment briefs said.\n\nGarcia counsel Armenta, of course, has an answer to all of the arguments by Google\u2019s friends. Google and its amici, she told me, are attempting to extrapolate horrors from an opinion the 9th Circuit kept narrow and fact-based. Reputable film makers already obtain releases from performers, she said. So the only time the rights of individual contributors would become a problem, according to Armenta, are in the extremely rare circumstances of a content creator deceiving a performer, as the \u201cInnocence\u201d filmmaker duped Garcia. \u201cThe sky is not falling, the industry will not come to a halt,\u201d she said.\n\nGarcia\u2019s First Amendment and copyright protections are as valid as Google\u2019s, she continued. And in this case, the film portrays the actress as saying something she never actually said. \u201cBalancing the equities weighs in Cindy\u2019s favor,\u201d her lawyer said. \u201cThe principles of the First Amendment are safely intact in this opinion. It\u2019s a smoke and mirrors trick to say that this will in any way stifle free speech.\u201d\n\nAs for the statutory protection for Internet intermediaries, Armenta cites the loophole for copyright infringement. If Google had followed its own protocols for reviewing take-down notices, she said, it wouldn\u2019t be on the wrong end of the 9th Circuit opinion.\n\nGoogle is a company with deep and wide influence, as we learned in the Oracle copyright litigation when U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco ordered both companies to disclose payments to commenters, bloggers and other opinion-shaping organizations. I\u2019m sure that it has worked before with some of the amici (or their lawyers) in the Garcia case. But that doesn\u2019t make their arguments less of an onslaught for Garcia.\n\nThe 9th Circuit should have a decision on the en banc decision sometime next month. Google counsel Neal Katyal of Hogan declined to comment.\n\nFor more of my posts, please go to WestlawNext Practitioner Insights",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Google Inc has acquired solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace as the Web search giant ramps up plans to deliver wireless Internet access to remote parts of the world.\n\nTitan Chief Executive Vern Raburn declined to provide information on the price of the deal, which he said closed on Monday morning.\n\nThe 20-person company will remain in New Mexico for the foreseeable future, Raburn said, with all employees joining Google.\n\nThe deal could further Google\u2019s efforts to deliver Internet access to remote regions of the world. Last year Google launched a small network of balloons designed to deliver Internet access over the Southern Hemisphere, dubbed as Project Loon.\n\n\u201cAtmospheric satellites could help bring internet access to millions of people, and help solve other problems, including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation,\u201d Google said in an emailed statement confirming the Titan acquisition.\n\nGoogle\u2019s acquisition of Titan comes several weeks after rival Facebook Inc announced plans to build solar-powered drones and satellites capable of beaming Internet access to underdeveloped parts of the world. A few weeks before Facebook\u2019s announcement, press reports said that Facebook was in discussions to acquire Titan.\n\nTitan is developing a variety of solar-powered \u201catmospheric satellites,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website, with initial commercial operations slated for 2015. The drones, which fly at an altitude of 65,000 feet and can remain aloft for up to five years and have a 165-foot (50-meter) wingspan, slightly shorter than that of a Boeing 777.\n\nNews of the acquisition was first reported on Monday by the Wall Street Journal.",
