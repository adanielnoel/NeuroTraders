        "body": "(Reuters) - Oracle Corp has asked a U.S. judge for permission to update its copyright lawsuit against Google Inc to include the Android operating system\u2019s current market dominance.\n\nThe move by Oracle is its first since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the case to continue and suggests the litigation could be far from over.\n\nThe closely watched case involves how much copyright protection should extend to Java programming language, which Google used to design its Android smartphone operating system.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Android operating system is the world\u2019s best-selling smartphone platform. Oracle sued Google five years ago and is seeking roughly $1 billion in copyright claims.\n\nOracle said it wants to update the copyright lawsuit, filed in October 2010, to add that Google continues its copyright infringement through updated versions of Android in both existing and new markets and this is resulting in harm to Oracle and benefit to Google.\n\n\u201cThe record of the first trial does not reflect any of these developments in the market, including Google\u2019s dramatically enhanced market position in search engine advertising and the overall financial results from its continuing and expanded infringement,\u201d Oracle wrote in a letter to Judge William Alsup on Wednesday.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an appeals court\u2019s ruling that allows Oracle to seek licensing fees for the use of some of the Java language. Google had said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee.",
