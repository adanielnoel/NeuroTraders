        "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany said on Tuesday that Facebook, Google and Twitter have agreed to delete hate speech from their websites within 24 hours, a new step in the fight against rising online racism following the refugee crisis.\n\nThe government has been trying to get social platforms to crack down on the rise in anti-foreigner comments in German on the web as the country struggles to cope with an influx of more than 1 million refugees this year.\n\nThe new agreement makes it easier for users and anti-racism groups to report hate speech to specialist teams at the three companies, German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said.\n\n\u201cWhen the limits of free speech are trespassed, when it is about criminal expressions, sedition, incitement to carry out criminal offences that threaten people, such content has to be deleted from the net,\u201d Maas said. \u201cAnd we agree that as a rule this should be possible within 24 hours.\u201d\n\nGermany last month launched an investigation into the European head of Facebook over its alleged failure to remove racist hate speech.\n\nMartin Ott, Facebook\u2019s managing director for northern, central and eastern Europe based in Hamburg, may be held responsible for the social platform\u2019s failure to remove hate speech, a spokeswoman for the prosecution said last month.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said the allegations lack merit and there has been no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees.\n\nFacebook has a partnership with a group called FSM, which monitors multimedia service providers on a voluntary basis, and has said it would encourage its users to push back against racism.\n\nVandals attacked its offices in the northern city of Hamburg at the weekend, damaging the entrance to the building and spraying \u201cFacebook dislike\u201d on a wall.",
