The problem is when this happens in the middle of the day, there is no time for a conference call to massage it. There is no time for analysts\u2019 questions and for an evaluation,\u201d said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cNow you shoot first and ask questions later.\u201d\n\nBut losses were lower on the S&P 500 and Dow, which were helped by positive earnings from Verizon and Travelers Companies. Google is not one of the Dow Industrial\u2019s 30 components.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc reported revenue that slightly exceeded expectations while U.S. property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos posted record operating earnings that were much stronger than expected.\n\nTravelers gained 3.6 percent to $73.98 as the biggest boost to the Dow. Verizon rose 2.8 percent to $45.97. The S&P telecom sector index, up 1.9 percent, was the best performer among the S&P 500\u2019s 10 major sectors.\n\n\u201cThird-quarter earnings are not spectacular, that\u2019s for sure. But the bar is so low that as long as the businesses aren\u2019t falling apart, the earnings aren\u2019t collapsing,\u201d said Doug Foreman, director of equities at Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.13 points, or 0.08 percent, to 13,545.87. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index lost 4.39 points, or 0.30 percent, to 1,456.52.

Analysts had expected claims to rise to 365,000, though a Labor Department official said it appeared state-level administrative issues were distorting the data.\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters data through Thursday morning with 19 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported results, 64.9 percent have beaten analysts\u2019 expectations. The average since 2002 has been a beat rate of 62 percent.\n\nQuarterly earnings are expected to drop 1.5 percent from a year ago, an improvement from the forecast earlier in the week calling for a decline of 2.3 percent.",

Trading of the stock was halted at 12:50 p.m. Trading resumed at 3:20 p.m.\n\nThe slide in Google\u2019s stock after the midday surprise was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. Tech stocks suffered, with the S&P 500 information technology index losing 1.53 percent. Shares of IBM, which disappointed investors a day earlier, lost 2.8 percent to close at $194.96 and pull the Dow lower.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge impact on the market, and especially the tech stocks,\u201d said Paul Nolte, managing director at Dearborn Partners in Chicago. \u201cWhat happened to Google is a continuation in the tech sector of some very poor earnings numbers. But we\u2019re not seeing the same lack of performance across the board from other sectors.\u201d\n\nTravelers gained 3.6 percent to $73.94 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow after the U.S. property and casualty insurance company posted record operating earnings.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc rose 2.4 percent to $45.78 after the company reported a record quarterly profit. Verizon attributed these gains to its wireless business. It also posted revenue that slightly exceeded expectations.\n\nMorgan Stanley reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly earnings on Thursday as big gains in its bond trading business boosted its revenue. The stock fell, however, losing 3.8 percent to $17.79.\n\nTechnology was by far the day\u2019s weakest sector, but seven of the S&P 500\u2019s 10 sectors ended the session higher.\n\nOverall, with 19 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported results, quarterly earnings are expected to drop 1.5 percent from a year ago - an improvement from a decline of 3 percent forecast earlier in the week, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nAfter the close, Microsoft reported that its fiscal first-quarter profit fell, hurt by a dip in computer sales running its Windows operating system. Microsoft\u2019s stock fell 1.2 percent after the bell. It had closed at $29.50, down 0.3 percent in regular trading.\n\nPhilip Morris International was also scheduled to post earnings after the bell on Thursday.\n\nWeak jobs data released on Thursday also weighed on the market. Weekly jobless claims rose to 388,000 - or 32,000 more than analysts expected. A Labor Department official said it appeared that state-level administrative issues were distorting the data.\n\n\u201cOn a longer-term basis and non-seasonally adjusted basis, the jobs numbers are in line with where they\u2019re been all year.

        "body": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s shares have clung tenaciously near record highs after a three-month, 30 percent rally fueled by rising optimism about Internet advertising, but Wall Street fears it may be running out of steam.\n\nGoogle stock has hovered near an all-time high of $774.38 since touching that peak on October 5. To break through that level, investors and analysts say it needs to run a gauntlet of risks that could undermine its status as technology\u2019s second-most valuable company.\n\nThe most immediate concerns center on competition in the mobile arena, which is shaping up as the main battleground for tech supremacy among Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc.\n\nInvestors point out that Google\u2019s Android - despite being the world\u2019s most-used mobile software - has yet to yield significant revenue growth. And the company has not yet articulated a coherent strategy in the wake of its $12.5 billion acquisition in May of cellphone maker Motorola Mobility.\n\nIn the longer term, a rising wave of regulatory scrutiny both at home and abroad could represent the single biggest risk to the Google story. Regulators are looking into whether Google is competing unfairly by favoring its own properties in its core search product, and whether it inappropriately uses sensitive personal data to target ads.\n\nTo be sure, of 45 investment brokerages that cover Google, 36 rate it a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy,\u201d with the median price target standing at $845 - up another 12 percent from current levels - and the most bullish target at $910. Among portfolio managers, at least one maintains a $1,300 target, after factoring in Google\u2019s growing cash and securities pile.\n\n\u201cTheir business model alone makes them an incredibly easy target for a whole bunch of legal matters,\u201d said Kim Forrest, an analyst and portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group who recently owned Google shares.\n\n\u201cTo date they\u2019ve done well managing it,\u201d Forrest said, referring to Google\u2019s interactions with regulators. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s their big risk. Most investors don\u2019t fully understand that, professionals as well as retail.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s run-ins with regulators over the years have invited comparisons to Microsoft and IBM, two tech giants that were once distracted and constrained by long-running antitrust battles.\n\n\u201dThey seem to be well-positioned in display ads and mobile, which are nascent industries,\u201c said Connor Browne, portfolio manager of the Thornburg Value Fund. \u201dThe biggest risk by far is regulators bringing an antitrust case, a la the Microsoft Internet Explorer suit that company faced.\n\n\u201cOur expectations are nothing material for the stock, but that could be one of the reasons why the valuation is not higher now.\u201d\n\nSources told Reuters last week that a majority of commissioners at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was poised to recommend, possibly as early as November, that the government bring an antitrust lawsuit against Google.\n\nSeveral companies, including Yelp Inc, have accused Google of tilting its search algorithm so that links to its own subsidiaries appear more often in its search results. Google processes two-thirds of all Internet queries in the United States and roughly 90 percent in Europe.\n\nBut analogies to previous antitrust cases may be off-base, analysts say.\n\nThe FTC is not likely to demand actions nearly as dramatic as the forced breakup of telecom giant AT&T in 1984, but the constant threat of antitrust investigations \u201cmakes it a more highly scrutinized company and therefore they need to tread more carefully than others,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a perception issue\u201d that could affect how aggressively Google tweaks its search algorithms, he added.\n\nThe bar for antitrust enforcement remains high. Regulators must show that aside from stifling competitors, Google\u2019s actions hurt consumers. Even if the FTC proceeds against the company, it is unlikely to try to alter its strategy of developing the Google+ social network, as well as its Maps and consumer review products, into a comprehensive, searchable database of people and businesses, analysts say. Rather, it is likely to press the company to disclose which search results are generated from Google properties, or seek other tweaks that the company has seemed willing to make, analysts say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s miles from Microsoft,\u201d said David Balto, a former FTC policy director and antitrust lawyer. \u201cIt would be fruitless to try to identify any consumer harm comparable to what Microsoft engaged in.\u201d\n\nMore critical may be the search giant\u2019s regular entanglements with privacy regulators, especially in Europe. Google, like Yahoo Inc and Facebook, relies on the ability to track users while they surf the Web as an essential driver of its advertising business.\n\nThis week, European Union authorities threatened Google with fines unless it amended its privacy policy after the company consolidated user data across its products, like Gmail and Google Plus, to better target advertising.\n\nThe risk is that it could get ensnared in complex, pan-global privacy investigations that hamper its ability to collect user data.\n\n\u201cPrivacy is the bigger risk,\u201d said Sebastian, the Baird analyst. \u201cIf Google were not allowed to target advertising, that would hurt monetization. It\u2019s a headline risk that can cause choppiness in the stock.\u201d\n\nGoogle itself has been clear that its biggest priority for now is the mobile device battle with Apple, which Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt called the \u201cdefining fight\u201d of the high-tech industry.\n\nThe Android operating system accounts for 56 percent of the market, according to Strategy Analytics, but it is losing share to one-time partner Apple, which surged from 23.2 percent market share in the second quarter of 2012 to 33.2 percent a year later on the back of strong sales of its iPhone 4S.\n\nAnd the deal for Motorola, its largest-ever acquisition, will remain under scrutiny until the division can turn a profit.\n\n\u201cIt seems like every new business they\u2019ve gone into has diluted their net income. Shareholders would like to know how they\u2019re going to get paid,\u201d said Forrest, who expects Google\u2019s recent share gains to level out for the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cThe biggest beneficiary of people adopting Android is Microsoft, because they get paid an $8 license (per device) for their patents.\u201d\n\nSome, however, see a lot to like in Google\u2019s prospects.\n\nThe company dominates search, and processes a full two-thirds of all Internet queries in the United States.\n\nGoogle also seems well-positioned to adjust to a sweeping change in consumer behavior that is afflicting its peers. People are spending increasing time on their smartphones and tablets, but advertising rates on mobile devices command only 56 to 71 percent the price of ads - or \u201ccost per click\u201d - on laptops and PCs, according to an Adobe Systems Inc study.\n\nGoogle appeared to suffer a blip in the second quarter, when it reported a 16 percent decline in its search ads\u2019 \u201ccost per click\u201d compared with a year ago, but analysts say the long-term forecast for Google\u2019s mobile transition remains upbeat.\n\nWith the help of its AdMob acquisition, completed last year, and the rise of video advertising on its YouTube platform, Google seems well-positioned.\n\nRising advertising rates for mobile searches and earnings growth rates of over 20 percent over the next two years could make the company\u2019s shares worth $1,300 in 2014, assuming a 15 times earnings multiple and factoring in cash, argued Browne, who owns shares in his $2.1 billion Thornburg Value fund.\n\nHe said desktop searches should account for about 70 percent of Google\u2019s total ad revenue, followed by display ads at 15 percent and mobile searches at 10 percent.\n\n\u201cWe give them zero credit for Motorola, assuming no big profits and no big losses,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile his estimate is not as lofty, Paul Meeks, an analyst at Saturna Capital who covers technology for the $2.2 billion Amana Growth Fund, said shares of Google should trade at $854, a 13 percent jump from Wednesday\u2019s closing price of $755.49. He arrived at that price by assuming a 15 multiple on next year\u2019s projected earnings of $49 a share - a tad above Wall Street\u2019s current average expectations - and adding in $113 per share based on the company\u2019s large cash position.\n\n\u201cThis is a company that starts with essentially a monopolist position in desktop search, and now through Android they are capturing more than half of the mobile ad revenue dollars,\u201d Meeks said.\n\nBut other investors in the company are preparing to pare back or sell their positions after the recent run-up.\n\n\u201cThe stock is more fairly valued now than it was when we picked it up in the fourth quarter of last year,\u201d said Daniel Morris, who manages the $4.3 million Manor Growth fund. Google needs to show that it can wring profit from its growing number of searches for the stock in order to move higher, he said.\n\nThe stock also tends to rise and fall with an advertising market that is in turn tied to investor sentiment, said Steve Sorrano, equities analyst for Calvert Investments. He said that latecomers might not want to jump on the investor bandwagon right now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get hurt if you own that stock too late in the cycle,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s quarterly results fell well short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations after its core advertising business slowed, stunning investors accustomed to consistently rapid growth from the Internet giant and wiping more than 9 percent off its market value.\n\nThe disappointing numbers on Thursday came hours ahead of schedule in a rare instance of premature filing. Google blamed the misfire on an unauthorized filing by its financial printers, RR Donnelley & Sons Co, and later confirmed the numbers\u2019 accuracy.\n\nThe earnings report, which had not been expected until after the market close, revealed a weakening in Google\u2019s core Internet advertising business and persistent losses at its recently acquired cellphone business, Motorola Mobility.\n\nShares of Google, the world\u2019s No. 1 Internet search engine, finished Thursday\u2019s regular trading session down 8 percent at $695 after a brief trading halt. Some analysts said the inadvertent results release spurred confusion and exacerbated its stock price decline.\n\nGoogle executives maintained in a conference call on Thursday that the company\u2019s various businesses continued to benefit from healthy growth and that Google was well-positioned to capitalize on consumer\u2019s increasing use of mobile devices.\n\nChief Executive Larry Page, speaking on his first earnings call since an unspecified voice ailment sidelined him from public speaking in June, said that Google\u2019s mobile business was now generating revenue at an annualized run rate of $8 billion.\n\nPage acknowledged that mobile ad rates were below the rates that Google garners for ads that appear on its standard website. But he said the variety of Web-connected devices used by consumers is creating \u201ca huge new universe of opportunities for advertisers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re uniquely positioned to get through that transition and to really profit from it,\u201d Page said, citing Google\u2019s Android mobile software, the world\u2019s top operating system for smartphones by market share.\n\nGoogle, which has been struggling to turn around a Motorola Mobility hardware business it bought for $12.5 billion, reported a 20 percent dive in net income to $2.18 billion. Excluding certain items, it earned $9.03 a share, vastly underperforming the $10.65 analysts had expected, on average.\n\n\u201cWe have been saying this thing was ripe for a pullback. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re Google not being Google, but you still have some major issues,\u201d said BCG analyst Colin Gillis.\n\n\u201cClick prices declined for the fourth consecutive quarter after rising for eight consecutive quarters before then. That\u2019s a negative. This is the mobile problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other bit is the Motorola millstone had been ignored by the market, and - boom - now you\u2019ve got weak revenue from Motorola. When you acquire a business and you\u2019re about to whack all kinds of people and close offices, you know what happens to the employees? They take their eye off the ball. Sales are down,\u201d Gillis explained.\n\nNet revenue growth at Google\u2019s main Internet business increased 17 percent year-over-year, the first time growth in that business has fallen below 20 percent since 2009. Google Finance Chief Patrick Pichette stressed on the conference call that the revenue growth rate was higher if the impact of foreign currency exchange rates was backed out.\n\n\u201cIt was just too rapid a deceleration,\u201d said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. \u201cMany of the same underlying trends drive Facebook advertising.\u201d\n\nShares of Facebook Inc, which headed south shortly after Google\u2019s inadvertent filing, closed down 4.6 percent. Google\u2019s snafu recalled Facebook\u2019s debut, which was marred by technical glitches that also spooked traders and contributed to the stock\u2019s first-day decline.\n\nThe decline in Google\u2019s shares come after a three-month run-up in its stock, which reached an all-time high of $774.38 earlier this month.\n\nGoogle reported net revenue - excluding traffic acquisition costs - of $11.3 billion for the third quarter, below Wall Street\u2019s expectations for about $11.9 billion.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive quarter, the company reported a decline in average cost-per-click (CPC), a critical metric that denotes the price advertisers pay Google.\n\nAverage CPC declined 15 percent from a year ago and 3 percent from the second quarter of this year. Analysts say that Google, like many of its peers in the Internet industry, has been struggling to adapt to the rapid consumer uptake in mobile devices. Advertisers pay far less for ads on smartphones and tablets than for similar ads on desktop computers.\n\n\u201cThe core business seems to have slowed down pretty significantly, which is shocking,\u201d said B. Riley analyst Sameet Sinha. \u201cThe only conclusion I can look at is, search is happening more and more outside of Google, meaning people are searching more through apps than through Google search.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat could indicate a secular change, especially when it comes to ecommerce searches. The big fear has always been, what if people decide just to go straight to Amazon and do their searches? And potentially that\u2019s what could be happening.\u201d\n\nBut Ryan Jacob, chairman and chief investment officer of Jacob Funds, said he viewed Google\u2019s results as only \u201cminorly disappointing,\u201d with most of the weakness coming from Motorola as expected.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, by dropping an 8K in the middle of a trading day, people kind of shoot first, ask questions later,\u201d said Jacob, whose fund owns Google shares.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note that the Google results were \u201clight\u201d but not as bad as they appeared at \u201cfirst blush.\u201d\n\nGoogle, which recently overtook Microsoft Corp to become the second-largest U.S. technology company by capitalization, had been due to release its results after the market close.\n\nThe second paragraph of the press release merely read \u201cPending Larry quote,\u201d suggesting that space was reserved for comment from CEO Larry Page.\n\n\u201cEarlier this morning RR Donnelley, the financial printer, informed us that they had filed our draft 8K earnings statement without authorization,\u201d Google said in a statement. \u201cWe have ceased trading on NASDAQ while we work to finalize the document. Once it\u2019s finalized we will release our earnings, resume trading on NASDAQ and hold our earnings call as normal at 1:30 PM PT.\u201d\n\nShares of RR Donnelley, the U.S. printing services company, slid as much as 5 percent. They closed down 1 percent at $10.76.\n\nReed Kathrein, a plaintiff lawyer with Hagens Berman who sues companies on behalf of investors, said investors would not have a claim against either Google or RR Donnelley because the earnings disclosure was likely a mistake.\n\nHowever, Google could have a negligence claim against RR Donnelly to recover any additional costs it incurred in responding to the incident, Kathrein added.\n\n\u201cEveryone is trying to figure out if there\u2019s any legal issue with respect to RR Donnelley,\u201d said Michael Matousek, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc, which manages about $3 billion in San Antonio.",

        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews journalist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nGoogle\u2019s hardware ambitions are proving surprisingly costly. The search giant paid $12.5 billion for Motorola\u2019s handset business. The division lost another $527 million in the third quarter and the mistaken early release of unexpectedly weak earnings knocked over $20 billion off Google\u2019s market capitalization in afternoon trade. A bigger concern is the risk of long-term management distraction.\n\nWhile no company wants to release an earnings statement that begins \u201cPENDING LARRY QUOTE\u201d in the middle of a trading day, Google doesn\u2019t appear to be at fault. It blames RR Donnelley, the financial printer. But the search giant can\u2019t point the finger at anyone else for the awful results inside. Earnings fell 20 percent from a year ago to $2.2 billion.\n\nSo far, Google\u2019s big bet on hardware isn\u2019t paying off. Not only is Motorola losing sizable chunks of cash, but sales are shrinking. Turning around the division will not be easy since, unlike much-larger rival Samsung, it can\u2019t harness huge cost efficiencies. Revamping the business will also take time, making Motorola a likely drag on profits for several quarters.\n\nThat could take management\u2019s eye off a more pressing problem: Google\u2019s ad business. The number of people clicking on its ads rocketed 33 percent compared to last year as more and more users perform searches on cellphones and tablets. But Google, like Facebook, still hasn\u2019t entirely figured out how to get advertisers to pay more for mobile hits. The amount paid per click fell 15 percent over the past year. That dragged down net ad business revenue growth to about 17 percent, or roughly half the rate of clicks.\n\nGetting advertisers to pay more for mobile would supercharge Google\u2019s ad business. Unfortunately, Google executives have plenty of other messes to sort out, such as fixing the phone business \u2013 and finding snappier quotes from Chief Executive Larry Page.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co handles thousands of securities filings a year for corporate clients in a routine process that is invisible to most investors. On Thursday Google and its shareholders found out just what happens when that process goes wrong.\n\nGoogle issued a statement blaming Donnelley, its filing agent, after the Internet search company\u2019s quarterly results were released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hours ahead of schedule.\n\nEarnings were far less than analysts expected and Google shares immediately plunged as much as 10.5 percent, knocking $26 billion off its market capitalization - the equivalent, as it happens, of about 13 R.R. Donnelleys.\n\nIt was quickly obvious that a mistake had been made -- the second paragraph of the filing said \u201cPENDING LARRY QUOTE\u201d instead of an actual quote from Google CEO Larry Page -- but it was not clear why.\n\nWithin minutes, though, an unknown prankster set up a \u201cPendingLarry\u201d Twitter feed to hypothesize what the missing quote might be. Among the highlights: \u201cMan, our privacy was WAY violated today.\u201d\n\nDonnelley shares lost more than 5 percent after Google started pointing the finger, though they recovered later in the day. The company did not respond to a call for comment, but issued a statement to CNBC in which it said it was investigating the circumstances of the release.\n\nBest known as a provider of printing services, Donnelley is also the top SEC filing agent in the country, handling more than 75,000 submissions this year as of mid-October, according to SECInfo.com.\n\nFiling agents like Donnelley take paper documents and convert them for submission to the SEC in the appropriate format. The company also owns the filing portal EDGAR Online.\n\nIt is far from the first time a company\u2019s earnings have somehow gotten out early.\n\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, inadvertent releases - usually by a misplaced release on a website - plagued companies like Walt Disney Co and Microsoft Corp.\n\nThe common thread in all of those cases is that investors who are not in the right place at the right time to see the news may suffer for it.\n\n\u201cSome who didn\u2019t get a chance to sell will try to, and others will be looking for bargains. I\u2018m sure a lot of Google owners were caught off guard,\u201d said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\nAfter the first question of \u201cwho goofed?\u201d was sorted out Thursday afternoon, the second one being asked by investors was \u201ccan we sue?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is trying to figure out if there\u2019s any legal issue with respect to R.R. Donnelley. Google is halted, Donnelley is down big-time on the news since they\u2019re allegedly not supposed to have released the information,\u201d said Michael Matousek, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors in San Antonio.\n\nBut one plaintiffs lawyer who sues companies on behalf of investors said shareholders would not have a claim against either Google or R.R. Donnelley because the earnings disclosure was likely a mistake.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fraudulent intent here,\u201d said Reed Kathrein with Hagens Berman.\n\nR.R. Donnelley may not be entirely off the hook with Google, however. The company could have a negligence claim to recover any additional costs it incurred in responding to the incident, Kathrein said.\n\nAny potential damages against R.R. Donnelley could be limited, though, by the contract between the two companies.\n\nLate Thursday, Google filed an amended press release with the missing quote and a confirmation that the figures in the original were accurate.\n\nR.R. Donnelley shares were up 2 cents at $10.87 in late trading. Google was down 8.1 percent to $693.94 after trading resumed.",

Verizon attributed these gains to its wireless business. It also posted revenue that slightly exceeded expectations.\n\nMorgan Stanley reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly earnings on Thursday as big gains in its bond trading business increased its revenue. The stock fell, however, losing 3.8 percent to $17.79.\n\nTechnology was by far the day\u2019s weakest sector, but seven of the S&P 500\u2019s 10 sectors ended the session higher.\n\nWeak jobs data released on Thursday also weighed on the market. Weekly jobless claims rose to 388,000 - or 32,000 more than analysts expected.

Microsoft\u2019s stock extended its decline in after-hours trading, falling 3.2 percent. The stock had closed the regular session at $29.50, down 0.3 percent.\n\nIn other earnings news after the bell, PC chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc reported disappointing quarterly results and announced that it would cut its workforce by 15 percent. The stock rose 3.4 percent after the bell. AMD had ended the regular session at $2.62, down 5.4 percent.\n\nSanDisk Corp shares rose 5 percent after the bell when the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings beat expectations, helped by a rebound in flash memory prices. The stock closed at $42.86, down 3.3 percent in the regular session.\n\nFast-food restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc reported quarterly earnings after the close that missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Shares of the Denver-based burrito chain lost 12.4 percent in after-hours trading, falling to $250.50 - the lowest level since May 2011. Chipotle\u2019s stock ended the regular session at $285.93, down 1.4 percent.\n\nVolume was roughly 6.9 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, compared with the year-to-date average daily closing volume of 6.52 billion.\n\nDecliners slightly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of about 15 to 14.
