        "body": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, California (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama told Google employees on Wednesday his meteoric rise in politics mirrored the company\u2019s emergence as the lifeblood of the Internet and he surprised his hosts by answering a geeky engineering question.\n\n\u201cThere is something improbable about this gathering,\u201d the Illinois senator told a packed cafe auditorium of hundreds of Google employees. \u201cWhat we share is a belief in changing the world from the bottom up.\u201d\n\nObama, 46, noted that a decade ago he was a little-known Illinois state senator and the founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were university students with big dreams. He cited the Google founders\u2019 success when asked about his relative lack of political experience.\n\n\u201cI suppose Sergey and Larry did not have a lot of experience starting a Fortune 100 company,\u201d said Obama.\n\nSome employees lined up more than an hour to hear Obama while others crowded the rafters above the auditorium.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a buzz here all day,\u201d said Nicole Resz, 26, who works in Google\u2019s advertising department. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many people at a Google event. We\u2019ve had everybody, we\u2019ve had Mikhail Gorbachev.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fresh, he\u2019s new, there\u2019s something about him that\u2019s Google-like.\u201d\n\nSix other presidential candidates, including Democrats Hillary Clinton and John Edwards and Republican John McCain have already spoken at Google, which has become a major stop on the campaign trail this year.\n\nObama tailored his speech to an Internet-savvy audience, portraying technology as vital to winning in the global economy and in areas like health care and clean energy.\n\nHe pledged to post government data on the Internet \u201cin universally accessible formats.\u201d Google has begun offering a suite of software products to rival those of Microsoft Corp that would benefit from such a government policy.\n\nObama was prepared when Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the event moderator, asked him the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers.\n\nObama said he did not favor the bubble sort method, impressing engineers by his reference to a method of sorting out numerical algorithms.",
