The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York revived Viacom\u2019s case last April, but Thursday\u2019s decision restores YouTube\u2019s original victory.\n\nViacom said it plans to appeal. \u201cThis ruling ignores the opinions of the higher courts and completely disregards the rights of creative artists,\u201d spokesman Jeremy Zweig said in an email. \u201cA jury should weigh the facts of this case and the overwhelming evidence that YouTube willfully infringed.\u201d\n\nKent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, welcomed the decision. \u201cCongress got it right when it comes to copyright on the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a win not just for YouTube, but for people everywhere who depend on the Internet to exchange ideas and information.\u201d\n\nIn reviving Viacom\u2019s lawsuit, the 2nd Circuit panel said \u201ca reasonable jury could find that YouTube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website.\u201d\n\nIt then sent the case back to Stanton to consider whether YouTube had or \u201cwillfully blinded\u201d itself to this knowledge.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s decision, Stanton said the burden of proof remained on Viacom, rejecting its \u201cingenious\u201d yet \u201cextravagant\u201d argument that YouTube did not deserve the safe harbor, and should instead monitor the contents of videos being uploaded at a rate of more than 24 hours of viewing time per minute.\n\nStanton concluded that YouTube neither exhibited willful blindness, nor had the ability to control infringing activity, nor \u201cinteracted with infringing users to a point where it might be said to have participated in their infringing activity.\u201d\n\nDozens of content providers have supported Viacom in the battle, including the Associated Press, Gannett Co, the National Football League, Garth Brooks, the Eagles and Sting.\n\nAmong the supporters of Google and YouTube were eBay Inc, Facebook Inc, Yahoo Inc, Human Rights Watch and Consumers Union.\n\nNew York-based Viacom is controlled by Sumner Redstone and owns cable networks such as MTV and Comedy Central as well as the Paramount movie studio.

        "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - What\u2019s the best way to deal with a complex legal case that threatens to drag on for years while leaving unchecked a dominant player in an economically important market?\n\nFor EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia, the answer in the case of Google Inc was clear. Not the long and winding road of formal charges and a potential fine for the world\u2019s most popular search engine, but the quicker route of a settlement.\n\nGoogle formally submitted its concessions to the European Commission last week, aiming to end the 30-month long case. The regulators said they would \u201cmarket test\u201d the proposals soon, indicating they were content with the offer.\n\nWhile the Commission, the EU\u2019s competition authority, and the U.S. company may be happy with the result, some of Google\u2019s rivals are not so convinced.\n\nThey see it as a missed opportunity by regulators to tackle what they regard as a dominant player determined to crush smaller rivals and thwart any chances they have to grow.\n\nFor his part, Almunia defends the approach he has taken, which was designed to secure a resolution of the case without having to prove guilt and adjudicate a fine.\n\nIn that way, consumers benefit more quickly from the resolution, rather than having to wait for years as in past EU cases against Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp.\n\n\u201cWe ... prefer to conclude cases swiftly when this brings the most benefits to the markets. In certain industries - such as high-tech and fast-moving markets - it is important that competition is restored quickly and effectively,\u201d the EU commissioner said earlier this month.\n\nAlmunia had been concerned that Google may have broken the rules by promoting its services over those of rivals, copying competitors\u2019 travel and restaurant reviews without permission and restricting advertisers from moving to competing services.\n\nIn trying to settle the case, the EU competition commissioner has a point, given the length of earlier proceedings against Microsoft and Intel, said Nicolas Petit, law professor at the University of Liege in Belgium.\n\n\u201cThe first Microsoft case took six years and even then the remedies were only applicable two years later. The Intel case took nine years from when the complaints were filed to the prohibition decision,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven the complexity of the EU case and the fact that U.S. regulators found no wrongdoing in their own investigation of Google\u2019s core search business, Almunia is just being pragmatic, said Edmon Oude Elferink at law firm CMS Derks Star Busmann.\n\n\u201cFrom the legal and strategic point of view, it\u2019s the thing to do. If a case is not clear-cut, going for a hardline approach is risky. The risk of losing face is very serious,\u201d he said, referring to the Commission\u2019s settlement procedure.\n\n\u201cArticle 9 is a comfortable road. The Commission can claim that it has dealt with the case without running too many risks.\u201d\n\nBut for lobbying group and Google complainant ICOMP, which counts Microsoft and four other rivals among its members, such arguments hold little water.\n\n\u201cThe complaints started to be made five years ago. Almunia should have issued a statement of objections two years ago,\u201d said ICOMP lawyer David Wood, referring to the documents spelling out the regulator\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to think why an Article 7 would not be more effective and quicker than an Article 9, even now.\u201d Article 7 decisions allow EU regulators to ban anti-competitive behavior and levy fines - as opposed to Article 9, under which companies can offer concessions to end an antitrust probe without any finding of wrongdoing.\n\nCritics may still demand a more extensive investigation into Google and time may not be on Almunia\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s mandate expires somewhere in the fall of 2014. Under an Article 7 procedure, he might no longer (be) ... in office to sign the prohibition decision,\u201d Petit said. \u201cIn short, to put the Google case on his hunt list, Almunia needed a settlement.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, drawbacks.\n\nSome say Almunia\u2019s eagerness to wrap up the case could eventually undermine antitrust law enforcement and also leave companies in the dark.\n\n\u201cFrom an antitrust policy perspective, it creates legal uncertainty, as the legal principles ... are not clear, neither for the parties, not for third parties,\u201d said Anne Vallery, a partner at law firm VVGB in Brussels.\n\nStill, there are more ways than one to go after technological companies suspected of flouting rules and blocking competition, said Albert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute think-tank.\n\n\u201cWhat is important to remember is that governments retain many tools (for example, procurement policies and privacy protection policies) with which they will be able to nudge, not only Google but the whole internet industry, in ways that appear to make sense even as the industry changes,\u201d Foer said.\n\n\u201cWe need to be thinking about additional ways to maintain competition in the field of search. A long perspective is needed.\u201d",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s core Internet business grew net revenue 23 percent in the first quarter, softening the effect of a sharp decline in its Motorola mobile phone division.\n\nShares of Google, which reached an all-time high of $844 in March, were up 1.5 percent to $777.75 in after hours trading on Thursday.\n\n\u201cGoogle eked out an acceptable quarter, but it wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jordan Rohan.\n\nHe noted that Google\u2019s adjusted profit of $11.58 per share benefited from a significantly lower tax rate due to a retroactive research and development tax credit. Without that benefit, Rohan said Google would have missed Wall Street\u2019s earnings target of $10.66 per share.\n\nThe world\u2019s No.1 Internet search engine, Google has stepped up efforts to adapt its business to a rapidly changing technology landscape in which consumers are increasingly accessing the Web using mobile devices instead of PCs.\n\nThe company\u2019s Android operating system has leaped past Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone and its iOS software to become the most popular smartphone software, used on more than 70 percent of devices, according to industry research firm Gartner.\n\nGoogle improved its cost-per-click, a critical metric that refers to the price advertisers pay the Internet search giant, in the first quarter. The CPC rate declined 4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, versus a 6 percent decline in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s classic Google. There\u2019s plenty of things to like and some things not to like,\u201d said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis.\n\nGoogle CEO Larry Page spent much of the conference call discussing new products such as the Google Glass wearable computers and high-speed fiber networks that the company is developing, which he said were vital to the company\u2019s future success.\n\n\u201cIf you look at most companies they never do anything different, and eventually they run into problems for that reason,\u201d said the 40-year-old Page, who co-founded Google in 1998 with Sergey Brin.\n\nHe said the new lineup of yet-to-be-released Motorola devices would offer a variety of improvements over current smartphones, with features such as longer battery life and better resistance to shattering or damage from spilled drinks.\n\nFor now however, the Motorola business continues to be a drag on Google\u2019s consolidated results, said Gillis of BGC Partners.\n\nRevenue at the Motorola business, which Google acquired for $12.5 billion in May 2012, declined to $1.02 billion in the first three months of the year, from $1.51 billion in the fourth quarter. The Motorola business posted an operating loss of $271 million in the first quarter.\n\nGoogle\u2019s main Internet business generated $9.99 billion in first-quarter net revenue, which excludes fees paid to partner websites, compared to $8.14 billion in the first quarter of 2012.\n\nSeven analysts polled by Reuters had yielded an average forecast of $9.78 billion.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing exceptional about the top line. But I think CPC rates are again incrementally a little bit better,\u201d said Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice, referring to Google\u2019s cost per click rates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s search ad rates have been under pressure as more consumers access its online services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, where advertising rates are lower than on PCs.\n\nIn February, Google changed the way marketers run ad campaigns on Google, blurring the distinction between ads destined for PCs and mobile ads, in a move that some analysts believe could help bolster Google\u2019s overall ad prices.\n\nGoogle also recently converted its shopping search feature to an all-advertising based system, in which retailers are required to buy ads featuring photos of their products in order to be included in the search results. More than one billion products are now listed, Google Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora said during the conference call.\n\nOverall first quarter net income, including its money-losing Motorola Mobility mobile phone business, was $3.35 billion or $9.94 per share. That compares with net income of $2.89 billion or $8.75 per share in the year-ago period, before Google acquired Motorola.\n\nConsolidated revenue in the first quarter was $13.97 billion, versus $10.65 billion in the year-ago period.",
