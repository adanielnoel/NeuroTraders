        "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia\u2019s anti-monopoly agency said on Monday Google Inc was abusing its market position in the country and would face penalties, in a case launched by local competitor Yandex .\n\nThe FAS anti-monopoly body said Google had violated the law by pre-installing certain applications on mobile devices and could face penalties totalling up to 15 percent of its 2014 revenue in this part of the Russian market.\n\nFAS declined to specify the revenue in question, saying it was a trade secret, but said it would decide on the exact value of the fine after Sept. 28. It added Google must then pay and change its ways, or risk more fines if violations continue.\n\nGoogle Russia said it would analyse the decision and declined further comment until then.\n\nShares in Yandex, which rivals Google as Russia\u2019s biggest internet search engine, rose as much as 9 percent before stabilising around 7 percent higher.\n\nYandex, which filed a complaint against Google with FAS in February, welcomed the decision.\n\n\u201cWe believe the FAS decision will serve to restore competition on the market,\u201d the company said.\n\nIt added the complaint included the practice of bundling applications from the Google Mobile Services with the Google Play store, requiring pre-installation of the Google search engine as the default one, and giving Google application icons preferential placement on the screen of mobile devices.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the investigation confirmed the existence of agreements on prohibition of pre-installation of competitors\u2019 apps,\u201d Yandex said.\n\nYandex is ahead of Google in Russia but has seen competition stiffen in mobile phones as consumers have adopted Android-based handsets that come pre-loaded with Google products that compete directly with Yandex applications.\n\nGoogle\u2019s total 2014 revenue stood at $66 billion. The company\u2019s website does not provide a separate revenue figure for Russia, or the exact segment involved in the case.\n\nAnalysts at App Annie say Russia was Google\u2019s No.4 market in the world in the second quarter of 2015 in terms of Google Play downloads.\n\nThe European Union is conducting its own anti-trust case against Google.

        "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German premium carmakers BMW (BMWG.DE), Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE) and Audi (NSUG.DE) are snapping up software experts as tech firms such as Google (GOOGL.O) threaten to outflank them in the race to develop a self-driving car.\n\nSoftware expertise has become a new battleground for automakers and tech firms as cars need lines of code to connect electric car motors to batteries, talk to smartphones or activate brakes when a radar system detects an obstacle ahead.\n\nWithout beefing up their digital expertise, German automakers will struggle to offer new premium features such as autonomous driving and car-sharing services to compete with new rivals such as Google and Uber [UBER.UL].\n\n\u201cWhat car companies are doing is hiring people generally from outside automotive. Some companies a few years ago didn\u2019t have a connected car department. They all have that now,\u201d said Malcolm Earp, chief executive at Magma People, a specialist automotive recruitment company said.\n\nIn August, BMW, Audi and Mercedes said they would pay about 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) to buy Nokia\u2019s maps business, beating out high-tech rivals for location services seen as key to the future of self-driving cars.\n\nIn September last year, Daimler bought Daimler bought mytaxi and RideScout, two smartphone applications that will help the maker of Mercedes-Benz limousines provide services to people who do not own cars.\n\nIn the latest example of cross-pollination between the tech and car sectors, Google named auto veteran John Krafcik, the former chief executive of Hyundai Motors America (005380.KS) as chief of its self-driving car project.\n\nThe tech focus for premium carmakers means that despite a general drive to cut costs and boost margins amid a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s largest car market, they are adding staff to stay in the digitization race.\n\nBMW\u2019s workforce rose 6.2 percent to 119,489 at the end of June, from 112,500 a year earlier. The Bavarian automaker said it will continue to recruit staff in 2015 to help \u201cthe advancement of new technologies, including the ever-increasing scale of digitalization\u201d.\n\nBavarian rival Audi, the premium brand owned by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), said its workforce had increased by 8 percent between January and June to 81,640 staff.\n\nAudi plans to add another 6,000 staff \u201cprimarily to support the development of pioneering technologies as well as for the expansion of our international sites\u201d.\n\nMercedes parent company Daimler said headcount rose 1.6 percent in the first half of the year to 284,441 and overall headcount will rise this year from 2014.\n\nThe Stuttgart-based maker of luxury cars and trucks remains on the lookout for expertise in data analysis.\n\nIn June, Daimler Trucks bought telematics provider Zonar Systems Inc. to help roll out satellite-based connectivity services for fleet operators such as remote diagnostics.\n\n\u201cThe automotive industry is facing a big disruption through connectivity and connected driving technologies. These features will become an important source of differentiation,\u201d said Andreas Tschiesner, head of McKinsey\u2019s automotive practice in Germany.",
