        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday released a patch to protect users of its Internet Explorer browser from attacks similar to those directed at Google Inc\u2019s operations in China last week.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software company, which said hackers targeting Google and at least 20 other companies in China exploited a weakness in its browser, said its new patch was \u201ccritical\u201d and people should apply it as soon as possible.\n\nOther hackers have begun to exploit the flaw, according to researchers with Symantec Corp, the world\u2019s biggest security software maker.\n\nSymantec has found viruses that take advantage of the weakness in Microsoft\u2019s browser on some 100 websites, security researcher John Harrison said on Thursday.\n\nThey are dangerous because they can infect the PC of any user who visits those sites. Unlike less powerful viruses, it is not necessary for people to download software for their machines to become infected, Harrison said.\n\nPCs are safe if they apply the patch, which resolves eight vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Microsoft said. The most serious could allow hackers to gain control of a computer remotely via Web sites people visit while using the browser.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re always working, we have fewer vulnerabilities\n\nthan our competitors,\u201d said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer at an energy conference in Houston, addressing cyber-security concerns.\n\nHe gave no indication that Microsoft would change its business in China after Google threatened to quit the country last week. \u201cWe respect the laws of China, it\u2019s the only appropriate thing for us to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe viruses Symantec has found only successfully attack Internet Explorer 6, though hackers could figure out how to break through the defenses of Internet Explorer 7 and 8, the most recent version of the software, Symantec\u2019s Harrison said.\n\nMost Internet Explorer customers, who have automatic updating enabled on their systems, will not need to take any action on the security patch, Microsoft said. For manual updating, it directed users to its website (here).",

        "body": "BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - EU regulators are seeking market views on whether a Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plan to use Yahoo Inc\u2019s search technology would help the U.S. software firm compete against dominant search engine Google Inc (GOOG.O). Microsoft struck a 10-year Web search partnership with Yahoo YHOO.O last July, seeking to challenge Google. Combining forces could also attract more ad dollars from marketers, but the deal has yet to be approved by antitrust regulators.\n\nAntitrust lawyers have said U.S. regulators are expected to scrutinise the deal closely but eventually grant approval as it would create a stronger rival to Google. [ID:nN29273592]\n\n\u201cWill the merger make Microsoft a better competitor to Google?\u201d the European Commission said in a questionnaire sent to interested parties and obtained by Reuters.\n\nThe 38-question document asked potential respondents whether they believed Google had a competitive advantage compared to other search engines and what they considered to be the advantages and disadvantages of the various services.\n\nThey were also asked whether the Microsoft/Yahoo deal would encourage innovation and lead to better searching. The deadline for comments is Jan. 29.\n\nThe European Union executive has given itself until Feb. 19 to clear or prohibit the deal. It could extend the review should it have competition concerns. Outgoing Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has to date blocked only two proposed mergers.\n\nMicrosoft last month ended a decade-long battle with the Commission by agreeing to give European consumers better access to rival Internet browsers in its Windows operating system.\n\nAntitrust infringements in Europe have led to fines against Microsoft totalling 1.68 billion euros ($2.4 billion).

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc was among the first technology companies to shake off the recession last year, but the Internet giant\u2019s fourth-quarter report could not satisfy investors\u2019 increasing demand for stronger growth.\n\nShares of Google fell about 4 percent after the leading Internet search provider posted a higher-than-expected profit but its revenue growth lagged some of Wall Street\u2019s most bullish expectations -- even though it was Google\u2019s strongest performance in a year.\n\nExpectations \u201dgot higher as they came closer to reporting and they delivered fundamentally sound numbers, but did not deliver a blowout,\u201c said Martin Pyykkonen, senior analyst at Janco Partners. \u201dI think the stock will recover. I don\u2019t think it will fall through the floor.\n\nGoogle, whose total revenue increased 17 percent from a year earlier to $6.67 billion, is the latest major tech firm to close out 2009 with improved financial results. Others include Intel Corp, International Business Machines Corp and eBay Inc.\n\nBut investors had sold off tech stocks to lock in profits this week, including that of IBM, which has risen roughly 10 percent in three months.\n\nGoogle\u2019s problems in China have also been an overhang on the stock, which is down about 12 percent since hitting a 52-week high in early January. The company said last week that it might have to close its China operations after a cyber attack and its decision to stop censoring search results.\n\nChief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a conference call on Thursday that the China business is unchanged but the company expects to make changes in a \u201creasonably short time from now.\u201d\n\nGoogle executives said on Thursday that the company would invest heavily in 2010 as it seeks to stay ahead in the search business that delivers the lion\u2019s share of its revenue and as it spends on initiatives to expand into new markets.\n\nGoogle is facing increasing competition from Microsoft Corp, which has struck a deal to provide Yahoo Inc\u2019s search technology. And Google\u2019s efforts to expand into the mobile phone market, including the recent move to sell the Nexus One smartphone directly to consumers, has put it in greater competition with Apple Inc.\n\nSchmidt said Google\u2019s \u201cbusiness structures\u201d with Apple were quite stable, but he declined to comment on media reports that Apple was in talks with Microsoft about replacing Google as the iPhone\u2019s search engine.\n\nSchmidt cited mobile as the business outside of search advertising that was most likely to deliver the sharpest growth on a percentage basis going forward, though he said display advertising represented the largest growth opportunity in absolute dollars.\n\nGoogle\u2019s fourth-quarter profit per share, excluding items, was $6.79, above the year-earlier period\u2019s $5.10 and beating analysts\u2019 average forecast of $6.48, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nNet revenue, which excludes the traffic acquisition costs Google paid to partners, rose 13 percent to $4.95 billion, which was at the low end of some estimates for 13 percent to 15 percent growth. The average forecast was $4.92 billion.\n\n\u201cEarnings were much ahead of expectations, but top-line fell slightly below expectations,\u201d said Sameet Sinha, analyst at JMP Securities. \u201cI think that is because cost per click was up about 2 percent sequentially, and we had been expecting closer to 5 percent growth.\u201d Cost per click is the price that advertisers pay Google when a Web surfer clicks on an ad.\n\nGoogle said its headcount increased to 19,835 employees in the quarter, reversing three quarters of declines. And the company said it spent more money on marketing campaigns during the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cSpending is always a wild card at Google,\u201d said Andy Miedler, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones. But he noted that Google \u201cproved their cost-cutting stripes\u201d during the downturn, and that any uptick in spending going forward will come as revenues rise.\n\nNet income was $1.97 billion, or $6.13 a share, in the three months ended December 31, compared with $382.4 million, or $1.21 a share, in the year-earlier period when the company took charges for its investments in AOL Inc and Clearwire Corp.\n\nTotal revenue at Google rose 17 percent to $6.67 billion. Revenue from outside the United States was 53 percent of the total. Google does not disclose the size of its business in China, where it lags home-grown search powerhouse Baidu Inc, but analysts peg Google\u2019s annual China revenue at between $200 million and $600 million.\n\nGoogle shares fell about 4 percent to $556.26 in after-hours trade following the earnings report.",

Prior to events, the Google engine could also deliver Rich Snippets related to people and reviews.",
