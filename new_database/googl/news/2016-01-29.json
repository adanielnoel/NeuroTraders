        "body": "LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators said on Thursday they would examine a complaint from the Scottish National Party (SNP) about Internet group Google\u2019s back tax deal with British tax authorities.\n\nThe 130 million pound ($185 million) settlement, announced on Friday, was hailed by the UK government as a major success but dismissed as \u201cderisory\u201d by the opposition Labour Party and criticized by other parties.\n\nThe European Commission itself took aim on Thursday at tax avoidance by multinationals, proposing that EU states be allowed to tax corporate profits at home in some circumstances even if the money has been transferred elsewhere to avoid such payments.\n\n\u201cSpecifically concerning Google\u2019s tax treatment in the UK, the Commission can confirm it has received a letter from a member of the Scottish National Party on this matter,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition enforcer said in an email.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will look at it and issues raised, as with all letters received from stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe letter calling for a probe was sent by SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie.\n\nTalking to Sky News, he said it was important \u201cproper investigations are carried out and she (European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager) can either give them a clean bill of health or not.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Vestager had told BBC radio she would examine Google\u2019s tax deal if she received a complaint.\n\n\u201cIf we find that there is something to be concerned about.

        "header": "Google wants Orrick sanctioned for disclosing Android profits, Apple payments",
        "body": "(Reuters) \u2013 The world learned a couple of very interesting facts last week about Google\u2019s Android operating system. Since its release, Android has generated about $31 billion in revenue and $22 billion in profit. Google meanwhile pays Apple big money \u2013 $1 billion in 2014 \u2013 to keep its search bar on the iPhone. Those previously unknown details of Google\u2019s finances, as my Reuters colleague Dan Levine has reported, became public via Oracle\u2019s epic litigation accusing Google of infringing its copyrights on Java application programming interfaces.\n\nThe information came out during a Jan. 14 hearing on a discovery dispute before U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu of San Francisco. Oracle lawyer Annette Hurst of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe, responding to a question from the judge and assertions by Google, disclosed the Google financial details, which subsequently made headlines when Bloomberg reporters got hold of the hearing transcript.\n\nNow Google wants Oracle and Orrick to be sanctioned for revealing confidential information produced under a protective order. On Wednesday, Google lawyers from King & Spalding filed a letter asking permission to move for a contempt finding and sanctions, arguing that \u201cself-serving\u201d disclosures by Oracle and Orrick \u201creveal a profound disregard for this court\u2019s protective order. Google and third parties have been harmed by this disclosure and are at risk of further harm from future improper disclosures.\u201d (Google\u2019s lead counsel in the Oracle case is Keker & Van Nest, but the sanction letter said Orrick has been a Keker client so only K&S signed the filing.)\n\nGoogle has been protesting the Orrick disclosures since the hearing itself. As the company explained in a Jan. 20 letter to Judge Ryu, Google lawyers moved immediately after Hurst revealed information about its agreement with Apple to redact and seal the hearing transcript. The magistrate denied Google\u2019s oral motion, but on Jan. 21, Google filed a formal motion to redact not only the Apple payment information but also disclosures about Android revenue and profits. (The company said it does not ordinarily break out Android finances.)\n\n\u201cHad Oracle provided Google with notice of its intent to disclose such confidential information \u2013 as the protective order requires and as has been the parties\u2019 past practice in this case \u2013 Google could have addressed this issue before the hearing,\u201d the motion said. \u201cBut, due to Oracle\u2019s failure to provide the notice \u007f Google has been forced to take immediate steps to limit the potential harmful impact of that disclosure by filing this motion. Google should not be punished for Oracle\u2019s intentional misconduct.\u201d\n\nOracle wasn\u2019t exactly apologetic in its response later that day. The company said it didn\u2019t take any position on whether the hearing transcript should be redacted and sealed, but pointed out that Google didn\u2019t object at the hearing to the revelation of Android financial information, so it shouldn\u2019t be permitted after the fact to seal those disclosures.\n\nMoreover, Oracle said, the protective order in the case allows both sides to disclose confidential information to the court, which is what happened at the hearing. Oracle wasn\u2019t expecting to reveal confidential financial statistics, the company said, but when the magistrate asked about Google\u2019s apportionment of profits, Oracle\u2019s lawyer, Hurst, answered the judge\u2019s question. Hurst only disclosed revenue details, Oracle said, to correct an assertion by Google\u2019s lawyer that the data was contained in deposition testimony.\n\nAs for the Apple payment revelation, Oracle said, obliquely, that Google was on notice that the \u201ceconomics of platform distribution\u201d might arise during the hearing. In a declaration accompanying Oracle\u2019s submission, Orrick partner Hurst said specifically that she informed Google lawyers at a meeting in December to discuss the Jan. 14 hearing that many of Oracle\u2019s remedy theories take into account Google\u2019s payments to third parties. She also noted that Google lawyers also disclosed confidential information at the hearing from Oracle experts.\n\nOracle\u2019s response provoked Google\u2019s sanction letter, which highlights Oracle\u2019s \u201crefusal to remedy the violations.\u201d Google said its proposed motion will seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with Oracle\u2019s supposed breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe hearing transcript is now under seal while the magistrate reconsiders her previous decision not to keep it under wraps.\n\nAs for the contempt letter, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, who is overseeing the case, said in an order Thursday that the matter would be postponed until after trial, which is scheduled to begin in May.\n\nFor more of my posts, please go to WestlawNext Practitioner Insights",

        "header": "Italian tax police believe Google evaded 227 million euros in taxes: sources",
        "body": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italy believes Google (GOOGL.O) evaded 227 million euros ($247.5 million) in taxes between 2009 and 2013 and could hit the U.S. Internet giant with hefty punitive fines, investigative sources said on Thursday.\n\nThe report by Italian finance police was due to be handed to Google later in the day and comes amid an increasingly angry debate across Europe over taxation of multinationals who park earnings in low-tax nations.\n\nAsked about the Italian report, a Google spokesperson said: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We are continuing to work with the relevant authorities.\u201d\n\nFinance police suspect that over a five-year period, Google failed to declare some 100 million euros of revenues in Italy which would have fallen into a 27 percent corporate tax bracket.\n\nIn addition, some 600 million euros of royalties should have been revealed to the tax authorities and would have faced a tax demand for some 200 million euros.\n\nA source said there was no agreement yet with Google on the issue and said the eventual sum requested of the U.S. company could be considerably higher once penalties and interest arrears were added.\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest figures show it paid 2.2 million euros of tax in Italy in 2014 on revenues of 54.4 million euros generated in the country. Italy\u2019s Communications Authority estimates Google\u2019s Italian revenues at around 10 times higher.\n\nLast week Google agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($185 million) in back taxes to the British authorities, though the opposition Labour Party and others said the sum was too small compared with the profits the company earned in Britain.\n\nIn December, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) agreed to pay Italy\u2019s tax office 318 million euros to settle a dispute over allegations it failed to pay taxes for six years, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nOn Thursday, the European Commission weighed into the row over taxation of multinationals with a proposal that would allow EU countries to tax corporate profits at home in some cases, even if the money had been transferred elsewhere.\n\nGoogle has based its regional headquarters in Dublin, where corporate tax rates are much lower than in Italy. The firm says its Italian presence merely provides consulting and marketing services for Google Ireland, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nEU tax law protects companies against paying tax in a country where they do not have what is termed a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters last September, a Google spokeswoman said the company was \u201cnaturally\u201d attracted by Ireland\u2019s relatively low corporate tax rate, as well as by the expansion prospects the country offered.\n\n\u201cIf governments don\u2019t like these laws they have the power to change them,\u201d she said.",

In addition, the company is close to displacing Apple Inc as the most valuable U.S. tech company.",
