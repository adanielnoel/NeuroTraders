        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - There are scores of eligible Google millionaires, but as of next month, both its famed billionaire founders appear to be taken.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, co-founder Larry Page will marry his girlfriend, Lucinda Southworth, at an undisclosed location during the weekend of December 8.\n\nGuests have been advised to have their passports available to travel internationally, the newspaper said.\n\nEarlier this month, Silicon Valley celebrity gossip site valleywag.com reported that the two would marry on Necker Island, the Caribbean hideaway owned by Virgin Group billionaire Richard Branson, on December 7.\n\nSince 2003, Southworth has been a doctoral student in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2001 and holds a master\u2019s of science from Oxford University.\n\nSouthworth did not respond to requests for comment. A Google spokesperson declined to confirm the engagement.\n\nPage, 34, co-founded the now famed search company in 1998 with Stanford University classmate Sergey Brin.\n\nSince the firm went public in 2004, its stock has skyrocketed to nearly $750 a share and it has become one of the world\u2019s most highly valued companies. Following a week of rocky trading, shares closed at $660.55, up 4.5 percent on Tuesday.\n\nPage and Brin were co-ranked at No. 5 this year in Forbes\u2019 400 list of U.S. billionaires. Each is estimated to have a net worth of $18.5 billion.\n\nIn May, Brin married his longtime girlfriend, Anne Wojcicki, on a sandbar in the Bahamas.",
