Page views are the way advertisers count online audience ad consumption.\n\nGoogle appears ready to make a frontal assault on a mobile industry where network operators call the shots about what features appear on phones on their networks. This could one day make Google a major mobile player, but it will take time. Google risks being distracted by technology rather than being focused on advertising revenue, the lifeblood of both Internet players, Boerries said.\n\nYahoo offers an online search that makes it easier for phone subscribers to discover Web services. It sees handset deals as enablers of its strategy to strike deals with network operators on ad-supported services.\n\nInvestors, however, seem transfixed by the prospect that Google is ready to dominate the mobile Internet the way it already does the computer-based Web, and have pushed its shares to record levels just off $750.\n\nMeanwhile, Yahoo shares are down 11 percent at $27.90 this week, and have been range-bound for more than a year over strategy missteps in the non-mobile parts of its business.\n\nDespite the share reaction, analysts say it is far too early to bank on Google winning over the mobile market like it did for computer-based Web search.\n\n\u201cI have yet to be convinced that Google\u2019s mobile strategy will create a big dent in the industry,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Jordan Rohan, who added that Yahoo appears right to focus on distribution deals of its services instead.\n\nThe first phones based on Google\u2019s mobile software, dubbed \u201cAndroid,\u201d are not due to appear until the second half of 2008. Google signed 33 initial partners, with Deutsche Telekom\u2019s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile network operator and Taiwanese handset maker High Tech Computer Corp (2498.TW) so far the only ones committed to offering some phones next year.\n\nYahoo already has deals to feature a package of services like search, e-mail and mapping on limited handsets from major phone makers, including Nokia NOK1V.HE, Motorola MOT.N, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), LG Electronics (066570.KS) and HTC -- every top name except Sony Ericsson.\n\nCarrier partners include Vodafone (VOD.L) in Britain and Hutchison Whampoa\u2019s 0013.HK 3 across Europe, and a recent far-reaching deal Web search and advertising deal with Spain\u2019s Telefonica (TEF.MC) that covers 100 million users in several European countries and much of the Latin American region.\n\nYahoo has also signed advertising deals with six operators across Southeast Asia and India. North Asia is next.\n\nIt has been in talks with operators in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Malaysia -- markets that boast some of the highest mobile penetration rates -- for new service tie-ups, President Susan Decker said on a tour of Asia last month.\n\nBoerries said Google will face complicated negotiations with phone carriers over sharing revenue from new phones.\n\nHe says he can\u2019t make the math work for any scenario where Google would use advertising to subsidize both a new phone and the monthly service fees carriers charge.\n\n\u201cWhatever money Google is going to make on advertising it is likely to pay in subsidies to the carriers,\u201d he predicts.\n\nIf Google were to succeed in its mission to make a truly open phone that other Internet services can run on, Boerries said there is nothing stopping Yahoo from using Google phones to push its own services.\n\n\u201cIf \u2018Android\u2019 is truly open source, we can take everything out there,\u201d Boerries said of the outside possibility Yahoo might use Google phone software and run Yahoo services over the devices. \u201cNothing prevents me from taking it,\u201d he said.",
