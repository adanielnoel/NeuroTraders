        "body": "(Reuters) - Internet giant Google\u2019s January 12 threat to quit China, citing cyber attacks and tightening censorship, could add to strains between Beijing and the United States, already at odds over currency, trade and Taiwan.\n\nWith the two giant nations joined at the hip economically, Sino-U.S. tensions are unlikely to escalate into outright confrontation, but could make cooperating on global economic and security issues all the more difficult.\n\nHere are the main sources of tension:\n\nThe United States complains that China keeps its currency artificially undervalued, thus giving its exporters an unfair advantage.\n\nChina has unofficially pegged its currency to the dollar since mid-2008, meaning its currency has weakened against other trade partners as the value of the dollar has slid.\n\nBeijing is concerned the value of its dollar holdings could be eroded by massive debt issuances to fund the U.S. stimulus.\n\nChina held $798.9 billion in U.S. Treasuries at end-October, displacing Japan in September 2008 as the largest foreign holder.\n\nChina is requesting the World Trade Organization open a dispute panel over U.S. duties on tires, after the United States for the first time imposed safeguard duties China had agreed to when it joined the WTO.\n\nOther trade disputes center around steel products, poultry, Chinese tariffs on raw materials exports, and quality and safety concerns over Chinese-made food, toys and other goods that Chinese manufacturers view as a type of protectionism.\n\nU.S. firms investing in China complain about intellectual property theft, murky regulations, corruption and unfair advantages enjoyed by domestic rivals.\n\nChina complains about investment barriers on the U.S. side, citing resource investments blocked on national security grounds.\n\nIn 2008, U.S. exports to China totaled $69.7 billion, but were dwarfed by $337.8 billion in exports from China to the United States, now Beijing\u2019s second biggest trade partner.\n\nAs China has grown to the world\u2019s third largest economy it is gaining greater clout, especially in Asia and Africa.\n\nIt is also upgrading its military and space capability, and Washington has said Beijing should be more open about its defense spending and strategic intentions.\n\nChina, however, remains wary of the United States\u2019 global military dominance. U.S. patrols in waters China considers its exclusive zone led to minor incidents last year. In 2001 a U.S. spy plane was forced to land in China after colliding with a Chinese fighter.\n\nChina hosts stalled six-party talks seeking to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. But China has also sought to bolster bilateral tries with North Korea.\n\nWashington wants China\u2019s stronger cooperation in pressuring North Korea, as well as Iran, over their nuclear activities.\n\nTaiwan also remains a sore point. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring self-ruled and democratic Taiwan, which it considers its sovereign territory, under its rule. The United States says it has an obligation to help the island defend itself, and its weapons sales to Taiwan have drawn growing ire from Beijing.\n\nU.S. Internet firms have fared poorly in China, which censors content and blocks many foreign websites, including popular social media such as Twitter and Facebook.\n\nOn January 12, Google announced it was no longer willing to continue censoring Internet search results in China, and might pull out of the country party because of cyber attacks on its corporate infrastructure.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday called on China to openly and thoroughly investigate the cyber attacks and made a broad case for Internet freedom, arguing in part that nations that censor may ultimately crimp their growth.\n\n\u201cWe stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas,\u201d said Clinton in a major address that cited China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt among countries that censored the Internet or harassed bloggers.\n\nAmerican corporations and military strategists are increasingly concerned over skilled attacks by Chinese hackers, which they fear threaten corporate and national security.",

        "body": "Google\u2019s revenue and profits grew in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 2009, and exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations, capping a year in which the search company did well despite the global economic turmoil.\n\nGoogle had revenue of US$6.67 billion, up 17 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Subtracting the commissions Google pays to its ad-network partners, revenue was $4.95 billion, topping the $4.92 billion analyst consensus expectation.\n\nNet income came in at $1.97 billion, or $6.13 per share, compared to $382 million, or $1.21 per share, in the same period last year. On a pro forma basis, which excludes certain one-time items, net income was $2.19 billion, or $6.79 per share, compared to $1.62 billion, or $5.10 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Analyst consensus had been for earnings per share of $6.50 on a pro forma basis.\n\nGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt expressed satisfaction with the results after what he called \u201ca roller-coaster year,\u201d referring to the world\u2019s economic crisis. \u201cThis was a very strong quarter for Google,\u201d he said during a conference call.\n\nHe credited the company\u2019s business model and staff, specifically the management, product and engineering teams, for the success.\n\nGoogle, which makes most of its money from search advertising, will see significant revenue boosts this year from its emerging mobile, enterprise and display advertising businesses, Schmidt predicted.\n\nThe company is likely to acquire one company per month to boost its technology development efforts and beef up its staff, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the Q4 results and that gives us the confidence to turn our focus to the growth opportunities,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette.\n\nAsked about the Chinese hack against Google and the company\u2019s plan to possibly exit China, Schmidt said Google is in conversations with the Chinese government and expressed hope that Google can remain in the country.\n\n\u201cWe wish to remain in China. We like the Chinese people, we like our Chinese employees, we like the business opportunities there,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to do that on somewhat different terms than we have, but we remain quite committed to being there.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, Google continues to censor its search results in China, but that could change soon, he said. As a result of the China-originated hack against Google servers, Google said last week it plans to stop censoring search results in the country, even if it means shutting down its business there.\n\nIn display advertising, where Google remains a minor player, Schmidt predicted big advances this year, and reiterated that \u201cthe next huge business for us is display\u201d and that YouTube is an essential part of that strategy.\n\nSchmidt also predicted significant increases in mobile revenue and praised the opportunities in the enterprise market, thanks to what he perceives as continued acceptance by businesses of the cloud computing model.\n\nGoogle-owned sites generated 66 percent of the total revenue, while ad-network partner sites generated the rest.\n\nPaid clicks, which are ads on which users clicked, thus generating a fee for Google, increased 13 percent compared with 2008\u2019s fourth quarter. The average value of clicks rose 5 percent.\n\nGoogle ended 2009 with $24.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, and a staff of 19,835 full-time employees, 170 more than in 2009\u2019s third quarter.",

        "body": "BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - When Google threw down the gauntlet to China\u2019s Internet censors, it also challenged the loyalties of the nation\u2019s wired generation.\n\nThese tech-savvy Chinese in their 20s and 30s grew up in far greater affluence and openness than their parents. Many are pulled between patriotic pride and a yearning for more say over their own lives, even if they accept Communist Party control.\n\nThe Google dispute may become a telling test of how they balance loyalties to their country with their desire for unfettered expression and access to information, and this response could shape how Beijing handles the dispute.\n\n\u201cThe special feature of the Internet is that companies like Google see that expanding their profits is tied to expanding their freedom,\u201d said Chen Yongmiao, a Chinese activist whose own website has been restricted by authorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a test. How much you support Google in China shows how much you want more freedom in China, even if you know Google is ultimately about profits.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest search engine said last week it could pull back from China and shut its Chinese Google.cn website over complaints of hacking and censorship. [ID:nSGE60C01H]\n\nChinese officials have avoided directly taking on Google, but made plain they expect Internet companies in the country to enforce the laws, including censorship. [ID:nTOE60I081]\n\nThe centre of the resulting tug-of-war in attitudes is the Zhongguancun area in northwest Beijing, an area dense with university campuses, malls of high-tech goods and computer labs, and also home to Google\u2019s China headquarters.\n\nStudents, job-seekers and high-tech professionals in Zhongguancun saw Google\u2019s stance through a prism of admiration and wariness that has echoed in online forums.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s admirable for a company to sacrifice profits for the sake of an idea,\u201d said Liu Wei, a 29-year-old accountant with heavy Clark Kent-style spectacles and neatly cropped hair.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we criticize our own government if we want to? Why can\u2019t we choose what we read on the Internet?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because China\u2019s different!\u201d interrupted his girlfriend Sun Jingying, a slight 26-year-old studying to become a chartered accountant.\n\n\u201cThere are some things about this country we just have to accept,\u201d she added, nonetheless stressing she would be sad if Google quit China. \u201cI\u2019d love to work for them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Obama administration has shown it wants to court this emerging generation of connected Chinese. China\u2019s latest survey of Internet use found 60.4 percent of the nation\u2019s online population of 384 million was aged 10 to 29.\n\nDuring his visit to China last November, President Barack Obama used a web-cast meeting with Chinese youth to amplify that message, telling them he was a \u201cbig supporter of not restricting Internet use\u201d. [ID:nPEK158853]\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is set to take on China and other authoritarian governments over Internet restrictions in a speech on Thursday. [ID:nN12211882]\n\nDespite censorship, China\u2019s Internet can be a potent public forum, with bloggers and amorphous online groups hectoring the government over pollution and corruption.\n\nLast year, the government abruptly abandoned a plan to force all new personal computers to come with a copy of \u201cGreen Dam\u201d Internet-filtering software that had been derided by online critics as intrusive and ineffective. [ID:nSP514751]\n\nBut China\u2019s youth can also bristle at what they see as Western bullying. The ruling Communist Party could seek to channel that volatile sentiment to blunt foreign pressure over control of the Internet.\n\n\u201cThere are some who feel increasingly restricted and unfree, the ones who tend to support Google. But there are also many who have been heavily shaped by the official media and see the U.S. government behind Google\u2019s actions,\u201d Li Yonggang, an expert on society and the Internet at Nanjing University in east China, said of the nation\u2019s \u201cpost-80\u201d generation.\n\n\u201cIf this becomes a more open fight between the Chinese and U.S. governments, this nationalism could come to dominate if the government turns harder line.\u201d\n\nChengfu Street in Zhongguancun, where Google has its China headquarters, is testament to the country\u2019s economic upheaval.\n\nA little over a decade ago, this was a gritty neighbourhood of low brick homes and cheap restaurants near retreating farmland.\n\nNow it bristles with high-tech offices and cafes and restaurants catering to office workers and students. Google\u2019s office sits in steel and glass towers that also house a Deutsche Bank office, a gym and \u201cWall Street English\u201d classrooms.\n\nThe students on nearby campuses who fill many high-tech jobs in this area, however, are also products of an education that prizes pride in the nation\u2019s achievements, obedience to the Communist Party, and vigilance against foreign pressure.\n\nMany of them had scant understanding that Google has said China was the source of sophisticated hacking -- China\u2019s state-run media has reported little on that complaint -- and others scoffed that Google would leave the country over the issue.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t handle hackers and censorship, that\u2019s their own problem,\u201d said one Chinese computer hardware technician heading for a gym workout near the Google office. He gave his English name, Derek Huang.\n\n\u201cEach country has its own Internet restrictions, so it\u2019s natural for us to have our own, and if we want to change them, that\u2019s our own business,\u201d he said.\n\nRecent opinion surveys show that while Chinese in their 20s and 30s are more critical of their government than older cohorts and want more freedom, they tend to be strongly patriotic and cautious about political change. The United States attracts both admiration and disdain.\n\nThe Internet was crucial in spreading Chinese anger about Western protests over Tibet before the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. In past years, too, the Internet has been a conduit of nationalist Chinese ire over Japan.\n\n\u201cGoogle was just acting out of commercial interests,\u201d said Su Xin, a 25-year-old graduate student of aeronautic engineering. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to accept some restrictions [on the Internet] for the sake of stability.\u201d\n\nBut even some students who said they had little interest in politics said they felt jolted by the idea that Google could quit China over censorship complaints.\n\n\u201cIf it leaves, I\u2019ll feel it\u2019s a big loss,\u201d said Guo Xin, a 19-year-old student with a spike of hair dyed neon-orange. He said he used the Internet, and Google, to hunt down information about online games and movies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good restricting us too much. It cuts us off from the information you need in modern life,\u201d he said.",

Why can\u2019t we choose what we read on the Internet?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because China\u2019s different!\u201d interrupted his girlfriend Sun Jingying, a slight 26-year-old studying to become a chartered accountant.\n\n\u201cThere are some things about this country we just have to accept,\u201d she added, nonetheless stressing she would be sad if Google quit China. \u201cI\u2019d love to work for them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Obama administration has shown it wants to court this emerging generation of connected Chinese. China\u2019s latest survey of Internet use found 60.4 percent of the nation\u2019s online population of 384 million was aged 10 to 29.\n\nDuring his visit to China last November, President Barack Obama used a web-cast meeting with Chinese youth to amplify that message, telling them he was a \u201cbig supporter of not restricting Internet use.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is set to take on China and other authoritarian governments over Internet restrictions in a speech on Thursday.\n\nDespite censorship, China\u2019s Internet can be a potent public forum, with bloggers and amorphous online groups hectoring the government over pollution and corruption.\n\nLast year, the government abruptly abandoned a plan to force all new personal computers to come with a copy of \u201cGreen Dam\u201d Internet-filtering software that had been derided by online critics as intrusive and ineffective.\n\nBut China\u2019s youth can also bristle at what they see as Western bullying. The ruling Communist Party could seek to channel that volatile sentiment to blunt foreign pressure over control of the Internet.\n\n\u201cThere are some who feel increasingly restricted and unfree, the ones who tend to support Google. But there are also many who have been heavily shaped by the official media and see the U.S. government behind Google\u2019s actions,\u201d Li Yonggang, an expert on society and the Internet at Nanjing University in east China, said of the nation\u2019s \u201cpost-80\u201d generation.\n\n\u201cIf this becomes a more open fight between the Chinese and U.S. governments, this nationalism could come to dominate if the government turns harder line.\u201d\n\nChengfu Street in Zhongguancun, where Google has its China headquarters, is testament to the country\u2019s economic upheaval.\n\nA little over a decade ago, this was a gritty neighborhood of low brick homes and cheap restaurants near retreating farmland.\n\nNow it bristles with high-tech offices and cafes and restaurants catering to office workers and students. Google\u2019s office sits in steel and glass towers that also house a Deutsche Bank office, a gym and \u201cWall Street English\u201d classrooms.\n\nThe students on nearby campuses who fill many high-tech jobs in this area, however, are also products of an education that prizes pride in the nation\u2019s achievements, obedience to the Communist Party, and vigilance against foreign pressure.\n\nMany of them had scant understanding that Google has said China was the source of sophisticated hacking -- China\u2019s state-run media has reported little on that complaint -- and others scoffed that Google would leave the country over the issue.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t handle hackers and censorship, that\u2019s their own problem,\u201d said one Chinese computer hardware technician heading for a gym workout near the Google office. He gave his English name, Derek Huang.\n\n\u201cEach country has its own Internet restrictions, so it\u2019s natural for us to have our own, and if we want to change them, that\u2019s our own business,\u201d he said.\n\nRecent opinion surveys show that while Chinese in their 20s and 30s are more critical of their government than older cohorts and want more freedom, they tend to be strongly patriotic and cautious about political change. The United States attracts both admiration and disdain.\n\nThe Internet was crucial in spreading Chinese anger about Western protests over Tibet before the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. In past years, too, the Internet has been a conduit of nationalist Chinese ire over Japan.\n\n\u201cGoogle was just acting out of commercial interests,\u201d said Su Xin, a 25-year-old graduate student of aeronautic engineering. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to accept some restrictions for the sake of stability.\u201d\n\nBut even some students who said they had little interest in politics said they felt jolted by the idea that Google could quit China over censorship complaints.\n\n\u201cIf it leaves, I\u2019ll feel it\u2019s a big loss,\u201d said Guo Xin, a 19-year-old student with a spike of hair dyed neon-orange. He said he used the Internet, and Google, to hunt down information about online games and movies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good restricting us too much. It cuts us off from the information you need in modern life,\u201d he said.",

He declined to say whether the LePhone would include Google\u2019s popular search feature, but said the handset would come pre-installed with the icons of major Chinese websites operated by Sina.com, Sohu.com and Tencent.\n\nLenovo also expects its handset business to grow faster than its traditional PC business, said Yang, without specifying a timeframe.\n\n\u201cI hope that Lenovo\u2019s mobile division can earn similar status as our PC business in the future,\u201d said Yang.\n\nLenovo sold off its handset business in 2008 to focus on its core PC business.\n\nBut as handsets and PCs have started to converge with the advent of devices such as netbooks and smartphones, Lenovo announced last November that it would reacquire the business for $200 million.",

        "body": "Just as Google Docs makes collaborating on documents via the Web easier than Microsoft Office does, Box.Net enables corporate workers to share documents and other files more easily and beyond firewalls than Microsoft SharePoint.\n\nBox.net\u2019s killer feature, along with its \u201cfreemium\u201d business model, has enabled the cloud content management startup to serve up more than billion files to 3.5 million users, including those at 50,000 businesses, CEO Aaron Levie said.\n\nLike Google , however, Box.net has neither made a major dent in Microsoft\u2019s business, nor reaped a financial windfall. The number of paying business customers is \u201cin the pretty high thousands,\u201d with only a tiny handful buying licenses for the entire organization, Levie said.\n\nBox.net and Google were comrades-in-arms in the struggle to unseat Redmond. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job of replacing Microsoft Exchange, we do a good job of replacing SharePoint,\u201d said Jen Grant, vice-president of marketing for Box.net.\n\nNow, the two are also competitors. Google announced last week that users of Docs and its paid counterpart Google Apps will soon be able to store any type of file on its platform.\n\nTo stay ahead of Microsoft and Google and other competitors, Box.net announced two new features on Wednesday.\n\nThe first is a time-saving document viewer built into Box.net. The feature converts documents into Flash files that users who can easily skim or view, instead of having to download onto their desktop to open with Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop or Windows Media Player.\n\nThe variety of file types supported by Box.net is wide: Microsoft Office, including the .docx and .xlsx of Microsoft Office Open XML, OpenOffice, images stored as JPEGs, GIFs, TIFFs and more, MP3 songs, FLV Flash videos, and even Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator files. Box.net is even working on adding support for CAD files.\n\nUsers can view the files at full-screen resolution and even print them, though the resolution may not be as sharp as the original document, Levie said.\n\nBox.net can also collect statistics on who has viewed the document and how many times. It cannot, however, collect those stats if the document is downloaded and edited by a desktop app such as Microsoft Office, or a via Box.net partner app such as Zoho Office.\n\nAnother new feature is the ability for users to easily embed links to the documents stored on Box.net on any Web page or site.\n\nTo appease enterprises, Box.net expects to win the SAS-70 data security certification in February.\n\nWhile Levie grants that Google has the engineering prowess to easily add its own document viewing feature, he argues it\u2019s low on its priorities.\n\n\u201cGoogle is not focused on content. They don\u2019t have an admin console, no reporting on who is sharing what, no workflow or collaboration features in their shared folders. That\u2019s where we sit apart,\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s SharePoint, even its SharePoint Online version, remains a complicated option for those focused on quick file collaboration with people outside of their company, Levie said.\n\nLarry Hawes, an analyst with Gilbane Group, says Tthat may be true andhe likes Box.net\u2019s new improvements, but he\u2019s not ready to call Box.net a SharePoint killer yet.\n\n\u201cBox.net is a good alternative to SharePoint for file-sharing, but SharePoint is so feature-rich, there are so many things that Box.net doesn\u2019t attempt to do,\u201d Hawes said.\n\nEric Lai covers Windows and Linux, desktop applications, databases and business intelligence for Computerworld .

Others include Intel Corp (INTC.O), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O).\n\nBut investors had sold off tech stocks to lock in profits this week, including that of IBM, which has risen roughly 10 percent in three months.\n\nGoogle\u2019s problems in China have also been an overhang on the stock, which is down about 12 percent since hitting a 52-week high in early January. The company said last week that it might have to close its China operations after a cyber attack and its decision to stop censoring search results.\n\nChief Executive Eric Schmidt said on Thursday that the China business is unchanged but the company expects to make changes in a \u201creasonably short time from now.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s fourth-quarter profit per share, excluding items, was $6.79, above the year-earlier period\u2019s $5.10 and beating analysts\u2019 average forecast of $6.48, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nNet revenue, which excludes the traffic acquisition costs Google paid to partners, rose 13 percent to $4.95 billion, which was at the low end of some estimates for 13 percent to 15 percent growth. The average forecast was $4.92 billion.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to signs that Google was ramping up spending as a possible cause for concern, but said that overall the company continued to dominate the Internet search market and delivered a strong quarterly report that fell short of only Wall Street\u2019s most bullish forecasts.\n\nOther analysts pointed to a disappointing 2 percent sequential rise in average cost per click, which is the price advertisers pay Google when Web surfers click on an ad.\n\n\u201cEarnings were much ahead of expectations, but top-line fell slightly below expectations,\u201d said Sameet Sinha, analyst at JMP Securities. \u201cI think that is because cost per click was up about 2 percent sequentially, and we had been expecting closer to 5 percent growth.\u201d\n\nGoogle, the world\u2019s No. 1 search engine, said its headcount increased to 19,835 employees in the quarter, reversing three consecutive quarters of declines. And the company said it expected to continue to make significant capital expenditures.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2010, we remain hugely optimistic about the Internet and are continuing to invest heavily in technological innovation for the benefit not only of our users and customers, but also the wider Web,\u201d said Schmidt in a statement.\n\nHe said on a conference call that he expects Google to continue to make an average of one acquisition a month, and saw the mobile business providing the fastest revenue growth outside of search on a percentage basis in 2010.\n\nNet income was $1.97 billion, or $6.13 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with $382.4 million, or $1.21 a share, in the year-earlier period when the company took charges for its investments in AOL Inc AOL.N and Clearwire Corp CLWR.O.\n\nTotal revenue at Google rose 17 percent to $6.67 billion. Revenue from outside the United States was 53 percent of the total.

They are down 8 percent since hitting a 52-week high of $629.51 on the first trading day of 2010.\n\n\u201cThe buy side is looking for pretty strong results on the quarter,\u201d said Kaufman Brothers analyst Aaron Kessler. He noted that the unofficial \u201cwhisper\u201d numbers among investors have Google\u2019s fourth-quarter net revenue growing between 13 percent and 15 percent from the third quarter\u2019s $4.38 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s slightly better than the 12.3 percent sequential growth expected on average, which pegs Google\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue at $4.92 billion, excluding traffic acquisition costs. Estimates from Thomson Reuters StarMine, which places more weight on recent forecasts by top-rated analysts, also forecast revenue of $4.92 billion.\n\nGoogle, which beat Wall Street EPS forecasts in each of 2009\u2019s first three quarters, has weathered the recession and ad spending slump better than many of its peers, even as its once-supercharged growth suffered a sharp slowdown.\n\nBut while other Internet companies like Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and AOL Inc AOL.N are still looking for light at the end of the tunnel, Google regained its momentum in the third quarter with a better-than-expected earnings report that sent its shares up 3.7 percent the following day.\n\nWhile Google\u2019s share price doubled in 2009, JMP Securities analyst Sameet Sinha said he believed it could keep rising in 2010 as the economy recovers and Google expands its footprint in different types of advertising such as graphical, display ads and affiliate networking.\n\n\u201cAs people get more visibility in 2010, I think there\u2019s room for the stock to continue going up,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle is expected to post $6.50 in fourth-quarter earnings per share, excluding special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. StarMine SmartEstimates said Google should earn $6.52 per share in the December quarter.\n\nGoogle\u2019s decision to stop self-censoring its search results in China, and to potentially shut down operations in the country, is of little financial consequence in the short term. Analysts estimate annual revenue from China of $200 million to $600 million. [ID:nLDE60I1DQ]\n\nBut executives\u2019 comments on the potential to reach a compromise with Beijing, and their strategy for international expansion outside of China, will be closely watched by investors worried about longer-term growth prospects.\n\nOn Monday, the company postponed the launch of two mobile phones in the country, manufactured by Motorola Inc MOT.N and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), in the first sign that its business there is starting to take a hit.\n\nWhile Google has been reluctant to share details about its operations outside its core Internet business, analysts and investors are expected to press for more information.\n\nThe analysts will \u201chave an opportunity to get some direct answers on these things at Google right now that are very topical,\u201d said portfolio manager Ryan Jacob of Jacob Internet Fund which owns Google stock.\n\nMore immediately, the fourth quarter may provide further signs of improvement in Google\u2019s cost per click -- the price advertisers pay Google when Web surfers click on an ad -- which could increase 4 percent year-over-year after losing ground for several quarters, according to a recent UBS note.\n\nWhile Google CEO Eric Schmidt has signaled that spending and hiring could soon increase, Jacob said the company would continue to manage costs judiciously, \u201cmagnifying\u201d the effect of revenue growth.\n\n\u201cEven a very modest exceeding of expectations on the top line could show a much larger increase in earnings,\u201d Jacob said.\n\nBut investors will be most eager for insight into Google\u2019s expansion plans in China and in the mobile phone market.\n\nGoogle\u2019s plan to sell its new Nexus One smartphone directly to consumers isn\u2019t likely to juice the company\u2019s revenue in the near term, analyst said.

        "header": "Nokia hopes to outdo Google with phone voice nav",
        "body": "Nokia today announced free turn-by-turn voice navigation for all its GPS-enabled smartphones globally, starting with 10 models today, and signaled a clear battle with Google over similar free technology now available in the U.S.\n\nA Nokia executive said in a telephone briefing that the free service will outdo Google and others partly because it will be offered in 74 countries and in 46 languages. \u201cThis is a global move, unlike companies that serve one country and one language,\u201d said Tero Ojanpera, Nokia\u2019s executive vice president of services on the call.\n\nGoogle announced Google Maps Navigation for the Android 2.0 operating system in October and its free voice navigation service turned up on Droid smartphones and other Android handsets -- to the delight of reviewers and users in the U.S.\n\nOjanpera said that Nokia\u2019s navigation service is 10 times more efficient that Google Maps, which relieves network congestion, something that wireless operators and users will appreciate. \u201cGoogle needs to load a bit map every time you move, but it\u2019s very efficient to use our technology by 10 times, which means networks are less congested,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen hundreds of millions are using this, this becomes a critical advantage.\u201d\n\nNokia uses a hybrid technology based on vector graphics plus a combination of pre-loaded and online maps from Navteq, which requires only a fraction of the bandwidth of the bitmap technology in Google Maps and other approaches, he said. In one example, he said traffic updates received over a 12 mile stretch of highway would require only 200KB of data be sent to a Nokia device wirelessly, compared to 2MB for an Android phone using Google Maps.\n\nNokia wants to increase the popularity of navigation and location services on phones, and its basic strategy is to \u201clead the market in mobile maps, navigation and location-based services,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nNokia sells far more mobile phones than other manufacturers globally, but hasn\u2019t done well in the U.S. and is viewed by some analysts as lagging with smartphone innovations.\n\nNokia\u2019s announcement will \u201cboost the uptake of navigation in general and will help Nokia\u2019s beleaguered position in the smartphone market,\u201d ABI Research said in a short statement.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, Nokia\u2019s free navigation is potentially even more disruptive than Google\u2019s free offer,\u201d said Dominique Bonte, an ABI analyst. He noted that free Google navigation is just on some Android phones in the U.S., but Nokia\u2019s offer will roll out globally on a large number of smartphones. The use of Navteq digital maps and proven navigation software with Nokia\u2019s Ovi Maps will \u201cmake it very difficult\u201d for competitors to beat.\n\nThe research firm Canalys says that about 163 million smartphones had integrated GPS in 2009, of which 51% were made by Nokia. About 27 million people used GPS navigation on phones in 2009, Canalys said, and Nokia believes it can increase that number to 50 million.\n\nLocation services have been eyed by carriers and manufacturers of GPS-ready phones for years, and one of the biggest untapped markets is expected to come from advertising. Location services can enable users to search for a nearby shopping district or restaurant with GPS and then be fed short ads or even retail logos to direct them to a specific store that interests them.\n\nThe free navigation tool from Nokia uses Ovi Maps and is available for download today for 10 Nokia smartphones, including the N97 mini, Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and the Nokia E72, with more to be added in coming weeks, Nokia said. Current owners of compatible smartphones can download the new version of Ovi Maps for free from www.nokia.com/maps .\n\nStarting in March, new Nokia GPS-enabled smartphones will come preloaded with the new Ovi Maps version that has local country map data. Access to Lonely Planet and Michelin travel guides will also come for free. Ovi Maps covers more than 180 countries, but the car and pedestrian navigation is provided for 74 countries in 46 languages.\n\nAnalysts said Nokia\u2019s move will hurt traditional GPS companies such as TomTom, and TomTom\u2019s stock prices dipped by 12% on trading in Amsterdam, according to reports.\n\nMatt Hamblen covers mobile and wireless, smartphones and other handhelds, and wireless networking for Computerworld .

I don\u2019t think it will fall through the floor.\n\nOther analysts pointed to a disappointing 2 percent sequential rise in average cost per click, which is the price advertisers pay Google when Web surfers click on an ad.\n\n\u201cEarnings were much ahead of expectations, but top-line fell slightly below expectations,\u201d said Sameet Sinha, analyst at JMP Securities. \u201cI think that is because cost per click was up about 2 percent sequentially, and we had been expecting closer to 5 percent growth.\u201d\n\nGoogle, the world\u2019s No. 1 search engine, said its headcount increased to 19,835 employees in the quarter, reversing three consecutive quarters of declines. And the company said it expected to continue to make significant capital expenditures.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2010, we remain hugely optimistic about the Internet and are continuing to invest heavily in technological innovation for the benefit not only of our users and customers, but also the wider Web,\u201d said Schmidt in a statement.\n\nHe said on a conference call that he expects Google to continue to make an average of one acquisition a month, and saw the mobile business providing the fastest revenue growth outside of search on a percentage basis in 2010.\n\nNet income was $1.97 billion, or $6.13 a share, in the three months ended December 31, compared with $382.4 million, or $1.21 a share, in the year-earlier period when the company took charges for its investments in AOL Inc and Clearwire Corp.\n\nTotal revenue at Google rose 17 percent to $6.67 billion. Revenue from outside the United States was 53 percent of the total. Google does not disclose the size of its business in China, where it lags home-grown search powerhouse Baidu Inc, but analysts peg Google\u2019s annual China revenue at between $200 million and $600 million.\n\nGoogle shares fell about 4 percent to $556.75 in after-hours trade.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s threat to quit China over cyber attacks and censorship highlights U.S. fears that a more powerful Beijing is tapping government and corporate computer networks to steal secrets and to prepare for potential conflicts.\n\nTies between the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, and China, a rising rival, are already strained by jockeying for resources, regional influence, currency exchange rate advantages, trade protectionism charges and arms sales to Taiwan, among other things.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies for years have warned government officials and corporations that Chinese hackers have been piercing sensitive networks and preparing for any clash as bilateral ties wax and wane.\n\nOutsourcing, a cost-cutting strategy adopted by many U.S. companies, contributes to the cyber threat, according to Larry Wortzel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an advisory panel to Congress.\n\n\u201cCompanies that locate their research and development in China and employ Chinese citizens to work on their software have probably made Chinese intelligence and security services better at computer hacking,\u201d said Wortzel, a former U.S. Army attach\u00e9 in Beijing.\n\n\u201cThey learn the holes in the system and the codes to access programs to do software updates -- trapdoors that leave the U.S. vulnerable to attack,\u201d he said in an email interview.\n\nMoving hardware, chip and server production to China \u201cgives Chinese employees or security organizations opportunities to embed their own code and trapdoors into the hardware as they put the code in,\u201d Wortzel said.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton was scheduled to deliver on Thursday what was being billed as a major speech on Internet freedom. \u201cThe ability to operate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy,\u201d said Kurt Campbell, the department\u2019s top official for East Asia.\n\nGoogle owns the world\u2019s most popular Internet search engine. It jolted U.S.-China ties with its January 12 announcement that it had faced a \u201chighly sophisticated and targeted attack\u201d in mid-December allegedly from inside China.\n\nTargeted at the same time, Google said, were more than 20 other companies in finance, technology, media and chemicals. At issue, it said, was more than a simple security breach, though Google said a primary target was dissidents\u2019 email accounts.\n\nThe U.S. State Department is pressing China for an explanation of the incidents described by Google.\n\nU.S. military and government networks \u201ccontinue to be the target of intrusions that appear to have originated from within\u201d China, Navy Admiral Robert Willard, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, said on January 13, one day after Google aired its complaint.\n\nWhile most penetrations are fishing expeditions, Willard told the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee \u201cthe skills being demonstrated would also apply to wartime computer network attacks.\u201d\n\nU.S. national security officials and independent security experts increasingly are voicing alarm about alleged Chinese cyber espionage. For its part, Washington also has a vast espionage corps to steal secrets for its security interests.\n\nChina\u2019s embassy dismissed any suggestion that Beijing was behind cyber attacks against U.S. interests.\n\n\u201cAs China is more than ever integrated with the rest of the world through, and reliant on, the Internet, it has no reason to do anything that will harm or backfire on its own interests,\u201d Wang Baodong, an embassy spokesman, said by email.\n\nLast February, Dennis Blair, the director of national intelligence, said state and non-state foes were targeting U.S. telecommunications networks, Internet and critical industries\u2019 technological underpinning. Cyber attacks were growing more sophisticated and more serious, he said, singling out Russian and Chinese capabilities.\n\nChinese hackers\u2019 tracks have been detected inside some U.S. electricity grids and they \u201cdon\u2019t seem to care about getting caught,\u201d said Joel Brenner, former director of the Office of the National CounterIntelligence Executive.\n\n\u201cDo I worry about those grids, and about air traffic control systems, water supply systems, and so on? You bet I do. Our networks are being mapped,\u201d Brenner told an April 3 forum at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nChina is also preparing for any clash over Taiwan.\n\nJames Mulvenon of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, a consultant to U.S. intelligence agencies, said hackers controlled by Beijing might target U.S. logistics and other support systems in a crisis over the self-ruled island.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese military appears to believe that they can use hacking to exploit our perceived dependencies on cyber systems, and thereby disrupt our deployment to a regional contingency,\u201d Mulvenon said in an email interview.\n\nChina deems Taiwan a rogue province subject to unification with the mainland, if necessary by force. The United States is Taiwan\u2019s main arms supplier and is mandated by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to aid its self-defense.\n\nThe U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission told Congress two months ago that Chinese authorities seem to be recruiting skilled cyber operators from information technology firms and computer science programs into the ranks of \u201cInformation Warfare Militia units.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast last week cited what it called a classified FBI report that estimated China\u2019s army has more than 30,000 cyberspies plus more than 150,000 private-sector computer experts assigned to steal U.S. military and technology secrets. The FBI declined to comment.\n\nIn its China complaint, Google linked to the commission\u2019s report and to a study done for it by Northrop Grumman Corp, the Pentagon\u2019s No. 3 supplier by sales. The study said Beijing appeared to be conducting \u201ca long-term, sophisticated, computer network exploitation campaign\u201d against the government and U.S. defense industries.\n\nOverall, the United States faces \u201can exceptionally serious\u201d challenge, said Linton Wells II, acting chief information officer at the U.S. Defense Department in 2004 and 2005.\n\n\u201cCorporate intellectual property is being stolen in many fields: information technology, bio-technology, defense industrial base, financial, transportation, energy, and others,\u201d said Wells, now at the National Defense University\u2019s Center for Technology and National Security Policy. \u201cCritical components on which our economy, government and national security are based are at risk.\u201d\n\nIn June, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates ordered the creation of the military\u2019s first headquarters to mesh Pentagon efforts in the emerging cyberspace battlefield and computer-network security arenas. The new command will develop offensive cyber weapons as well as defend against them.",

        "body": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday released a patch to protect users of its Internet Explorer browser from attacks similar to those directed at Google Inc\u2019s operations in China last week.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software company, which said hackers targeting Google and at least 20 other companies in China exploited a weakness in its browser, said its new patch was \u201ccritical\u201d and people should apply it as soon as possible.\n\nOther hackers have begun to exploit the flaw, according to researchers with Symantec Corp, the world\u2019s biggest security software maker.\n\nSymantec has found viruses that take advantage of the weakness in Microsoft\u2019s browser on some 100 websites, security researcher John Harrison said on Thursday.\n\nThey are dangerous because they can infect the PC of any user who visits those sites. Unlike less powerful viruses, it is not necessary for people to download software for their machines to become infected, Harrison said.\n\nPCs are safe if they apply the patch, which resolves eight vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Microsoft said. The most serious could allow hackers to gain control of a computer remotely via Web sites people visit while using the browser.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re always working, we have fewer vulnerabilities\n\nthan our competitors,\u201d said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer at an energy conference in Houston, addressing cyber-security concerns.\n\nHe gave no indication that Microsoft would change its business in China after Google threatened to quit the country last week. \u201cWe respect the laws of China, it\u2019s the only appropriate thing for us to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe viruses Symantec has found only successfully attack Internet Explorer 6, though hackers could figure out how to break through the defenses of Internet Explorer 7 and 8, the most recent version of the software, Symantec\u2019s Harrison said.\n\nMost Internet Explorer customers, who have automatic updating enabled on their systems, will not need to take any action on the security patch, Microsoft said. For manual updating, it directed users to its website (here).",
