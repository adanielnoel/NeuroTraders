Internet user numbers are booming in Russia, which has a population of 142 million.",

        "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis (PUBP.PA), said the world\u2019s fourth-largest advertising group hoped to give more details about its cooperation with Web search engine Google (GOOG.O) by the summer.\n\nLevy also told the Reuters Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in Paris on Tuesday that he was \u201crather optimistic\u201d about growth prospects for Publicis this year.\n\n\u201cIt will be a much better year than anticipated by some analysts and much better than last year,\u201d he said.\n\nPublicis, owner of the Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett networks, had seen a \u201cvery good trend\u201d in new business in the first quarter and prospects for the second quarter were \u201cquite good\u201d, he said.\n\nLevy repeated that the second quarter of 2008 would show much better growth than the year-ago period, which he said was \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\nPublicis, which expects 2008 to be boosted by the Beijing Olympics, has not seen any signs yet that its clients were changing their advertising plans amid intense international attention over the human rights situation in China, he said.\n\nIn January, Publicis and Google revealed they were combining their expertise to expand in the fast-growing digital advertising market.\n\nHowever, the pair did not give much detail, only saying that Google would exchange its technological know-how for Publicis\u2019s analytical and media planning expertise.\n\n\u201cWe will develop new areas of cooperation,\u201d Levy said on Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked when Publicis could provide more details on the planned cooperation, Levy said: \u201cWe hope to do that by the summer.\u201d\n\nPublicis and Google disclosed they were cooperating in the digital sector one year after Publicis scooped up Internet ad agency Digitas for $1.3 billion.\n\nThe news also followed a buying spree last year which saw Internet and technology powerhouses such as Google, Yahoo YHOO.O and Microsoft (MSFT.O) snap up several leading Internet ad agencies.\n\nCollaboration with Google also reflects Levy\u2019s view of Internet heavyweights as partners.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see them as enemies but like CBS, TF1 (TFFP.PA) or CNN...,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Publicis announced it planned to cooperate with Google, the head of British rival WPP (WPP.L), Martin Sorrell, said Publicis was revealing a weakness through the deal.\n\nBut earlier this month, Yahoo struck an advertising partnership deal with WPP that will let WPP buy ads on Yahoo\u2019s online ad exchange.\n\nAsked to comment on that deal, Levy said: \u201cHow weak he (must) be to make that agreement!\u201d",
