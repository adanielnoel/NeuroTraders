        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - With its surge on Friday, Google Inc became the latest member, though not likely the last, of a tiny fraternity of companies that boast $1,000 share prices.\n\nIn a market where stock splits have become rarer, there may be more of this to come than just the two stocks with four-digit stock prices in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index - Google and Priceline.com, which hit $1,000 earlier this year.\n\nHistorically, once share prices got too high - even around $125 a share - companies split shares to make them more accessible to Main Street investors. But splits have become few and far between, and big numbers are more the norm for familiar names like Apple Inc, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, Netflix Inc and Visa Inc.\n\nStock splits peaked in 1986 and 1987, when there were 114 and 111 splits, respectively, and they surged again in the go-go days of the dot-com bubble, with 102 splits in 1997, back when retail investors hungrily chased the tech boom, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nThat frenzy ended after the bubble burst, and has diminished further since the last peak in 2007. The trend now, according to Richard Peterson, director of S&P Capital IQ Global Markets Intelligence group, is for companies to let prices rise as retail and individual investors are not as likely to balk as they once were.\n\n\u201cMany retail investors have migrated off to exchange-traded funds or mutual funds. And many of the trading companies don\u2019t want a split because if you split the shares you inherently increase the trading costs,\u201d said Peterson.\n\nPeterson added that if the trend continues, the market could see more companies join Priceline and Google above the $1,000 a share mark.\n\n\u201cMaybe next year or the year after we could see double digits reach the four digit,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1980, just two stocks in the S&P 500 had a price above $125, and 64 companies split their stocks. That figure has slowly dwindled, and in 2013, there were 41 stocks with share prices north of $125 - and just 11 splits, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nMeanwhile, outside of the S&P 500, only a couple have such massive prices: Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s A-class shares, which at $175,748.00 trade just a few hundred shares daily.\n\nThe company\u2019s B shares - first issued in 1996 to attract \u201cinvestors with a long-term perspective,\u201d as Buffett put it then, are the more active. That security was once a $1,000 stock until Warren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate bought railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2009. The B shares edged down 0.04 percent to $116.97 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.\n\nAnother $1,000 name is Seaboard Corp, which at $2,810.98 also only trades a few times daily.\n\nTo be sure, companies are splitting more now than they did during and immediately after the recession when share prices took a tumble. In 2008, nine S&P companies split their stock, followed by 10 in 2009.",

        "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments\u2019 $101 billion Contrafund added to its industry-leading stake in Google Inc in the third quarter, and got a payoff on Friday as the Internet company\u2019s stock soared past $1,000 a share to an all-time high.\n\nContrafund, managed by closely followed stock picker Will Danoff, returned 8.94 percent in the third quarter, easily beating the 5.24 percent gain for the S&P 500 index. But Danoff didn\u2019t get any help from Google in those three months as the shares were flat and lagged the overall market. Google was the biggest factor in holding back the fund\u2019s relative performance in the quarter.\n\nBut in his latest commentary letter released this week, Danoff said Google\u2019s near-flat return opened up an opportunity to add to a stake that was worth $5.8 billion at the end of August. He did not provide specific figures.\n\nAt the end of August, Google made up 6 percent of the fund\u2019s net assets. Among mutual funds, Contrafund is the biggest Google shareholder.\n\n\u201cDespite the underperformance, our long-term view on the stock remained unchanged,\u201d Danoff said in Contrafund\u2019s commentary letter for investors. \u201cBecause we believe the firm possessed superior operating advantages stemming from its dominant market share in Internet search and highly innovative culture, we increased our position in the stock on its weakness.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Danoff\u2019s bolstered bet on Google looked like the right move as the stock jumped 12.5 percent to $1,000.07 in late-morning trading on Nasdaq.\n\nOn Thursday Google reported a big upswing in mobile and video advertising that helped drive a 23 percent gain in quarterly revenue.\n\nMore than a dozen brokerages raised their price targets on the stock to between $880 and $1,220, with Deutsche Bank raising its price target by 26 percent.\n\nSince January 2, Google shares are up 42 percent, rewarding Danoff and other investors.\n\nBut in the third quarter, Danoff\u2019s best bets were on Facebook Inc and Tesla Motors Inc. Facebook\u2019s stock doubled, and got a boost from gains in mobile advertising.\n\nDanoff said Tesla was re-engineering the automobile for the first time in decades. The shares rose more than 80 percent.",

The company is the second in the S&P 500 to trade at this level, following on the heels of Priceline.com, which was trading Friday at $1,052, up nearly 2 percent.\n\nMorgan Stanley shares rose 2.7 percent to $29.72 after the company reported a 50 percent rise in quarterly revenue as higher income from equities sales and trading offset a drop in its fixed-income business.\n\nGeneral Electric Co shares rose 2.7 percent to $25.33 following results, and was the biggest boost to the blue chip Dow index, although declines in Home Depot and Microsoft kept the Dow gains in check.\n\nGE said its third-quarter profit and revenue fell amid a shrinking finance business and negative effects of foreign currency, but Wall Street looked beyond the revenue drop to GE\u2019s improving profit margins and growing order demand.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we just march upwards, and when we get little pullbacks like the one we saw at the open on the Dow, the market bounces right back,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.\n\n\u201cThe focus is off problems in Washington for now, and refocused on earnings, and when a company like Google surprises, it\u2019s a huge plus.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.13 points, or 0.00 percent, at 15,371.78. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was up 6.41 points, or 0.37 percent, at 1,739.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 28.85 points, or 0.75 percent, at 3,891.99.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed to a fresh high Friday, adding to its previous record Thursday, which was spurred by mounting investor confidence in the wake of a last-minute deal by U.S. lawmakers to avoid a debt default.\n\nSo far, 85 companies representing 25.8 percent of S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization have reported, with earnings beating estimates by an average of 4.2 percent, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAlso boosting market sentiment, data showed third-quarter growth in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, grew 7.8 percent from a year ago, its quickest pace for the year, thanks largely to investment.\n\nA number of Federal Reserve officials are due to speak throughout the day, including U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo and New York Fed President William Dudley at a Fed conference on resolution of systematically important banks in Washington.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc shares jumped past $1,000 on Friday as investors bet on the Internet company\u2019s continued dominance of the mobile and video advertising businesses despite aggressive competition from Facebook Inc and Yahoo Inc.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s No. 1 search company rose more than 14 percent to an all-time high of $1,015.46, swelling its market value by about $40 billion.\n\nThat vaulted Google past Microsoft Corp and Berkshire Hathaway Inc in capitalization and brought it to No. 3 among U.S. companies, behind only Apple Inc and Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\nGoogle, whose Android is the world\u2019s most-used mobile software and YouTube is the most popular video-streaming service, on Thursday reported a 23 percent jump in net revenue from its Internet business. Advertising volume soared 26 percent - the highest rate of growth in the past year - and more than made up for an 8 percent slide in ad prices.\n\nBut given concerns about how U.S. companies can increase revenue in an uncertain global economy, those numbers suggested Google was firing on all cylinders except for its perennially money-losing Motorola unit, analysts said.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s ownership of the Android ecosystem makes Google like the house, in Vegas terms,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jordan Rohan. \u201cThe success of Android, which becomes more and more popular every day, is starting to really add up, and Google is collecting small tolls along the way.\u201d\n\nRohan said accelerating revenue growth outside the United States and the UK was impressive, particularly in South Korea and Japan. \u201cThat could go on a while,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least 16 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock to between $880 and $1,220. The shares were up 13.7 percent, or $121.82, at $1010.62 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile,\u201d JPMorgan analysts said. They had expected 21.5 percent growth in ad volumes.\n\nWhile much of Wall Street raised their price targets to above $1,000, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group kept his at $880 and rated Google a hold.\n\nSome analysts warn that spending on ambitious projects with as-yet unproven commercial potential - self-driving cars and wearable Google Glass being among them - may erode margins. Wieser estimated that, excluding traffic acquisition costs, gross margins slipped to 34.9 percent in the third quarter from 37.2 percent in the previous three months.\n\nFacebook and Twitter Inc, which will soon raise $1 billion or more in this year\u2019s most-anticipated initial public offering, may also increasingly grab smaller customers from Google.\n\nAnd then there is Motorola - which only recently began selling the vastly customizable Moto X smartphone in a bid to reverse years of losses and finally generate growth. Sales numbers are not yet available but reviews generally dismiss the device\u2019s chances of displacing, say, the iPhone.\n\nMotorola, acquired by Google in 2012, racked up a loss of $218 million before items in the third quarter, more than four times the $49 million it lost a year earlier.\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge that most investors will look at Google more positively following this quarter, we think that over time issues such as margin erosion, competition and capital intensity will eventually impact the stock,\u201d Wieser said, explaining his below-average price target.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Friday rally stemmed in part from investors\u2019 focus on Facebook and its own increasingly successful efforts to sell advertising on mobile devices. Google stock had gained just 26 percent this year, while Facebook\u2019s has almost doubled.\n\nGoogle and Facebook, which is expected to report its third-quarter results on October 30, also stand head-and-shoulders above the likes of Yahoo. The once-dominant Internet portal this week reported a tepid quarter, losing market share in display and search advertising.\n\nFacebook rose 3.6 percent to $54.08 on Friday, while Yahoo was up 2 percent at $33.40. Baidu Inc, often called China\u2019s Google, gained 7.1 percent to $164.78.\n\nSome say Google still has room for improvement. JPMorgan analysts said continued efforts to counter declines in ad rates might yield a major opportunity in the upcoming holiday season.\n\nGoogle this year rolled out a service to help advertisers promote their products on a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktops. The move is also expected to bolster Google\u2019s overall advertising rates by mitigating the impact of mobile ads, which command lower rates.\n\nOthers say YouTube\u2019s potential remains only partly tapped. Ads on the site increased more than 75 percent in the quarter, with 40 percent of traffic now coming from mobile devices.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Google\u2019s key YouTube asset generated approximately $4 billion in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote.",

It was the best performer on the blue chip Dow index, although declines in Home Depot, down 1.2 percent to $74.82, and UnitedHealth, off 4.6 percent to $68.10, kept the Dow near the unchanged mark.\n\nGE said its third-quarter profit and revenue fell amid a shrinking finance business and negative effects of foreign currency exchange rates, but Wall Street looked beyond those numbers to GE\u2019s improving profit margins and growing order demand.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.37 points or 0.03 percent, to 15,367.28, the S&P 500 gained 6.93 points or 0.4 percent, to 1,740.08, and the Nasdaq Composite added 34.918 points or 0.9 percent, to 3,898.064.\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters data through Friday morning, of the 98 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 62.2 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, just shy of the 63 percent average since 1994 and below the 66 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.\n\nOn a revenue basis, 53.1 percent of the S&P 500 components have beaten expectations, short of the 61 percent rate since 2002 but above the 49 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.",

        "body": "NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with the S&P 500 index heading for its best week in more than three months and earnings from Google, Morgan Stanley and others lifting sentiment.\n\nThe S&P 500, which rose above Thursday\u2019s intraday record of 1732.92 and all-time closing high of 1732.90, was on pace for its third straight day of gains.\n\nIn addition to earnings, the market\u2019s rise was based on expectations that the Federal Reserve will delay trimming its stimulus measures due to the damage inflicted on the economy by the partial U.S. government shutdown that ended on Thursday.\n\nThe market was also relieved that Washington had reached a deal to end the fiscal stalemate.\n\n\u201cTruthfully most of this is the market pricing in the high likelihood that there will be a continuation of monetary policy through the spring,\u201d said Jeff Buetow, chief investment officer at Innealta Capital in Austin, Texas, which manages $3 billion in assets.\n\n\u201cWith the insanity that took place over the past few weeks, I think the Fed is probably going to put some of the long-term decisions on hold,\u201d Buetow said.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.01 points, or 0.17 percent, at 15,397.66. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was up 11.26 points, or 0.65 percent, at 1,744.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 47.49 points, or 1.23 percent, at 3,910.64.\n\nGoogle Inc shares were up 13 percent to $1,007.51 a day after the search engine company posted results that beat forecasts. Google, whose stock hit $1,000 for the first time, led the S&P technology sector, up 1.6 percent, to outperform all other sectors.\n\nHealth was the only declining sector, down 0.6 percent on predictions from UnitedHealth that the new healthcare law\u2019s provision to decrease private Medicare payments could hurt earnings. UnitedHealth shares fell 3.2 percent to $69.08.\n\nMorgan Stanley shares rose 2.5 percent to $29.64 after the company reported a 50 percent rise in quarterly revenue as higher income from equities sales and trading offset a drop in its fixed-income business.\n\nGeneral Electric said its third-quarter profit and revenue fell as its finance business shrunk, but Wall Street looked beyond those numbers to GE\u2019s improving profit margins and growing order demand.

        "body": "Oct 18 (Reuters) - Google Inc shares were set to open at an all-time high near $1,000 after the search engine giant reported a surge in mobile and video advertising that helped drive quarterly revenue up 23 percent.\n\nAt least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock to between $880 and $1,175, with Jefferies bumping up its target price the most at 15 percent.\n\nGoogle said paid clicks increased 26 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year.\n\nThis offset an 8 percent fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads.\n\n\u201cWe view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile,\u201d J.P. Morgan analysts said. They had expected 21.5 percent growth.\n\nIn contrast, analysts say Yahoo, which this week reported a tepid quarter, has lost market share in display and search advertising in the face of strong competition from Facebook Inc and Google.\n\nFacebook is expected to report its third-quarter results on Oct. 30.\n\nTo counter declines in cost-per-click rates, Google rolled out in February a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktops.\n\nThe J.P. Morgan analysts said this drive was a major opportunity for Google in the upcoming holiday season.\n\nAnalysts also highlighted Google\u2019s ability to generate revenue from its video-streaming website, YouTube.\n\nYouTube branded video-ads grew more than 75 percent in the quarter, from a year earlier, with 40 percent of traffic now coming from mobile devices.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Google\u2019s key YouTube asset generated approximately $4 billion in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit in mobile with one billion Android activations.\n\nGoogle, which is also known for its Google Maps service and Chrome browser, reported a 32 percent jump in international revenue during the quarter.\n\n\u201c[Rest Of World revenue] is an encouraging bright spot. Google should be a good play off any European and Emerging Markets recovery,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital markets said.\n\nGoogle shares were trading up 9 percent at $970 before the bell on Friday.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s quarterly results beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations as the Internet search giant expanded its mobile and overseas businesses while keeping ad-rate declines in check, sending its shares to a record high.\n\nThe market reaction put Google\u2019s stock within striking distance of $1,000, following what analysts said was a strong, but not spectacular quarter.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s No.1 Internet search engine jumped 8 percent to $959.65 in after-hours trading on Thursday, after it reported a 23 percent rise in revenue from its Internet business, excluding fees paid to partners, of $10.8 billion in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cExpectations going into earnings were a little muted,\u201d said Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice. \u201cThey did what they needed to do to impress investors.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s business, like rivals Facebook Inc and Yahoo Inc, has come under pressure as more consumers access its online services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, where advertising rates are lower than on PCs.\n\nThe average cost-per-click - the price that marketers pay Google when consumers click on their ads - decreased 8 percent during the third quarter, deepening the 6 percent price erosion that Google experienced in the second quarter.\n\nBut the total amount of paid clicks increased 26 percent year-on-year during the three months ended September 30, the highest rate of growth in one year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key story, their ad volume growth is outpacing the decline in cost-per-clicks,\u201d said JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey.\n\nRoughly 40 percent of the traffic to YouTube, the Google-owned video website, now occurs on mobile devices, Google Chief Executive Larry Page said on Thursday. Two years ago, only 6 percent of YouTube\u2019s traffic occurred on mobile devices.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s done a good job of being in the right place in mobile as it grows, and being able to monetize that,\u201d said Rice.\n\nHe also pointed to Google\u2019s 28 percent revenue growth outside of the U.S. and Britain as further signs of Google\u2019s strength.\n\nGoogle\u2019s results offered a sharp contrast to online rival Yahoo Inc, which reported a slight dip in quarterly revenue on Tuesday and lowered its financial outlook.\n\nOn Thursday, co-founder and CEO Page told analysts he will no longer be joining the company\u2019s quarterly earnings conference calls on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cI know you all would love to have me on, but you\u2019re also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business,\u201d Page said, without providing further explanation for the change.\n\nPage, who with Sergey Brin conceived of what is today the world\u2019s most-used Internet search engine, is not known for assiduously courting Wall Street investors. And this year, Page revealed that his vocal cords are partially paralyzed as the result of a rare medical condition.\n\nNeedham & Co\u2019s Rice said he did not expect Page to be any less involved in running the company, noting that Amazon.com Inc\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos does not participate in the quarterly earnings calls.\n\nGoogle executives also provided few details on the recently-launched MotoX smartphone, the flagship device within Google\u2019s Motorola mobile phone business.\n\nOperating losses at Motorola were $248 million during the third quarter, compared to a loss of $192 million in the third quarter of 2012.\n\nGoogle\u2019s consolidated business earned $2.97 billion, or $8.75 per share in the three months ended September 30, compared to $2.18 billion, or $6.53 per share, last year.\n\nExcluding certain items, Google said it earned $10.74 per share, compared to the $10.34 that analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nConsolidated revenue of $14.89 billion compared with the $14.79 billion average analyst estimate.",
