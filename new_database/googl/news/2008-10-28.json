This revenue sharing agreement could net Yahoo $800 million a year.\n\nThe deal was initially seen as an attempt by Yahoo to fend off Microsoft.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s success must not be allowed to morph into monopoly power. Absent new information about this deal, we believe the Justice Department should protect consumers and stop this transaction from happening,\u201d US PIRG said in the letter.\n\nGoogle and Yahoo are awaiting the result of an assessment of the deal by the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division before implementing it.
