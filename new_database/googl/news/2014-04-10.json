We\u2019ll be allowing anyone in the U.S. to become an Explorer by purchasing Glass.\u201d\n\nMany tech pundits expect wearable devices to go mainstream this year, extending smartphone and tablet capabilities to gadgets worn on the body, from watches to headsets. Google has run campaigns in the past to drum up public involvement, including inviting people to tweet under the hashtag #ifihadglass for a chance to buy a pair of the glasses.\n\nGoogle Glass has raised privacy concerns, prompting some legislators to propose bans on the gadget.",
