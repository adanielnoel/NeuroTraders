        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc slashed its cloud computing service prices on Tuesday, seeking to wrest customers from Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the fast-growing market of renting computers and data storage to companies.\n\nPrice cuts range from 30 to 85 percent. Google\u2019s Cloud Storage will cost 2.6 cents per gigabyte, about 68 percent lower for most customers. Google\u2019s Compute Engine services will cost 32 percent less across all sizes, regions and classes.\n\n\u201cThe cost of virtualized hardware should fall in line with the cost of the underlying real hardware,\u201d Google Senior Vice President Urs Holzle said in a post on Google\u2019s official developers blog on Tuesday in conjunction with a cloud event that the company hosted in San Francisco.\n\nHolzle noted that hardware costs have improved by 20 to 30 percent during the past five years but that \u201cpublic cloud prices fell at just 8 percent per year.\u201d\n\nCloud services are increasingly popular among tech startups and larger companies, which rely on computers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon and Google, the world\u2019s No. 1 Internet search engine, instead of buying the equipment themselves.\n\nAmazon, one of the largest online retailers, was among the first companies to recognize the opportunity. Amazon Web Services provide the underlying infrastructure for key aspects of popular Web companies such as online movie streaming service Netflix Inc and social network Pinterest.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Web Services will hold an event in San Francisco to discuss its business on Wednesday. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it would respond to Google\u2019s price cuts.\n\nEarlier this week Cisco Systems Inc announced plans to spend $1 billion over the next two years to build a new cloud services business.",

        "body": "MILAN (Reuters) - Google has teamed up with Ray-Ban maker Luxottica in a bid to turn its Internet-connected Glass spectacles into a widely-available, stylish consumer product.\n\nIn a statement late on Monday, Luxottica, the world\u2019s biggest eyewear maker, said it had agreed to design, develop and distribute Glass eyewear, which so far has only been available as an expensive prototype in the United States.\n\nGoogle Glass is a small stamp-sized screen attached to a pair of spectacle frames. It can record video, access email, and retrieve information from the Web by connecting wirelessly to a user\u2019s cell phone.\n\nThe deal will allow Italy\u2019s Luxottica to be first to showcase the new technology to millions of potential consumers, although Google has yet to surmount challenges such as battery life and privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cWe believe the challenge of convincing consumers to wear computers on their face is a fashion problem as much as it is a technology problem,\u201d said UBS analyst Fred Speirs of the logic of the tie-up between Google and Luxottica.\n\nThe special glasses can be bought by U.S. residents for $1,500 plus tax, according to Google\u2019s website. To reach a wider consumer market, they would have to be put on sale for a much lower price.\n\nTechnology experts believe wearable computers such as Google Glass could be the next big market for consumer devices, and mirror the way smartphones evolved from PCs.\n\nHowever, some express concern over issues such as intrusion into the privacy of other people who may not be aware they are being filmed or recorded, data security and the safety of wearing Internet-connected glasses while performing other tasks.\n\nLuxottica said its two major brands, Ray-Ban and Oakley, would be part of the deal, but gave no details about the product nor financial aspects of the deal.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a strategic partnership with a leading player like Google is the ideal platform for developing a new way forward in our industry and answering the evolving needs of consumers on a global scale,\u201d Luxottica Chief Executive Officer Andrea Guerra said.\n\nAnalysts said it was too early to incorporate the impact of the deal into revenue estimates.\n\n\u201cThe partnership allows Luxottica to access a technology and a product that could have high upward potential if the product becomes a mass-market one,\u201d said Micaela Ferruta, an analyst with Intermonte.\n\nAt 1600 GMT, Luxottica shares were up 4 percent at 40.55 euros, compared with a 0.6 percent rise in Italy\u2019s benchmark FTSE MIB stock index. Google shares were little changed.\n\nGoogle had previously hoped to launch a consumer version of Glass this year. But Guerra, who said he and Google had been working on a deal for the past 10 months, told Italian daily La Repubblica that the new glasses would be ready to hit the market only in 2015.\n\nIn January, Google struck a deal with VSP, the largest optical insurer in North America, which will provide consumers with subsidized frames and prescription lenses for its Glass.",
