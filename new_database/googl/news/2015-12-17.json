        "body": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New Google (GOOGL.O) leader Sundar Pichai pledged on Wednesday to use India as a testing ground for its products as the U.S. tech giant targets hundreds of millions of consumers in the developing world set to move online in the next few years.\n\n\u201cWe think that what we build in India will apply to many global places,\u201d Indian-born Pichai, appointed chief executive officer in August, told reporters at an event in New Delhi.\n\nWith internet penetration already topping more than 90 percent in many developed markets, Google is increasingly betting on large developing countries like India as a future source of growth. The company does not disclose how much it has invested in India.\n\nGoogle expects more than 500 million Indians to be online by 2018, up from around 300 million today. But Pichai said that with most new users accessing the internet via cheap smartphones instead of desktops, poor mobile connectivity is forcing the company to adapt how it structures and sells its software.\n\nGoogle\u2019s CEO said the company would train two million Indian developers for its Android operating system by 2019, promote internet use among rural women in thousands of villages, and expand its campus in the southern city of Hyderabad to get more people online.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that as the next one billion come online, they have access,\u201d he said during a visit to the Indian capital, where he is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There are likely to be more users of Google\u2019s Android software in India than in the United States next year, Google said in a statement.\n\nPichai cited user-generated maps, as well as a version of YouTube that allows consumers with limited internet access to store videos offline, as two recent examples of products developed in India that have since been rolled out to other countries.\n\nGoogle is also working with Indian Railways to bring wireless internet service to 100 train stations, with Mumbai Central the first to go online in January. It\u2019s also working on increasing the number of local languages available on its virtual keyboard to target non-English speakers.",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Google plans to make its self-driving cars unit, which will offer rides for hire, a stand-alone business under its parent company Alphabet Inc next year, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe service could be launched in San Francisco and Austin, Texas locations, where it has tested the cars extensively, Bloomberg said, citing a person briefed on the company's strategy. (bloom.bg/1RRKfH1)\n\nThe fleets could be deployed first in confined areas like college campuses, military bases or corporate office parks, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe company reorganized itself in August to separate the core web advertising business from newer ventures like driverless cars.\n\nUnder the new structure, search, advertising, maps, YouTube and Android are part of the Google unit. Alphabet\u2019s businesses include connected home products maker Nest, venture capital arm Google Ventures, and Google X, the secretive research arm which houses the self-driving car unit.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s pet project of driverless cars started in 2009 and it along with other automakers have said the technology to build self-driving cars should be ready by 2020.\n\nThe company said in July it was testing a fleet of 23 specially equipped Lexus prototypes, which had logged more than 1 million test miles.\n\nIn June, the company began testing tiny, bubble-shaped self-driving prototype vehicles of its own design on public roads around Mountain View. The company has also started testing self-driving prototypes in Austin.\n\nGoogle\u2019s move to put the self-driving cars up for hire will put it in direct competition with ride hailing services such as Uber and Lyft.\n\nUber also currently uses Google Maps to help users hail a cab as well as chalk out routes. But, Uber awarded TomTom a contract in November to provide digital maps and traffic data for the software used by its drivers.\n\nGoogle-owned online mapping company Waze in July launched a carpooling pilot programme called RideWith in Israel where commuters pay fellow drivers a small fee for a ride.",
