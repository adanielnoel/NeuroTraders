        "body": "SYDNEY, March 1 (Reuters) - ANZ Banking Group has poached Google\u2019s Australia MD Maile Carnegie to the newly created position of digital banking chief, as the country\u2019s No.4 lender pushes into technology amid slowing revenues and stifling competition.\n\nCarnegie, who starts in her new role in July, will lead the bank\u2019s digital push including \u201cstrategic relationships\u201d with the financial technology sector, ANZ said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAustralian banks are beefing up their fintech operations in response to growing competition from smaller digital rivals. According to estimates from KPMG, over a quarter of current banking industry revenue, or about A$27 billion ($19.21 billion), was at risk from \u201cdigital disruptors\u201d.\n\n\u201cMaile\u2019s appointment recognises that digital is central to driving revenue growth and to successfully competing in a changing and disrupted environment where technology and brand are key sources of differentiation,\u201d ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott said in a statement.\n\nMaile would be asked to \u201cshift our thinking\u201d and bring in new technology-literate talent, he added.\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia has set up innovation labs to tap the thinking of tech entrepreneurs, while Westpac Banking Corp has picked equity stakes in several fintech start-ups including peer-to-peer lender SocietyOne.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google said on Monday it bears \u201csome responsibility\u201d after one of its self-driving cars struck a municipal bus in a minor crash earlier this month.\n\nThe crash may be the first case of one of its autonomous cars hitting another vehicle and the fault of the self-driving car. The Mountain View, California-based Internet search leader said it made changes to its software after the crash to avoid future incidents.\n\nIn a Feb. 23 report filed with California regulators, Google said the crash took place in Mountain View on Feb. 14 when a self-driving Lexus RX450h sought to get around some sandbags in a wide lane.\n\nGoogle said in the filing the autonomous vehicle was traveling at less than 2 miles per hour, while the bus was moving at about 15 miles per hour.\n\nThe vehicle and the test driver \u201cbelieved the bus would slow or allow the Google (autonomous vehicle) to continue,\u201d it said.\n\nBut three seconds later, as the Google car in autonomous mode re-entered the center of the lane, it struck the side of the bus, causing damage to the left front fender, front wheel and a driver side sensor. No one was injured in the car or on the bus.\n\nGoogle said in a statement on Monday that \u201cwe clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\u2019t moved, there wouldn\u2019t have been a collision. That said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority will investigate the circumstances of the accident, Stacey Hendler Ross, spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, said on Monday.\n\nShe said the Google car caused minor damage to the bus, striking the \u201cpivoting joint,\u201d or flexible area in the middle of the articulated bus. After the crash, 15 passengers on the bus were transferred to another bus.\n\nAn investigation to determine liability is pending, she said.\n\nJohn M. Simpson, privacy project director for advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, said the crash \u201cis more proof that robot car technology is not ready for auto pilot.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles said on Monday it will speak to Google to gather additional information, but added \u201cthe DMV is not responsible for determining fault.\u201d\n\nGoogle said it has reviewed this incident \u201cand thousands of variations on it in our simulator in detail and made refinements to our software. From now on, our cars will more deeply understand that buses (and other large vehicles) are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles, and we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future.\u201d\n\nThere has been no official determination of fault in the crash. Google has previously said that its autonomous vehicles have never been at fault in any crashes.\n\nThe Mountain View Police Department said no police report was filed in the incident.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration declined to comment.\n\nThe crash comes as Google has been making the case that it should be able to test vehicles without steering wheels and other controls.\n\nIn December, Google criticized California for proposing regulations that would require autonomous cars to have a steering wheel, throttle and brake pedals when operating on public roads. A licensed driver would need to be ready to take over if something went wrong.\n\nGoogle said in November that in six years of its self-driving project, it has been involved in 17 minor accidents during more than two million miles of autonomous and manual driving combined.\n\n\u201cNot once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,\u201d Google said at the time.",
