        "body": "WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Google Inc Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt expressed confidence on Monday that Lenovo Inc would gain approval from U.S. regulators to buy Google\u2019s Motorola smart-phone hardware business in what would be China\u2019s biggest technology acquisition to date.\n\nSchmidt said he saw \u201ca good chance\u201d of the deal passing muster with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which monitors acquisitions by overseas corporations.\n\nSpeaking at a dinner organized by the Cato Institute think tank, Schmidt said Lenovo\u2019s experience buying IBM\u2019s ailing personal computer division in 2005 would stand it in good stead as it seeks the green light to acquire the Motorola business.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance of it being OK,\u201d Schmidt said, adding, \u201cWe would not have done the transaction if we thought it would be in trouble.\u201d\n\nLenovo said last week it would acquire the Motorola handset business, along with some 2,000 patents, for $2.91 billion. That came days after an announcement the company would purchase IBM\u2019s low-end server unit for $2.3 billion.\n\nThe deals will be reviewed by CFIUS to ensure they do not threaten national security.",
