        "body": "(Reuters) - Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) missed Wall Street targets for first-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday as it spent more money to build traffic for its mobile advertising services.\n\nThe results, which were also hit by the strong dollar, drove shares of the Web search company down 6 percent in late trading Thursday.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s consolidated revenue rose to $20.26 billion from $17.26 billion, slightly below the $20.37 billion analyst consensus, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.50, excluding one-time items, missed analysts\u2019 expectations of $7.97.\n\nChief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call with investors that payments to other web sites, known as traffic acquisition costs (TAC), totaled $3.8 billion and accounted for 21 percent of advertising revenues. The percentage of ad revenues spent on TAC grew 13 percent year-over-year.\n\nThat reflects the ongoing shift to mobile advertising and the growing importance of programmatic advertising, in which ads are bought, sold and displayed by automated systems.\n\nInvestors should get used to seeing increased TAC as \u201cthe cost of doing business,\u201d said Sameet Sinha, B. Riley & Co. analyst.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re getting mobile searches from Apple devices you have to pay Apple for traffic so that revenue can happen,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cThe same thing on the programmatic side, when you end up representing more people and selling their ad space or buying their ad space, you have to pay somebody else.\u201d\n\nPorat said spending on traffic acquisition is expected to keep rising as the shift to mobile continues - pressuring the company\u2019s traditionally robust margins on its advertising business.\n\n\u201cI think investors expecting stable margins are probably being overly optimistic. But that said you can have diminishing margins and still have a great business and an incredibly lucrative one,\u201d said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.\n\nGoogle\u2019s advertising revenue increased 16.2 percent to $18.02 billion, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 29 percent, the company said.\n\nLosses increased at the company\u2019s Other Bets business, which includes its broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving cars and X - the research division that works on \u201cmoon shot\u201d ventures.\n\nThe loss widened to $802 million, up from $633 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to $166 million from $80 million.\n\nCompared to Google\u2019s overall business, Wieser said losses in other bets were \u201ctoo small to matter\u201d at the moment.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an optimist you can look to [other bets] and say it can eventually support long term growth.\u201d\n\nPorat said foreign exchange rates factored heavily into the results, shaving $762 million from its revenue for the quarter or $593 million after the effects of a currency hedging program.\n\n\u201cOur total revenue grew 23 percent year-over-year and declined 4 percent sequentially, reflecting holiday seasonality,\u201d she said on the conference call.\n\nMartin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said the effect of foreign currency was worse for Alphabet than expected.\n\n\u201cIf there had been a little better foreign currency translation, it would have been better than the Street consensus,\u201d he said.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s total net income rose to $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, from $3.52 billion, or $5.10 per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell to $732.94 in after hours trade from a close of $780.",
