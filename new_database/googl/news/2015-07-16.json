        "body": "(Reuters) - Google Inc on Wednesday unveiled a new feature called \u201cPurchases on Google,\u201d which allows shopper to buy items directly from mobile search ads.\n\nThe eagerly awaited \u201cbuy\u201d feature, which Google said it was testing with a few retailers, uses saved payment credentials from the user\u2019s Google Account for transactions.\n\nBoth Google and Facebook Inc have been stepping up efforts to advance location-based technology as consumers spend more time on smartphones.\n\nAlong with the ads that pull up in search results, shoppers would also get information on product ratings and availability at nearby stores, the Internet search giant said in a blog post. (bit.ly/1J0yF8A)\n\nThe additional information will be available on Google Chrome for Android this month, with iOS support to follow in the coming months, the company said.\n\nGoogle also said its Google Now service would now offer location-based information, including on discounts on items and the working hours of stores a user is close to.\n\nThe service will also be able to access a user\u2019s browsing history to show if the price of a product a shopper has searched for in the past has fallen.\n\nGoogle also said it would work with online e-commerce companies such as eBay Inc, and direct customers to these companies\u2019 mobile apps instead of their websites.",
