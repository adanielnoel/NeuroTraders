        "body": "(Reuters) - Google is shuttering Google Compare, its U.S. comparison-shopping site for auto insurance, credit cards and mortgages after one year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe quick reversal is a setback to the Alphabet unit's efforts to use its enormous reach to provide consumers with niche shopping services and financial-services tools, the Journal said. (on.wsj.com/1TwbTd9)\n\nThe company said in an email to its partners on Monday that Google Compare\u2019s U.S. and U.K. services would start winding down this month and terminate on March 23, according to the Journal.\n\nGoogle said the service didn\u2019t meet its expectations and that the company will now focus on AdWords and future innovations, the paper reported citing the email.\n\nGoogle could not immediately be reached for comment outside U.S. business hours.",
