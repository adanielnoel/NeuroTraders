        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (Reuters) - Disappointing results from Google Inc and IBM may unnerve investors shaken by a strong recent selloff in tech stocks, underscoring the challenges the Internet and IT sectors face as corporate report cards come due in coming weeks.\n\nThe two companies, both barometers of their respective industries, posted March-quarter results on Wednesday that missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue targets, and their shares fell in after hours trade.\n\nIBM blamed weak hardware sales for its lowest quarterly revenue in five years, worsened by an 11 percent slide in overall sales in emerging markets including China, Brazil, Russia and India.\n\nThat spells trouble for other tech companies reliant on enterprise-spending, such as Oracle, Cisco, EMC and Hewlett-Packard, which report results this month or next. Like IBM, they have struggled to grow their businesses, particularly in China, whose economy is down-shifting after years of hyper-growth.\n\nEnterprise spending in general has been on the wane for traditional computing giants as corporations and even governments increasingly turn to software-as-a-service (SaaS) and other cloud offerings instead of maintaining their own in-house technology infrastructure. Many, including IBM and Oracle, have been left behind by smaller, younger rivals as spending goes toward emerging areas like big data, cloud and cyber security.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of traditional technology vendors struggle,\u201d said FBR analyst Dan Ives.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing spending go away from big-bang projects toward smaller, more modular types of deployments, which speaks to why a lot of SaaS players are doing well. Customers want to buy just the drink rather than the whole bar.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s and IBM\u2019s poor results on Wednesday may do little to change investors\u2019 sentiment following a recent drop in tech stocks. Since early March, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has fallen over 6 percent.\n\nWith the latest results factored in, including IBM and Google, tech earnings growth estimates for the quarter have fallen by roughly two-thirds since the start of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nOn Jan. 1, as the first quarter got under way, analysts on average predicted tech earnings would grow by 7 percent. But now, as first-quarter reports trickle out, analysts on average expect growth of just 2.4 percent, according to the data.\n\nThat also marks a deceleration in tech profit growth from the fourth quarter, when it totaled 10.3 percent, but it is an improvement from 2013\u2019s first quarter, when tech profits shrank by 1.2 percent.\n\nIn Google\u2019s case, investors initially pummeled the stock in after-hours trading after the world\u2019s largest Internet company reported its miss, plus a drop in margins as cost-per-click, or the average price of an online ad, slid 9 percent.\n\nThe shares rebounded after CFO Patrick Pichette attributed that profitability decline to a spike in expenses partly because of its $3.2 billion acquisition of home automation pioneer Nest last quarter, which tacked on a raft of payroll and research costs.\n\nMore broadly, the three largest Internet corporations - Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc - have each grappled with advertising on mobile devices, where the growth is currently concentrated, and where smartphones with smaller displays typically command lower ad prices than on desktop PCs.\n\nFor investors in Google, accustomed to the company enjoying one of the highest ad margins in the business, mobile ads have translated to a steep drop in ad rates. The transition has been less jarring at Facebook, which once relied almost exclusively on low-margin display or banner ads.\n\nTwitter, which had difficulty monetizing its 140-character stream-of-consciousness messaging model, is catching on with TV advertisers because of its growing position as a \u201csecond screen\u201d to accompany TV viewing.\n\n\u201cPeople are trying to adapt to a new delivery system which is mobile,\u201d said B. Riley & Co analyst Sameet Sinha. \u201cIt is a challenge for most companies, and it\u2019s going to be here for the next couple of years.\u201d (Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Ken Wills)",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (Reuters) - Google Inc\u2019s first-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street targets and margins narrowed as the price of its ads continued to decline, underscoring the challenges Internet companies face as the world shifts toward mobile devices.\n\nShares of Google were down 3 percent to $539.80 in after hours trading on Wednesday, after initially sliding roughly 6 percent on the news.\n\nThe number of \u201cpaid clicks\u201d by consumers on Google\u2019s ads increased by 26 percent in the first quarter, disappointing some analysts who had hoped for stronger volume growth. And the average \u201ccost per click\u201d declined 9 percent, extending a downward trend as mobile advertising, typically cheaper than traditional online ads, make up a bigger slice of its business.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest search engine, along with Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, which are due to report financial results in coming weeks, are revamping their products and advertising business to account for smartphones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an average quarter from a great company,\u201d said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. \u201cIt\u2019s the same old story. Paid clicks were a little lighter than people might have hoped, CPC declines were a little higher than people would have liked, expenses continued to rise.\u201d\n\nOperating income slipped to 32 percent of revenue on an adjusted basis, from 34 percent in the year-ago period.\n\nGoogle is spending big to push into various new markets with innovations such as wearable computers, ultra high-speed Internet access and home automation. In January it acquired Nest, which makes smart thermostats and smoke detectors, for $3.2 billion.\n\nThe Nest purchase and some legal expenses bumped up Google\u2019s spending during the quarter, Finance Chief Patrick Pichette said during a conference call on Wednesday. But aside from those items, \u201cour expenses continue to demonstrate the same disciplined agenda we\u2019ve always had,\u201d he said.\n\nSales of digital media such as movies and games in Google\u2019s online Play store, as well as hardware devices such as the Chromecast television gadget, boosted Google\u2019s \u201cother\u201d revenue 48 percent year-on-year to $1.6 billion.\n\nGoogle's revenue climbed 19 percent to $15.42 billion in the first quarter from $12.95 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had estimated $15.54 billion. For a breakdown of other numbers: (link.reuters.com/sux58v) Traffic acquisition costs, the fees that Google pays to partner websites that run its ads, were $3.23 billion, or 23 percent of advertising revenue.\n\nGoogle\u2019s advertising rates, like those of other Internet companies including Yahoo Inc, has been under pressure as more consumers access its online services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, whose advertising rates can be half as much as on personal computers, according to Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice.\n\nGoogle\u2019s ad prices are also under pressure as the company expands into emerging markets, where ad rates are lower, said Rice.\n\nGoogle Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora said prices of mobile ads will eventually catch up to prices of online ads that appear on desktop PCs, as improvements in mobile search capabilities and mobile websites make it easier for consumers to buy things on a smartphone\u2019s small screen.\n\nArora did not provide a time frame, though Needham analyst Rice said he did not expect the change to happen overnight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve probably seen the bottom, but I don\u2019t expect some rapid improvement,\u201d said Rice.\n\nGoogle posted $3.45 billion in net income, or $5.04 per share, in the three months ended March 31, compared to $3.35 billion, or $4.97 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding certain items, Google earned $6.27 per share.\n\nGoogle reported a $198 million net loss from \u201cdiscontinued operations,\u201d which includes the Motorola smartphone business. Google announced plans in January to sell the money-losing business to China\u2019s Lenovo for $2.91 billion. (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Richard Chang)",
