        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) on Monday announced measures aimed at halting the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d on the internet by targeting how some purveyors of phony content make money: advertising.\n\nGoogle said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, while Facebook updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to fake news.\n\nThe shifts comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election.\n\nFacebook\u2019s steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds.\n\n\u201cWe do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\u201d Facebook said in a statement, adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.\n\nGoogle\u2019s move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for \u2018final election count\u2019 for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead.\n\nNor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles.\n\nRather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher\u2019s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\u201d Google said in a statement.\n\nThe company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy.\n\nAdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google\u2019s network, is a major source of money for many publishers.\n\nA report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook.\n\nThat sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google\u2019s AdSense.\n\nFacebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service.\n\n\u201cOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,\u201d he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. \u201cOnly a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\u201d\n\nGoogle has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said.\n\nThe company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google\u2019s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites.\n\nThe issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said.\n\nGoogle has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue.\n\nFil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google\u2019s move with AdSense was a positive step.\n\n\u201cOne of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.\u201d\n\nHowever, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. \u201cWhat if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn\u2019t scale,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Google delivered a vote of confidence in London\u2019s future as a technological hub after the Brexit vote on Tuesday by announcing plans for a new building in the King\u2019s Cross area of the city that will house thousands of extra engineers.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said computer science had a great future in Britain, citing the talent pool, educational institutions, and passion for innovation present in the country.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are investing in London in both engineering talent and infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 10-storey building, Google\u2019s first wholly owned and designed outside the United States, will increase its presence in King\u2019s Cross to more than 1 million square feet, enough for more than 7,000 employees in total, the company said.\n\nGoogle has 5,700 employees and contractors in the UK, including about 2,000 engineers housed in the recently opened building in King\u2019s Cross where Pichai announced the expansion.\n\nPichai, who became CEO in October 2015 when parent company Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) was created, said he was optimistic about Britain\u2019s future, despite the uncertainty caused by June\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.\n\n\u201cHistorically, the UK has been an open and connected economy, and like a lot of businesses we are proud of and rely on the fact that we recruit the best talent from around world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are optimistic that this situation will continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand there is uncertainty and even concerns about topics like Brexit and the pace of technological change in our times, but we know for certain that web and digital technology will be an engine of growth for the UK for years to come.\u201d\n\nBritish Finance Minister Philip Hammond said the investment showed leading firms were still choosing to invest in Britain, while the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said inflows remain \u201crobust\u201d post-Brexit.\n\n\u201cLondon isn\u2019t just the tech capital of Europe, we are on the shoulder of New York and we are catching up with Silicon Valley,\u201d Khan said at the event.\n\n\u201cInvestment into the capital post-Brexit remains robust, so Google\u2019s expansion will further strengthen our city\u2019s reputation as a global leader in digital technology.\u201d\n\nPichai made reference in his speech to another event that exposed a division in a western society: the U.S. election.\n\n\u201cRecent events, including the election in the U.S., have clearly surfaced challenges with inequality and people feeling marginalized,\u201d he said.\n\nThese were \u201clong-term and difficult\u201d problems to solve, he said, but it was his hope that Google would play a constructive role in addressing some of these challenges.\n\nThe company, along with Facebook (FB.O), on Monday announced measures aimed at halting the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d on the internet by targeting how some purveyors of phony content make money: advertising.\n\nThe shifts comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump, who won the Nov. 8 vote.",
