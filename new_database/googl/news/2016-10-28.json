        "body": "(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc bested analysts\u2019 estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday as the search company showed it has honed its core business for the mobile era and is closing in on the next wave of computing.\n\nPropelled by strong advertising on mobile devices and video site YouTube, Alphabet\u2019s net income climbed 27 percent to $5.06 billion. Revenue jumped 20 percent to $22.45 billion, marking the search giant\u2019s seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.\n\nThe company authorized a $7 billion repurchase of its Class C stock, pleasing investors who had been craving more after a $5 billion repurchase last year.\n\nGoogle is competing fiercely with social network Facebook Inc for dominance in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai touted the company\u2019s gains in the space, and was bullish about recent product launches such as the Google Assistant, the Google Home smart speaker and refinements to the enterprise cloud business.\n\nThe products are aimed at the rise of voice search, which many analysts believe will succeed keyboards and touch screens as a primary way users interact with devices.\n\n\u201cWe feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing,\u201d Pichai said in an conference call. \u201cThis new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud.\u201d\n\nShares of Alphabet, the world\u2019s No. 2 company by market value, were up 1.6 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nThe company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $9.06, beating expectations of $8.63 a share on revenues of $22.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.\n\nGoogle has been dogged by concerns about how it would nudge its vast web advertising business toward mobile, but the company\u2019s recent performance has reassured Wall Street that the transition is well underway, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s showing that even though they\u2019ve hit lifetime highs, there\u2019s still room to run,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertising revenue, the company\u2019s lifeblood, rose 18.1 percent to $19.82 billion in the third quarter. Paid clicks, or ads for which advertisers pay only when users click on them, rose 33 percent, compared with a rise of 29 percent in the second quarter.\n\nCost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11 percent in the latest period, but investors are willing to forgive the slump, for now, as it suggests strong mobile growth, said analyst Kerry Rice of Needham & Co.\n\nYouTube continued to post robust gains, Pichai said. Over the past year, Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc have all doubled down on video, a format where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for a few seconds of users\u2019 undivided attention.\n\nAdvertising accounted for 89.1 percent of Google\u2019s total revenue in the quarter, and analysts are eager for the company to tap new sources of growth.\n\nOne of the leading contenders is Google\u2019s cloud business, which drove a 38.8 percent rise in the company\u2019s \u201cother revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment,\u201d Pichai said.\n\nA relatively late entrant to the cloud business, Google is trying to steal market share from industry leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. Amazon on Thursday reported a 55 percent revenue increase in its cloud business.\n\n\u201cI would hesitate to say they are competing head-to-head, but they are making up for lost ground,\u201d Rice said.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s \u201cOther Bets\u201d unit generated revenue of $197 million, primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily units, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the call.\n\nAlphabet said this week it was pausing the rollout of Fiber, a high-speed internet service, in some U.S. cities and that its leader, Craig Barratt, would leave.\n\nPorat played down analysts\u2019 concerns of instability at Other Bets, which has suffered a wave of executive departures, including Nest founder Tony Fadell, self-driving car technology chief Chris Urmson and, most recently, Barratt.\n\n\u201cAs we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it\u2019s inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,\u201d Porat said.\n\nOther Bets, which also includes research unit X, reported an operating loss of $865 million, down from a year-ago loss of $980 million. The narrowing loss suggests Porat is instilling the financial discipline investors have long hoped to see from the company, said Gillis.",
