        "body": "LOS ANGELES, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The Association of National Advertisers sent a letter objecting to the proposed Internet search advertising partnership between Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Google Inc (GOOG.O) to government regulators reviewing the deal, the group said on Sunday.\n\nThe letter to Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnett, noted that \u201ca Google-Yahoo partnership will control 90 percent of search advertising inventory,\u201d the ANA, which represents major U.S. advertisers, said in a statement.\n\nThe partnership \u201cwill likely diminish competition, increase concentration of market power, limit choices currently available and potentially raise prices to advertisers for high quality, affordable search advertising,\u201d the statement said.\n\nBarnett could not be reached for comment on Sunday.\n\nYahoo \u201cremains steadfast in its belief that this deal -- in which prices are determined by advertiser demand-driven auctions, not by collaboration between Yahoo and Google -- will strengthen Yahoo\u2019s competitive position...and will help to drive a more robust, higher quality...marketplace for our advertisers,\u201d the company said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nGoogle spokesman Adam Kovacevich said \u201cnumerous advertisers have recognized that this agreement will help them better match their ads to users\u2019 interests, and that ad prices will continue to be set by competitive auction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile some have raised questions about the agreements\u2019 potential impact on ad prices, advertisers care far more about getting a good return on their advertising dollar than they do about buying cheap ads that don\u2019t bring in customers, and this agreement will clearly help advertisers reach Yahoo users more efficiently,\u201d Kovacevich said.\n\nYahoo struck the agreement in June with Google, the world\u2019s dominant supplier of Web search services, as it sought to shore up its advertising business and ward off pressure to merge from Microsoft.\n\nThe two companies said at the time that they were not required to get regulatory approval before implementing the deal, but had voluntarily delayed it for up to three-and-a-half months while anti-trust regulators review the arrangement.\n\nThe non-exclusive deal covers the United States and Canada but not other markets.\n\nUnder the deal, Google would supply Yahoo with advertising services to run alongside Yahoo\u2019s own Web search system.
