        "body": "BENGALURU/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Google Inc rose nearly 12 percent after the Web search leader\u2019s profit beat forecasts for the first time in the last six quarters, boosted by strong advertising revenue and comments by its new chief financial officer on disciplined spending.\n\nGoogle rallied to $673.50 in extended trading after closing at $601.78 on Nasdaq. That would mark an all-time high for the stock in regular trading if it closes at that level on Friday, adding roughly $40 billion to its market value.\n\nGoogle remains the most valuable publicly traded U.S. company after Apple Inc.\n\nGoogle\u2019s expenses rose 10 percent to $12.9 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from the year-ago quarter, and remained at 73 percent of revenue, the company said on Thursday. But expenses only grew by $91 million from the first quarter, and as a percentage of revenue declined by 1 percentage point.\n\n\u201cThe decline in quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects, in part, discipline in expense management and, in part, lower legal expenses than in comparable periods,\u201d CFO Ruth Porat told analysts on a conference call.\n\nGoogle\u2019s stock rally also appeared to reflect Porat\u2019s comments. The stock was up a little over 7 percent after the close of regular trading and steadily rose during the call as she talked about keeping expenses under control.\n\nAdvertising revenue grew 11 percent to $16.02 billion from the year-ago quarter, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 18 percent, the company said.\n\nAdvertisers pay Google only if a user clicks on one of its ads. \u201cCost per click,\u201d or the average price of online ads, fell 11 percent, but was more than offset by the increase in ad volumes.\n\nGoogle\u2019s ad revenue has been under pressure as consumers access its services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, whose ad rates are typically lower.\n\nThe company's consolidated revenue rose 11 percent to $17.73 billion in the quarter.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In her much-awaited first remarks to investors on Thursday, Google Inc finance chief Ruth Porat stressed keeping expenses under control, which helped send the company\u2019s stock to record highs in after-hours trading.\n\nPorat joined Google in May after serving as Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief financial officer for five years. Analysts and investors hoped she would help rein in costs from non-profitable projects such as those from the Google X lab, which has experimented with Google Glass and the self-driving car.\n\nGoogle\u2019s shares started rising after the company reported higher-than-expected earnings for the first time in six quarters.\n\nAlso boosting the stock were Porat\u2019s comments in a prepared statement that said the company was focused on developing \u201cbig new opportunities\u201d while doing so \u201cwith great care regarding resource allocation.\u201d\n\nBefore the call, shares were up roughly 7 percent. In the course of the call the shares rose roughly 12 percent. Late in the day shares were up a little over 11 percent, at $671, after closing at $601.78 on the Nasdaq.\n\nThat would represent an all-time high for the stock in regular trading if it closes at that level on Friday, adding roughly $40 billion to its market value.\n\nOn the analyst call, Porat continually emphasized operating costs that were growing more slowly and declining expenses that reflected increased discipline in the managing of expenses.\n\n\u201cThe profitability of our business gives us many opportunities, but the main point is today the biggest return on investment has been in our core search business,\u201d Porat said.\n\nAnalysts said Google has made it clear in recent quarters that it would work to tighten spending but that Porat\u2019s comments indicated she would help push the company to control costs further.\n\n\u201cShe will likely look at ways to optimize that, particularly as new products and emerging products grow,\u201d said Kerry Rice, analyst at Needham & Co, adding that Porat would be able to help incrementally improve Google\u2019s cost control measures.\n\nPorat also told investors and analysts, \u201cI am committed to being direct with you.\u201d",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Google Inc won the dismissal of a lawsuit by Android users who said the company violated its own privacy policy by disclosing their names, email addresses and account locations to third parties without permission, to boost advertising revenue.\n\nIn a Wednesday night decision, U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal in San Jose, California, said the users failed to show that Google transmitted their own personal data or that they would suffer economic harm if it occurred.\n\nLast July, Grewal had let the plaintiffs pursue breach of contract and fraud claims, assuming they showed that the data-sharing caused economic harm by depleting their battery power and bandwidth.\n\nBut the judge said the plaintiffs abandoned that argument in their amended complaint filed in February. As a result, he said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue, having \u201cmanaged something somewhat unusual: they pled themselves out of a case.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWith no allegation of dissemination or improper receipt of information, any profit or loss made from any alleged disclosure, let alone a potential disclosure, is conjectural.\u201d\n\nGoogle said $15.51 billion, or 90 percent, of its $17.26 billion of first-quarter revenue came from advertising.\n\nMark Gardy and Joseph Sabella, lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a similar request. The Mountain View, California-based company also operates its namesake Internet search engine.\n\nPlaintiffs Robert DeMars of California, Michael Goldberg of Ohio and Scott McCullough of New Jersey pursued their nationwide class action on behalf of consumers who bought Android apps through the Android Market or Google Play Store between February 2009 and May 2014.\n\nGrewal said it would unfairly prejudice Google to let the plaintiffs amend their lawsuit again.\n\n\u201cYou might think that after three years of complaints, motions to dismiss, orders on motions to dismiss, leave to amend, amended complaints and more, at least the fundamental question of plaintiffs\u2019 Article III standing to pursue this suit would be settled,\u201d he wrote, referring to part of the U.S. Constitution. \u201cYou might think that, but you would be wrong.\u201d\n\nThe case is In re: Google Inc Privacy Policy Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 12-01382.",
