        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Google (GOOGL.O) faces a record antitrust fine of around 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) from the European Commission in the coming weeks, British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph said.\n\nThe European Union has accused Google of promoting its shopping service in Internet searches at the expense of rival services in a case that has dragged on since late 2010.\n\nSeveral people familiar with the matter told Reuters last month they believed that after three failed attempts at a compromise in the past six years Google now had no plans to try to settle the allegations unless the EU watchdog changed its stance.\n\nThe Telegraph cited sources close to the situation as saying officials planned to announce the fine as early as next month, but that the bill had not yet been finalised.\n\nGoogle will also be banned from continuing to manipulate search results to favour itself and harm rivals, the newspaper said.\n\nThe Commission can fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales, which in Google\u2019s case would be a maximum possible sanction of more than 6 billion euros. The biggest antitrust fine to date was a 1.1 billion-euro fine imposed on chip-maker Intel (INTC.O) in 2009.\n\nThe Commission and Google both declined to comment.",
