Burn-in, which usually becomes a problem only after several years of activity, can make it difficult to see information on the display.\n\nGoogle likely would need to halt production if there is problem, said Ryan Reith, a mobile device analyst at research firm IDC.\n\n\u201cWe take all reports of issues very seriously, and our engineers investigate quickly,\u201d Mario Queiroz, Google\u2019s vice president for Pixel product management, said in an emailed statement to Reuters. \u201cWe will provide updates as soon as we have conclusive data.\u201d\n\nThe investigation follows Google\u2019s acknowledgement that it may introduce new software to respond to users\u2019 concern about a blue tint to the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s 6-inch screen. The device incorporates new OLED display technology, which Google described as offering \u201ca more natural and accurate rendition of colors.\u201d\n\nReviewers and users in online support forums have also reported a clicking noise during calls and poor Bluetooth connections between the Pixel 2 and other devices. Google did not immediately comment on the issues.\n\nOn Friday, the company vowed to reimburse an undisclosed number of people who were charged $30 extra for the Pixel 2 by a Verizon Wireless (VZ.N) reseller operating at Google pop-up stores in the United States.\n\nThe surcharge \u201cwas an error,\u201d Google said in its apology.\n\nPrior complaints led Google to drop the price of an adapter used to connect headphones to $9 from $20, matching the price of a comparable iPhone adapter.\n\nGoogle also sent emails over the weekend to buyers advising that delivery of their Pixel 2 may be delayed as much as one month, to late November, according to the AndroidPolice news blog and users\u2019 postings on Reddit forums. Customers said Google offered a free smartphone case, which otherwise starts at $40. Google did not immediately comment.\n\nGoogle made a significant bet on the smartphone business last month, agreeing to acquire an HTC Corp hardware development team for $1.1 billion.\n\nShares of Google fell 1.9 percent to $985.54 at Monday\u2019s close.",
