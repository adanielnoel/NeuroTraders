        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s new smartphone wallet presents a clear challenge to the burgeoning rival service from Apple. The mega-bank is taking on more than just the $680 billion tech behemoth, though. Unveiled with much fanfare by JPMorgan retail banking boss Gordon Smith at a financial technology conference in Las Vegas on Monday, Chase Pay has the potential to shake up the ever more convoluted way payment systems work.\n\nChase Pay, due in mid-2016, proposes to make the process simpler for both customers and retailers. Rather than being just one link in the payments chain, Chase will handle or run pretty much everything. That should mean the all-in cost per transaction falls. It\u2019s even going to pre-load each customer\u2019s most-used credit or debit card into the system. That doesn\u2019t just eliminate an annoyance factor, but also removes what became a security weak spot for Apple Pay: thieves loading stolen cards.\n\nThe payment pipes owned by MasterCard and Visa will keep routing transactions. Even that relationship, however, may be altered. Chase \u2013 aligning itself with the fledgling Merchant Customer Exchange, an early Apple Pay rival led by a group of retailers including Wal-Mart Stores \u2013 is going to charge merchants a flat fee for using Chase Pay, thus getting rid of the variable network and processing fees.\n\nChances are that JPMorgan will cover those, perhaps in anticipation of extra volume bridging the gap between what it collects and what it pays to Visa and MasterCard. The bank run by Jamie Dimon is also absolving store owners of any liability for fraud. And it lets them build their own loyalty and rewards programs into Chase Pay, making life that little bit simpler for buyers while increasing their own ability to increase revenue.\n\nConsumers, meanwhile, will get a way to buy goods and services that works in stores, on mobile phones and on computers, and is potentially devoid of aggravation. All in, that makes the JPMorgan option less an Apple Pay killer than a major threat to rival banks and the likes of card issuers such as American Express. It\u2019s one of the first clear signs that the growing war over financial technology involves battles on many fronts."

Higher-end device sales also grew, a key target for Huawei as it seeks to shed its budget supplier image.\n\nThe July-September numbers puts Huawei on course to move 100 million smartphones this year, 33 percent more than in 2014. That would mean it outpacing growth forecast for major rivals such as Apple, Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL] and Lenovo Group Ltd, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a solid contender to Huawei for the top three position (after Samsung and Apple) in the short term,\u201d said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific director at research firm Canalys. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive growth.\u201d\n\nHuawei remains a distant third, with a smartphone market share worth $7 billion in the second quarter, about one-fifth of those of Apple and Samsung, according to Canalys.\n\nStill, analysts said Huawei\u2019s branding shift to higher-margin premium models, as well as strong relations with telecom carriers at home and abroad, are now helping it cement its position in the global top three. Previously, smaller players often swapped that rank in price wars.\n\nThird-quarter deliveries climbed 81 percent and 98 percent in China and Europe respectively from a year ago. About a third of the quarterly shipments were mid- to high-end models, Huawei said, up from 25 percent a year earlier.\n\nHuawei doubled its China smartphone revenue in the first half of this year, defying a slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest handset market that is enveloping rivals Xiaomi and Samsung.\n\nDespite the strong growth in both Europe and China, analysts said Huawei still needs to win over consumers in the United States - where its market penetration remains low - if it is to become a serious rival to Samsung and Apple as a truly global smartphone brand.\n\nAfter its products were once labeled a national security risk in a U.S. Congressional report, which said Beijing could use Huawei equipment for spying, the firm has this year rolled out new phones and wearable devices in a bid to attract new buyers. The company declined to say how many smartphones it has sold in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see whether they will do well in the U.S. (market),\u201d said Nomura analyst Leping Huang. \u201cIt still has some room to grow.\u201d"

The sequential decline is important as many analysts believe China is poised to replace the United States as Apple\u2019s biggest market.\n\nAnalyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies said as the Chinese market matures, it is beginning to show spikes around the holidays and slumps before the release of a new phone, as in the U.S. market. \u201cThe seasonality in China is really a new wrinkle,\u201d he said.\n\nApple, the world\u2019s largest company by market value, said it sold about 48.05 million iPhones worldwide in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 26, slightly below analysts\u2019 average forecast of 48.72 million, according to a poll by Fortune magazine.\n\nFor the current quarter, which will include a full three months of sales of the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models, Apple forecast revenue between $75.5 billion and $77.5 billion. The company\u2019s generally conservative forecast was in line with Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of $77.17 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\n\u201cThe street was fearing soft guidance and instead got a good December outlook,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.\n\nMorningstar analyst Brian Colello said the forecast was slightly below expectations but investors were pricing in a worse outcome, which was why the stock initially rose after hours.\n\nBoosted by a new pink or \u2018rose gold\u2019 color option, Apple posted record sales of its latest iPhones in the first weekend that they hit stores in late September. The fiscal fourth quarter included only two days of sales of the new iPhones.\n\nThe release of the iPhone 6 set off a sales frenzy last year, propelling Apple to the most profitable quarter ever for a U.S. company.\n\nAnalyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research said Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter suggested the company can top its success last year. \u201cIt suggests that they are definitely up to the task,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI would say I am a little skeptical or wary about how much more market share they can gain in (emerging) markets,\u201d said Tuong Nguyen, a principal analyst at Gartner, citing concerns about whether consumers in those markets can buy costly phones.\n\nApple\u2019s net income rose to $11.12 billion, or $1.96 per share, in the fourth quarter, up from $8.47 billion, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of $1.88 per share and revenue of $51.11 billion.\n\nApple\u2019s shares, which fell steeply in mid-August as concerns about the company\u2019s business in China hit fever pitch, were trading at $114.80 after the bell, after closing at $114.55 in regular Nasdaq trade."

        "body": "LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said on Monday it will soon launch its own competitor to Apple Pay that will allow consumers to pay retailers using their smartphones in stores, and it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants.\n\nThe largest U.S. bank is the latest company to try to profit from the prevalence of smartphones, which many financial executives believe will one day be consumers\u2019 preferred way to pay for everything from milk and eggs at the supermarket to a rental car at an airport.\n\nThe companies that figure out how to convince consumers to stop pulling credit cards out of their wallets and start paying with their phones stand to earn vast sums by taking a percentage of the trillions of dollars that consumers spend annually.\n\nNo clear front-runner has emerged in the business yet. Chase believes its smart phone application, known as Chase Pay, has one key advantage: the caliber of retailers it has brought on board, Gordon Smith, chief executive of the bank\u2019s consumer business, told Reuters.\n\nChase has signed a deal with the Merchant Customer Exchange, a group of major retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, (WMT.N) the largest U.S. retailer, and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) to accept payments through the bank\u2019s technology.\n\nRetailers included in the Merchant Customer Exchange ring up more than $1 trillion of sales per year and have over 100,000 outlets.\n\nRivals like Apply Pay have struggled to sign up retailers to accept their payments. In June, Reuters interviewed the top 100 U.S. retailers and found that two-thirds said they did not plan to accept Apple Pay this year.\n\nApple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) Apple Pay\u2019s website lists Best Buy in its \u201cComing Soon\u201d section but has no mention of Wal-Mart.\n\nChase signed up the Merchant Customer Exchange mainly by promising to cut retailers\u2019 costs, Smith said. Whenever a consumer pays for something with plastic, the retailer pays fees to banks and credit card networks to process the transaction.\n\nChase is willing to accept a lower fee for Chase Pay transactions than for other transactions, and hopes to make up the difference by getting more volume over its network, Smith said.\n\n\u201cAs merchants give us more business, we will give them better pricing,\u201d Smith said in an interview. Chase declined to comment on how much it would cut fees.\n\nChase expects to market its product heavily in the middle of next year. Smith is speaking to retailers about Chase Pay at a conference about payments on Monday in Las Vegas.\n\nDavid Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, which tracks the card business, said JPMorgan\u2019s bid matters to players throughout the industry because of how many cardholder and merchant customers the bank has. \u201cThe whole thing is about scale, and Chase is a titan,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nChase Pay is also promising superior security, a critical selling point after retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) suffered from hacking attacks, Smith said. Longer term, Chase also hopes merchants will offer more discounts through Chase Pay, encouraging consumers to use the technology more.\n\nChase Pay will initially work for consumers that already have Chase credit, debit, and prepaid cards, Smith told Reuters in an interview. There are about 94 million of those cards outstanding now in the United States, and the bank has more spending on them than any other issuer. The app will work on Apple and Android-based phones.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer bank has already factored the system\u2019s near-term launch costs into its expense estimates, and expects the benefits to come over the medium to long term.\n\nThe bank will continue working with Apple Pay and other services even as it builds a rival, Smith said.\n\nChase Pay is just one of a series of companies trying to become the go-to payment technologies, including Apple Pay, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u2019s (005930.KS) Samsung Pay, and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Android Pay."

        "body": "* Q3 shipments up 81 pct in China, near double in Europe\n\n* United States the next key market for Huawei - analysts\n\nHONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co is set to be the fastest-growing major smartphone vendor this year, analysts said, boosting its drive upmarket to challenge industry giants Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc.\n\nThe upbeat view came after Huawei, the world\u2019s third-biggest smartphone supplier by volume, on Tuesday said third-quarter global smartphone shipments jumped 63 pct year-on-year to 27.4 million handsets. Higher-end device sales also grew, a key target for Huawei as it seeks to shed its budget supplier image.\n\nThe July-September numbers puts Huawei on course to move 100 million smartphones this year, 33 percent more than in 2014. That would mean it outpacing growth forecast for major rivals such as Apple, Xiaomi Inc and Lenovo Group Ltd , analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a solid contender to Huawei for the top three position (after Samsung and Apple) in the short term,\u201d said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific director at research firm Canalys. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive growth.\u201d\n\nHuawei remains a distant third, with a smartphone market share worth $7 billion in the second quarter, about one-fifth of those of Apple and Samsung, according to Canalys.\n\nStill, analysts said Huawei\u2019s branding shift to higher-margin premium models, as well as strong relations with telecom carriers at home and abroad, are now helping it cement its position in the global top three. Previously, smaller players often swapped that rank in price wars.\n\nThird-quarter deliveries climbed 81 percent and 98 percent in China and Europe respectively from a year ago. About a third of the quarterly shipments were mid- to high-end models, Huawei said, up from 25 percent a year earlier.\n\nHuawei doubled its China smartphone revenue in the first half of this year, defying a slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest handset market that is enveloping rivals Xiaomi and Samsung.\n\nDespite the strong growth in both Europe and China, analysts said Huawei still needs to win over consumers in the United States - where its market penetration remains low - if it is to become a serious rival to Samsung and Apple as a truly global smartphone brand.\n\nAfter its products were once labeled a national security risk in a U.S. Congressional report, which said Beijing could use Huawei equipment for spying, the firm has this year rolled out new phones and wearable devices in a bid to attract new buyers. The company declined to say how many smartphones it has sold in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see whether they will do well in the U.S. (market),\u201d said Nomura analyst Leping Huang. \u201cIt still has some room to grow.\u201d (Reporting by Yimou Lee; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)"

The world\u2019s largest chemicals firm blamed struggling emerging markets like China and Brazil\n\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei tumbled overnight too, after the yen gained. Chinese markets dove 2 percent, then recovered, in another volatile session after last week\u2019s surprise PBOC rate cut.\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.1050 after the European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist said there were \u201cno taboos\u201d as it seeks ways to push up inflation.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation where the time-frame for achieving the inflation objective risks once again to be moved back,\u201d the ECB\u2019s Peter Praet said. \u201cThe Governing Council has given a very strong message: it is ready to draw the consequences of its assessment of the monetary policy stance.\u201d\n\nThe most pressing topic for traders remained the Fed meeting that ends on Wednesday. Markets are pricing in only around a 7 percent chance the U.S. central bank will raise rates this week, but they will be watching for signals that it might act at its next meeting, in December. FED/DIARY\n\nAfter rising 3 percent over the last two weeks despite diminishing expectations that rates would rise in 2015, the dollar tracked world shares lower to fall for a second day against the other main global currencies.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar was off 0.1 percent at 96.719 and yields on U.S. government bond Treasuries drifted lower.\n\nHSBC currency strategist Dominic Bunning said markets were in a holding pattern before the Fed and Friday\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting, which may bring more stimulus, and that the current risk-off mood would unlikely to last.\n\n\u201cClassic risk assets are all slightly softer, but it\u2019s not been an aggressive move,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the positioning is there to see these massive spikes in emerging market selling and related safe-haven strength.\u201d\n\nThe euro fell 0.6 percent to 133.03 yen, its weakest since early September. The dollar also fell 0.6 percent to 120.34 yen, down from 121.60 on Friday.\n\nApple will announce results later, with investors anxious to hear how many new phones it has been selling and its assessment of the world economy. Twitter reports after markets close as well.\n\nAlibaba shares rose nearly 10 percent to $83.50 in pre-open trading after the China-focused e-commerce giant reported better-than-expected revenue.\n\nBut BASF, whose products range from car coatings to mining acids, blamed the pressures facing major emerging markets like China and Brazil for the profit warning that knocked its shares 3 percent lower.\n\n\u201cWe experienced a pronounced summer lull and no volume momentum in September. Major markets like Brazil are in a recession, or face lower growth rates, such as China,\u201d Chief Executive Kurt Bock said.\n\nMSCI\u2019s main emerging markets stock index was on course for its fifth decline in six days.\n\nIn Russia, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov compounded big falls in the rouble when he said he saw risks the country\u2019s Reserve Fund would be exhausted by the end of next year if oil prices stay at their current level.\n\nOil prices extended losses into a third week. U.S. crude was down 1 percent at $43.45 a barrel and Brent fell as low $47.17 a barrel before a minor rebound in early European trading.\n\nThree-month copper was up a touch at $5,226 a tonne, while safe-haven gold climbed to $1,165 an ounce to end three days of falls.\n\n\u201cUnless the Fed says it is going to reverse course, that it\u2019s not going to tighten but to loosen because the U.S. economy is so weak - which nobody expects - gold shouldn\u2019t move above $1,200 on a sustainable basis,\u201d Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said."
