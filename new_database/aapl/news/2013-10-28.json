        "body": "Oct 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone sales and revenue forecasts, due to be released on Monday, may offer clues as to whether its low-cost 5C model missed the mark or whether the world\u2019s largest tech company can continue its run of smash-hit gadgets.\n\nSigns have emerged that demand for the cheaper model is lagging the top-tier iPhone 5S - both of which went on sale in September - because its $100 discount is proving to be insufficient to motivate emerging market and price-conscious customers.\n\nBut some analysts say the concerns are overblown and that a greater proportion of iPhone 5S shipped, translates into better margins and earnings overall.\n\nApple will be reporting results just a week after taking the wraps off an incrementally improved iPad Air. But it is the iPhone, which accounts for more than half the company\u2019s profit and is its highest-margin gadget, that takes center stage.\n\nApple is expected to report sales of 33 million to 36 million iPhones in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September, rising to more than 50 million in the typically strong holiday quarter - the first full quarter of sales of the two new phones.\n\n\u201cMedia reports of 5C production cuts are misleading, in our view, given what we think has been strengthening overall 5S/5C production with 5S vectors continuing to strengthen even real time,\u201d Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen & Co, said in a research note.\n\nApple has come under pressure over the past year or two to bolster sales of its iPhones and iPads as perennial rival Samsung Electronics and cheaper gadgets based on Google Inc\u2019s Android software chip away at its once-leading market share.\n\nIts stock has gained 12.5 percent since August, when famously aggressive activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed a large position in the iPhone maker and began making calls for a new, stepped-up $150 billion share buyback program - boosting hopes of a bigger return of cash to shareholders than anticipated. [ID: nL1N0IE0Y5]\n\nBut the stock is still down about 1 percent this year, vastly underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 23 percent gain.\n\nLonger-term, investors wonder whether the company that revolutionized the cellphone industry and popularized the tablet computer has another groundbreaking device left in it.\n\nAnalysts say it will take a genuinely new device - like the oft-rumored smartwatch or some sort of TV - to revive the stock. Investors also hope that Apple will seal a deal to sell phones through China Mobile Ltd, gaining access finally to the country\u2019s largest telecoms operator.\n\n\u201cWe do see fewer positive catalysts for the stock as the company finishes its annual product line refresh,\u201d Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial, said in a Friday note to clients.\n\nApple is expected to have moved 15 million iPads in the September quarter, which would be an increase of 1 million over the year-ago quarter.\n\nA month ago, on the back of strong initial sales of its new iPhones, Apple polished its fiscal fourth-quarter financial forecast, saying it expected revenue toward the high end of its previous forecast for $34 billion to $37 billion.\n\nInvestors will also look at Apple\u2019s December quarter forecasts - once ludicrously conservative but now a better indication of management\u2019s expectations - for an idea of the company\u2019s holiday-quarter hopes.\n\nApple is cutting production orders for the plastic-backed, multi-hued model just a month after launch, a source familiar with its supply chain said a week ago, fueling speculation its discount to the 5S may not be enough to drive demand during the crucial shopping season.\n\nPegatron Corp, which assembles the model, had seen orders reduced by less than 20 percent, said the source, who asked not to be identified because the information is sensitive. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, another major assembly contractor for the 5C, had its orders for the same period reduced by a third, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBeyond holiday projections, analysts want evidence on Monday that profit margins can be sustained as the competition intensifies, and evidence of its ability to innovate.\n\nWall Street is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $36.8 billion, up from $36 billion a year ago, and earnings per share of $7.93, down from $8.67 a year ago, as profit margins come under pressure."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s quarterly revenue barely beat Wall Street\u2019s heightened expectations after it sold a solid 33.8 million iPhones in the September quarter, but gross margins and profit slid, disappointing some investors.\n\nShares in the company were down more than 2 percent after hours.\n\n\u201dThey guided for a solid quarter and it came in a little bit above where they guided. The upside looks like more aggressive share-repurchase and better iPhone numbers than people were expecting.\n\n\u201dThey\u2019re guiding for another solid quarter and indicating that they\u2019re going to continue along their path of aggressively returning cash, although not as aggressively as (Carl) Icahn might like.\n\n\u201dClearly the iPhone is doing very well at 33 million sold. There was a point in time when people were talking about this quarter as potentially really low for iPhone units, but now the basic consensus on the street is the iPhone is still doing well.\n\n\u201dTheir operating expense is up a bit more than I anticipated. They\u2019re going to be very aggressive in terms of their marketing.\n\n\u201cThey had already preannounced and people got euphoric in recent weeks. It wasn\u2019t a massive blowout. They\u2019re taking a much more pragmatic, rational guidance these days.\u201d\n\nOn why Apple\u2019s stock fell following the report: \u201cIrrational expectations on part of over-exuberant analysts trying to have the high number.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe Mac revenue was on the light side and it was negatively impacted by a sharp decline in the blended ASPs.\n\n\u201cMy view is they were going to take an iPad hit in front of the new cycle. That was to be expected. I don\u2019t think they terribly \u2018upsided\u2019 the gross margin as much as some people would have wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201dWith Apple focusing on premium products, maintaining their pricing, ignoring calls for a low-cost iPhone in China, I think we would have expected higher gross margins.\n\n\u201cWith the higher-price phones and clear preference toward the 5S, we were all expecting more of a gross margin boost for the December quarter.\u201d"

Fast forward to about 3:35 to see the campus, as well as the architects and Apple planning personnel:\n\n\u201cOne of the most memorable things \u2014 and perhaps vital to the project \u2014 was Steve [Jobs] saying: \u2018Don\u2019t think of me as your client. Think of me as one of your team,\u2019\u201d says Norman Foster, the chief architect.\n\nThe campus will house 24,000 Apple employees in an environmentally friendly building that Apple is designing to have no net new environmental impacts.

I wonder how many other tech companies have a senior arborist. \u201cOur plan is to transplant the most resilient trees on the campus, and augment them with even more resilient species, such as oaks.\u201d\n\nOn November 15, Cupertino\u2019s city council will vote on final approval for the project. There is almost no opposition to the project, so this would seem to be almost a formality, and construction could start this year.\n\nThe last word, as it should be, is from Steve Jobs:\n\n\u201cI think we do have a shot at building the best office building in the world.\u201d"

Fed policymakers will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have tapering probably until March or June. Energy prices are going down, which will help the consumer discretionaries. All of that kind of bodes well for maybe a better holiday season,\u201d said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.\n\nShares of Apple Inc, whose highly-anticipated results will come after the market closes, were up 0.9 percent at $530.70.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.75 points, or 0.17 percent, at 15,596.03. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was up 5.03 points, or 0.29 percent, at 1,764.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 2.57 points, or 0.07 percent, at 3,945.93.\n\nOn the down side, Dow component Merck & Co fell 2.8 percent to $45.25, one of the biggest drags on the Dow, after reporting a decline in sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment, raising concerns about growth prospects for its biggest product.\n\nBiogen Idec posted a rise in its third-quarter profit and boosted its full-year earnings and revenue outlook, sending its shares up 2.5 percent to $258.61.\n\nBased on Thomson Reuters data through Monday morning, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen just 3.4 percent in the third quarter.\n\nOf the 249 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, 69.1 percent beat analysts\u2019 expectations, above both the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 66 percent rate for the past four quarters.\n\nRevenue has been lackluster, however, with growth seen at 2.2 percent for the quarter.

        "body": "* S&P 500 hit record close Friday after three weeks of gains\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Monday, indicating that the rally that took major indexes to record highs would continue with the latest earnings, including Apple\u2019s much-anticipated results.\n\nThe largest U.S. company by market cap, Apple Inc will report after the market closes. Investors want to see the amount of sales of the company\u2019s low-cost iPhone.\n\nThe S&P 500 has hit a series of record highs over the past two weeks, including Friday. However, further gains may be harder to come by given the market\u2019s rapid advance this year.\n\nThe gains have largely come from expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not slow its stimulus policies for several months. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee will meet Tuesday and Wednesday and, according to analysts, is extremely unlikely to alter its policies.\n\n\u201cIn the short-term we\u2019re overbought and due for a pullback, but with the Fed continuing stimulus investors are looking for a reason to sell and they can\u2019t find one,\u201d said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.\n\nCorporate earnings have also given investors reason to buy. While the third-quarter results have been mixed and revenues in many cases below expectations, bellwethers like Microsoft and Amazon.com rallied last week.\n\nNoting that Apple shares are down slightly this year, Sarhan said that \u201dfrom a valuation standpoint, Apple is something of an underdog.\n\n\u201cThe stock is trying to move back up after consolidating, and since it is such a large percentage of the Nasdaq, what\u2019s good for Apple is good for the market at large.\u201d\n\nS&P 500 futures rose 2.1 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 45 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 7.25 points.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 23.4 percent so far this year, just shy of the 23.5 percent gain it posted in 2009. Surpassing the 2009 record would give the index its biggest annual gain in a decade.\n\nMuch of those gains have come recently, with both the Dow and S&P 500 posting their third straight week of gains last week. The Nasdaq has climbed for seven of the past eight weeks while the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks registered its eighth week of gains last week, its longest streak since 2003.\n\nMerck & Co reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, though sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment fell, raising concerns about growth prospects for its biggest product. Shares of the Dow component fell 1.3 percent to $45.95 in premarket trading.\n\nBased on the latest Thomson Reuters data, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen just 3.4 percent in the third quarter, with 69 percent of companies reporting earnings above analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue growth is seen at 2.2 percent for the quarter, with just 54.2 percent beating sales estimates, below the long-term average of 61 percent.\n\nInvestors will also look ahead to September pending home sales, due at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), which are seen rising 0.1 percent, a rebound from the 1.6 percent decline last month.\n\nIn company news, cable television network AMC Networks Inc on Monday said it agreed to buy Chellomedia, the international content unit of Liberty Global Inc, for about $1.04 billion."
