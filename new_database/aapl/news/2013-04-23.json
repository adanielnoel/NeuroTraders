        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc scored a win on Monday when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that it did not violate a Google patent to make the popular iPhones.\n\nApple had initially been accused of infringing on six patents for iPhone-related technology covering everything from reducing signal noise to programming the device\u2019s touch screen so a user\u2019s head does not accidentally activate it while talking on the phone.\n\nIf Apple had been found guilty of violating the patent, its devices could have been banned from being imported into the United States.\n\nGoogle can appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed with this outcome and are evaluating our options,\u201d the company said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Apple declined comment.\n\nThe smartphone industry has seen dozens of lawsuits on several continents as Apple vies for market share with companies that make smartphones that use Google\u2019s Android software.\n\nGoogle acquired the patents in the case - and the lawsuit - when it purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2012, partly for its library of telecommunications patents.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Android software, which the company lets handset makers use for free, has become the world\u2019s No. 1 smartphone operating system, ahead of the iOS software used on Apple iPhones.\n\nThe ITC, a U.S. trade panel that investigates patent infringement involving imported goods, is a popular venue for patent lawsuits because it can bar the importation of infringing products and because it issues decisions relatively quickly.\n\nMotorola Mobility, which has since been acquired by Google, accused Apple in 2010 of infringing on six of its patents. Two were terminated from the case, and the ITC said last August that Apple was innocent of infringing three others.\n\nBut the commission had also asked its internal judge, Thomas Pender, to reconsider its finding that Apple did not violate a fourth patent, which is for a sensor to monitor the location of a user\u2019s head to keep it from maneuvering on the touch screen. Pender found that patent obvious in December, and the full ITC came to the same conclusion on Monday.\n\nThe case in the ITC is In the Matter of Certain Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing Devices, Computers and Components Thereof, 337-745."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, bowing to Wall Street\u2019s increasingly strident demands, announced a doubling in its cash-return program for shareholders as it reported better-than-expected quarterly results.\n\n\u201dWe all had concerns on the June quarter guidance. The issue was 15 out of 40 analysts had cut June quarter numbers. The market was telling you the numbers were too high. Now the stock is up on guidance that\u2019s pretty much even worse than even I was expecting.\n\n\u201dBut the actual March quarter was fantastic. So you got to take the actual results first. And that buyback, that\u2019s a big chunk of dough to be throwing at the market. That\u2019s going to help.\n\n\u201dBuying back stock like that with the bulk of the cash, they\u2019re saying they\u2019re big believers in what\u2019s happening inside the company. And for those who want yield, they\u2019re giving a little bit of taste with the dividend. I respect that. I would have wanted a little bit more on the divvy.\n\n\u201cThe market was expecting a weak June quarter. We\u2019re not likely to have any new product shipping in June. Doesn\u2019t mean that the market isn\u2019t changing structurally for Apple. ASPs are declining and margins are going to be under pressure. These things look like the realities. So I don\u2019t expect the stock to soar back to where it was. But it\u2019s nice to see it not crumble apart.\u201d\n\n\u201dEncouraging to see them talking about the dividend. What they did do is, they\u2019re expanding their repurchase program. Last year it was $10 billion and now they bringing it up to $60 billion. That means they believe in the company. That\u2019s exactly what we need.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m actually relieved to see the numbers. I think it\u2019s a transitional quarter. The new products are all coming out next quarter and China still hasn\u2019t kicked in. So, given the fact that the whisper was for them to not even hit the lower number, given the fact that they hit the midpoint numbers, this slight beat is actually very positive.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe March results were in line with our expectations. The bigger news, and what is driving the stock up 5 percent, is the big buyback announcement and Apple putting its big cash balance to use.\n\n\u201dWe are encouraged that they expect to borrow to fund it in order to get that overseas cash, which is trapped. Most of Apple\u2019s cash is overseas, so what they have to do is take debt in the U.S. that is probably collaterized with the money overseas.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping Apple would make such a move and I think investors are encouraged by it.\u201d\n\n\u201dFrom a unit-volume perspective, in the different markets I think they\u2019ve done well. On the iPhone 5, China has had a big role to play within the quarter, and it looks like Apple was able to take advantage of the Chinese New Year, and the pickup of the iPhone 5 introduction in China.\n\n\u201dThe overall iPad number was positive. Only a marginal decline over Q4, their strong seasonal quarter. It will be interesting to see the mix of that 19 million, how much of that is iPad mini vs traditional, and to see if they\u2019re keeping the mix at 50-50 as it was in Q4, or if the iPad mini is beginning to erode into the traditional iPad.\n\n\u201cOn the Mac, obviously 4 million is not the number that people are going to pay attention to. But a nearly flat number from year before in Q1, when the market was down double digits, that\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe results were as expected. They slightly beat the lowered expectations, and they guided low. That was all expected. This was in preparation of a new product cycle that will come in the August to October timeframe.\n\n\u201dThey did increase the share buyback, that\u2019s a band aid. The investor focus should be on, when are the new products coming? As soon as Apple launches new products, that\u2019s the key to the stock recovering.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, the stock could go to all-time highs. But unless Apple comes out with new products, the stock will be going sideways.\u201d"
