        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) remains undervalued and misunderstood, activist investor Carl Icahn tweeted, even as the company posted stellar quarterly results on Monday.\n\nThe billionaire investor said he expects to put out an \u201cin-depth\u201d report within two weeks.\n\nApple beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue and profit forecasts on Monday as it sold more iPhones in China than the United States for the first time.\n\nThe most valuable publicly traded U.S. company also raised its quarterly dividend by 11 percent to 52 cents per share and boosted its share buyback program to $140 billion from $90 billion.\n\nIcahn, who has been vocal about his belief that Apple is undervalued, has urged the company\u2019s board to buy back more shares using its huge cash pile. He has also pledged to keep his own stock out of any repurchase.\n\nThe 79-year-old, one of Apple\u2019s top 10 investors, said in February that Apple stock should be trading at $216.\n\nApple\u2019s shares were marginally down at $132.62 by midday. The stock had fallen as much as 2.3 percent earlier in the day."

        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nApple can\u2019t pay out its readies fast enough. The $760 billion iPhone-making money machine is adding $50 billion more to its buyback plans. Throw in an increased dividend, and the total set to go back to shareholders between 2012 and 2017 is an eye-watering $200 billion.\n\nNumbers for the quarter to March, though, show Greater China overtaking Europe as Apple\u2019s second-biggest market after 71 percent growth in the region. Chief Executive Tim Cook is in danger of taking more fire for returning cash too slowly.\n\nWhile much attention is centered on the outlook for the new Watch, Apple\u2019s fortunes are still tied largely to the iPhone. The astonishingly successful gadget now accounts for about 70 percent of sales \u2013 and more of profit. The company sold 40 percent more units than it did in the same quarter last year, which underpinned 27 percent overall top-line growth at Apple. While the device is gaining share from rivals in markets worldwide, it is doing particularly well in Asia and emerging markets, shrugging off a strong dollar.\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s high profitability boosted Apple\u2019s operating margin 1.5 percentage points to 31.5 percent in the quarter. The result was a remarkable flow of cash into the company\u2019s coffers. Its cash and investments totaled $194 billion at March 28 \u2013 if held in $100 bills, that would weigh about 2,000 tonnes \u2013 against only $40 billion of long-term debt.\n\nHence the increased buyback plan and dividend. Investors may be pleased enough, but soon they could be grumbling for more. After all, the additional announced buyback barely absorbs the last two quarters of Apple\u2019s free cash flow.\n\nCook sounded optimistic about the Middle Kingdom, and the iPhone\u2019s appeal to the emerging middle class there. Not to mention what the company claims are near 100 percent customer satisfaction rates for its phone. If everything is really going that well in the PRC, though, Apple\u2019s payouts will fall short of catching up \u2013 and shareholders will pester Cook for even more cash."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple\u2019s large-screen iPhones are a big hit in China, taking market share from Samsung and selling at a pace that may make China a greater source of revenue than the Americas for Apple in coming years, analysts said.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable consumer electronics company reported on Monday a 71 percent increase in sales in China to $16.8 billion, driven by its new, bigger iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. In the first three months of the year, for the first time, Apple sold more iPhones in China than in the United States.\n\nConsumer demand for the newest electronics pushed sales in China to 29 percent of total global sales for Apple in the first quarter, compared with 21 percent a year ago. By comparison, the Americas represent 37 percent of total sales, but are growing more slowly at only 19 percent last quarter.\n\n\u201cThe bigger screens on iPhone 6 have been selling like hot cakes,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in New York, who estimated that China could represent as much as 40 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue by 2017. For Apple, China is \u201cthe golden goose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe surge in sales, helped by Chinese New Year gift-buying, was caused by a latent build-up in demand, analysts said.\n\n\u201cApple fans in China had been waiting years for bigger-screen iPhones and they are upgrading at a furious rate to the new models,\u201d said Neil Mawston, executive director at research firm Strategy Analytics.\n\nSamsung won over millions of Chinese mobile customers four years ago with its Galaxy Note \u2018phablet\u2019, creating a whole new category somewhere between a phone and a tablet, with screen sizes of more than five inches diagonally, compared to the previous standard of about four inches.\n\nApple is starting to win some of them back again.\n\n\u201cApple really had no choice but to come back with a bigger screen iPhone for the 5-inch category to bring those switchers back, and that\u2019s precisely what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Mawston.\n\nChinese customers gravitated naturally to the bigger screen size, as it makes it easier to input Chinese characters with a finger or stylus on the screen and is more effective for video.\n\nFor many Chinese, the phone is also the first, the most important, or even the only computing device they own.\n\n\u201cPeople just use them for more, and therefore appreciate the bigger screen,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst at technology research firm Forrester. Chinese customers tend to do their computing on-the-go or at various locations, partly due to patchy broadband availability at home, and is truly a \u2018mobile-first\u2019 tech culture, said Gillett, which puts extra value on the phone.\n\nApple\u2019s distribution and marketing in China has now also clicked into place, analysts said. In October, for the first time, Apple offered phones with all three major carriers, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom, with attractive subsidies.\n\nThat presence may bode well as Apple looks to win new customers and entice others away from Samsung and local competitor Huawei.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t drop their brand new phones and run out and get new ones immediately,\u201d said Gillett. \u201cIt takes a while to build up steam as people hit the replacement cycle.\u201d\n\nApple is also making inroads outside of the biggest cities. Its phones are now sold in more than 40,000 places in China, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a call with analysts on Monday.\n\nAnalysts say Apple makes higher profit margins on the iPhone 6 Plus. Apple doesn\u2019t say what its sales or its margins are for individual phone models.\n\nThe bigger phone, with a 5.5 inch diagonal screen compared to 4.7 inches for the regular iPhone 6, sells better in China than in any other region, said Mawston, although it still lags sales of the smaller, cheaper iPhone 6.\n\n\u201cThe 6 Plus has its lowest volumes in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, and its highest in East Asia, while everything else is in between,\u201d he said.\n\nAs far as many Chinese are concerned, the bigger the phone the better.\n\n\u201cSome consumers aspire to own the \u2018full set\u2019 of a big house, big car, big TV and big smart phone,\u201d said Mawston at Strategy Analytics."

The iPhone 6 was launched last autumn in China with a number of carriers.\n\nWall Street hailed the results but share reaction was muted. Its shares rose 1.6 percent in after-hours trading to $134.52.\n\nApple sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, up 40 percent from the year-ago quarter, but down from the record-breaking holiday quarter. It sold 12.6 million iPads, down 23 percent from a year ago.\n\nApple\u2019s big screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been popular with customers worldwide, helping the company overtake rival Samsung in global smartphone sales last quarter.\n\n\u201cA 60 million-plus iPhone number is a home run and will be cheered by the Street as this remains the bread and butter of Apple,\u201d said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nApple gave no sales figures for its recently released Apple Watch, but did say the current quarter was off to \u201can exciting start\u201d.\n\nCook said demand for the watch continued to be greater than supply, as it has been since pre-orders started earlier this month.\n\n\u201cFrom a demand point of view, it\u2019s hard to gauge when you don\u2019t have product in stores,\u201d said Cook on a conference call with analysts. Apple is only selling the watch online and in select third-party boutiques due to the large number of models and straps for the watch, which could become a logistics nightmare if it offered every permutation of the many varieties at already jam-packed Apple stores.\n\nThe most valuable publicly traded U.S. company raised its quarterly dividend 11 percent to 52 cents per share and boosted its share repurchase program to $140 billion from $90 billion announced last year.\n\nTogether, Apple estimated that would mean returning $200 billion to shareholders by the end of March 2017. It ended the quarter with $193.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up more than $15 billion from the last quarter.\n\nEven so, that was \u201ca bit lower than expectations,\u201d said Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi.\n\nApple said net income for the fiscal second quarter rose to $13.57 billion, or $2.33 per share, from $10.22 billion, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts had expected earnings per share of $2.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nOverall revenue rose to $58.01 billion in the second quarter ended March 28, from $45.65 billion a year earlier. That beat Wall Street\u2019s expected revenue of $56 billion.\n\nApple said it expected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $46 billion to $48 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 average forecast of $47 billion."
