        "body": "TOKYO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Nikkei share average fell in choppy trade on Tuesday morning with investors skittish in the face of volatile oil prices and the Fed\u2019s momentous interest rate hike decision expected this week.\n\nApple Inc\u2019s component suppliers slid after Morgan Stanley forecast a drop in iPhone sales in the next fiscal year. TDK Corp tumbled 3.9 percent, Murata Manufacturing Co dropped 2.3 percent and Nitto Denko Corp fell 2.8 percent.\n\nThe Nikkei dropped 0.8 percent to 18,737.27 in midmorning trade after briefly flirting with positive territory.\n\nWhile investors widely expect the Fed to announce its first rate hike in nearly a decade on Wednesday, they are also waiting for commentary from policymakers about what will happen next.\n\n\u201cInvestors remain jittery before the event, but after some correction, the market will likely provide bargain hunting opportunities,\u201d said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities. \u201cA U.S. hike signals a U.S. economic recovery, and it is generally positive to the Japanese market.\u201d\n\nSelling on global cyclical stocks such as exporters reflected investors\u2019 sour risk stance on Tuesday. Toyota Motor Corp shed 0.7 percent, Nissan Motor Co dropped 1.2 percent and Panasonic Corp fell 1.1 percent.\n\nFinancials were also lower, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropping 1.9 percent, Mizuho Financial Group sliding 1.7 percent and Nomura Holdings declining 0.7 percent.\n\nToshiba Corp outperformed, rising 1.0 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that it plans to cut up to 7,000 jobs to streamline operations in the wake of an accounting scandal. Responding to the report, the company said it is considering various restructuring options, but nothing has been decided.\n\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.7 percent to 1,516.96 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 0.8 percent to 13,641.04.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Samsung took to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday in a last-ditch effort to pare back the more than $548 million in damages it must pay Apple for infringing the patents and designs of the iPhone.\n\nSamsung\u2019s petition must first be accepted for review by the Supreme Court. It is the latest step in a long-running patent lawsuit between the rival companies that epitomized the global smartphone wars.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) paid Apple Inc (AAPL.O) $548.2 million on Monday, fulfilling part of its liability stemming from a 2012 verdict for infringing Apple\u2019s patents and copying the iPhone\u2019s look.\n\nIn its petition to the high court, Samsung said it should not have had to make as much as $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone\u2019s rounded-corner front face, bezel, and gridded icons.\n\nIt said that awarding total profits from the sale of its devices with those designs, even if they relate only to a small portion of the phone, allows for \u201cunjustified windfalls\u201d far beyond the inventive value of the patents.\n\n\u201cA patented design might be the essential feature of a spoon or rug. But the same is not true of smartphones, which contain countless other features that give them remarkable functionality wholly unrelated to their design,\u201d Samsung told the high court.\n\n\u201cSamsung is escalating this case because it believes that the way the laws were interpreted is not in line with modern times,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nApple did not address the new petition, but said in a statement, \u201cWe make these products to delight our customers, not for our competitors to flagrantly copy.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean electronics company\u2019s quest to limit damages to Apple comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., the nation\u2019s top patent court, in May stripped about $382 million from the $930 million Samsung owed following the 2012 verdict. The appeals court said the iPhone\u2019s appearance could not be protected through trademarks.\n\nAnother trial over remaining damages relating to some of Samsung\u2019s infringing products in the case is set for next spring.\n\nIn its petition on Monday, Samsung also told the Supreme Court that juries should not award damages on certain \u201cfunctional\u201d aspects of designs, such as flat screens, which allow for the reading of documents, or rounded corners, which make phones easier to slip into a pocket."
