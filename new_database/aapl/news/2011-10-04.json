Apple stock was up 1.7 percent just ahead of the event.\n\nThe iPhone 5, which is expected to be faster, thinner and have a larger screen, arrives just in time for the crucial holiday shopping season.\n\nIt is expected to be loaded with the updated iOS5 software that Apple unveiled in June.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel confirmed that it will sell the next version of Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone, ending months of speculation about whether it would become the third U.S. operator to sell the popular device.\n\nBut the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider would not say whether its iPhone would come with a flat-fee service for unlimited data use - an offering analysts see as Sprint\u2019s only hope for making its iPhone more competitive than rivals.\n\nSprint shares closed up 5 percent after the confirmation, recouping some losses from the previous day when investors fled due to worries about the cost of the device to Sprint, which has been shedding subscribers and posting quarterly losses for several years.\n\nWhile carrying the device should help Sprint keep subscribers from fleeing to other operators, some analysts worried whether the costs would outweigh the benefits because Apple phones come at a steep premium to other devices.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge gamble for Sprint and people are justifiably worried that they won\u2019t be able to make any money doing it. It\u2019s not a company that\u2019s in great financial shape right now,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King.\n\nAnalysts questioned how Sprint will be able to find the money to pay a premium to Apple on top of its obligations to pay back billions of dollars in debt and its plan to spend about $5 billion on an network upgrade in coming years.\n\nThe day before the phone was announced Sprint shares fell 10 percent after a Wall Street Journal report that the money-losing company committed to buy 30.5 million iPhones from Apple over the next four years and would pay $500 to subsidize each phone, leading it to lose money on the device until 2014.\n\nSprint and Apple have declined to comment on that story.\n\nBut since carriers always end up paying a premium for Apple phones, the addition of a third U.S. iPhone distributor also highlights Apple growing power in the U.S. wireless market, said Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement.\n\n\u201cThe more skews Apple has out there and the more distribution partners, the more market share they\u2019ll take. It\u2019s generally taking more profits from the carriers,\u201d he said.\n\nOn top of this worry investors and gadget fans were less than enthusiastic about the iPhone 4 product upgrade that Apple unveiled on Tuesday.\n\nAT&T Inc, Verizon Wireless -- a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc -- and Sprint are expected to begin taking pre-orders for the iPhone 4S on October 7.\n\nUnlike Sprint, neither Verizon nor AT&T offer unlimited data services. Analyst John Jackson of CCS Insight was skeptical that enough consumers would move from AT&T or Verizon Wireless to Sprint to make the expense worthwhile.\n\n\u201cEven with unlimited data Sprint will have a challenge here,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWill it be sufficient mass to move the needle? I think it\u2019s questionable.\u201d\n\nConcerns about Sprint also dragged down Clearwire Corp, which is majority-owned by Sprint. Clearwire, which needs billions of dollars in funding to finish building its own network, saw its shares fall 11 percent to $2.15 on Nasdaq.\n\nWorry about Sprint may put Clearwire\u2019s \u201cviability into question, especially if you thought Sprint was going to wind up buying them,\u201d Stifel\u2019s King said.\n\nSprint shares closed up 5 percent at $2.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday but were still below their $3.04 close on Friday before the Wall Street Journal report about Sprint\u2019s commitment to Apple."

        "body": "TORONTO (Reuters) - Shares in Research In Motion ended 2 percent higher in yo-yo trade on Tuesday after rival Apple hinted at threats to RIM\u2019s core corporate market, but failed to wow fans and investors with its latest iPhone.\n\nThe BlackBerry maker\u2019s stock started the day with a surge of nearly 10 percent on talk that it had hired an investment bank revived speculation could be a takeover target.\n\nBut the stock then reversed course, slumping to its lowest in almost six years, as Apple CEO Tim Cook said major corporations were mulling a switch to the iPhone and iPad and spoke about iMessage, a real-time instant messaging service that could threaten the popular BlackBerry Messenger.\n\nCook said 93 percent of Fortune 500 companies are testing or deploying the iPhone, and 92 percent are considering or using the iPad - developments that could give Apple an edge in the corporate market where RIM\u2019s BlackBerry made its name.\n\nApple also said iMessage would be available on suddenly cheaper iPhone 4 and 3GS models.\n\nBut with Apple launching only an incremental iPhone improvement, RIM shares recovered and closed 2.4 percent higher at $21 on the Nasdaq. Apple stock ended lower.\n\nBoth Messenger and its secure corporate email system have been big draws for RIM in the past. But the company has rapidly lost market share in the United States as customer switch to sleeker models from Apple or powered by Google\u2019s Android operating system.\n\nAvian Securities analyst Matthew Thornton said traders likely exited RIM short positions - bets that RIM\u2019s share price would fall further - on the morning\u2019s takeover speculation and then shorted the stock again ahead of the Apple event.\n\n\u201cYou figure Apple is going to tout things that are going to reflect negatively on RIM, and they did,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRIM shares have come back a couple of points because they (Apple) didn\u2019t announce an iPhone 5 and it wasn\u2019t as exciting as people thought,\u201d Thornton said.\n\nRIM\u2019s shares fell as low as $19.29 on the Nasdaq, the first time the shares have dipped below $20 on a stock-split adjusted basis since late 2005.\n\nRIM\u2019s shares have slumped more than 60 percent this year after a series of profit warnings and dismal sales of its PlayBook tablet computer, which the company had hoped would compete with the hugely popular iPad.\n\nThat depressed valuation has made RIM shares more volatile, and they move wildly on any type of speculation.\n\nThe shares jumped last week on chatter that activist investor Carl Icahn had taken an interest in the company and would agitate for change.\n\nRIM faces other threats as well, with carriers in North America willing to subsidize Apple\u2019s iPhones to a greater degree than other handsets. That means consumers can get an iPhone at a similar cost to cheaper BlackBerry devices.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Canada\u2019s largest wireless carrier, Rogers Communications, said it was launching a program to enable corporate customers to use Apple and Google Android devices to send secure business email.\n\nSeparately, RIM has registered 3 million shares for use in an employee stock plan, a six-fold increase on its existing program, the company said in a regulatory filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nHaving more shares available as employee compensation may help morale at a challenging time for RIM, which said earlier this year it was cutting 11 percent of its workforce.\n\nThe company ran into trouble with both the SEC and the Ontario Securities Commission over its stock option plan for the period between 1996 and 2006."

Its latest iPhone, the 4S, offers faster data-processing and downloads, as well as voice-powered software. This may not have lived up to the most feverish expectations of investors: Apple shares fell while the market rallied. But it will do more than enough to create headaches for companies ranging from Research In Motion to American Greetings.\n\nSmartphones started by devouring the personal digital assistant, as any former Palm Pilot aficionado can testify. They terrorized the market for fixed-line phones, which are now in sharp decline. Apple\u2019s newest gadget shows just how hungry smartphone makers, and Apple in particular, are to eat rivals\u2019 lunches.\n\nThe new iPhone\u2019s camera offers sharply better video. That will further hurt sales of digital still and video cameras. Its software allows easy and free texting to other Apple devices. That\u2019s bad news for telephone operators, who make fat margins on such services. Instant messaging has also been the killer app for BlackBerry users.\n\nApple also unveiled a function that lets users digitally create their own greeting cards and send them in physical form. That may not excite Apple\u2019s most ardent fans, but it was enough to send shares of card-makers American Greetings and International Greetings reeling. Oh, and the new iPod Nano allows runners to track their performance, which will take a chunk out of the market for personal fitness monitors and shoes with sensors.\n\nIn a sense, though, these are the easily quantifiable effects of the new iPhone. The device also comes with voice-powered software allowing users to search the Internet, answer queries, take dictation or set up phone commands. It\u2019s hard to judge how effective this software is until it actually hits the shelves. But investors on the lookout for Apple\u2019s creative-destructive impact are surely drawing up a new list of victims."

Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), notably, is growing global shipments several times faster than Apple and is now estimated at within a hair\u2019s breadth of catching up in worldwide market share.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 16 months and all you\u2019ve got is an A5 processor in the existing iPhone 4,\u201d BGC Partners\u2019 analyst Colin Gillis said of the new Apple phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a mild disappointment, but they\u2019re still going to be selling millions of units.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 4S\u2019s voice commands -- for sending messages, searching for stock prices and other applications -- caught the attention of several analysts who argued it could profoundly change the user experience.\n\nKnown as \u201cSiri\u201d, the technology already exists on Android but experts say Apple\u2019s integration was more fluid -- a hallmark of the company.\n\nWhether such high-tech wizardry is enough to make the iPhone 4S a must-have in consumers\u2019 eyes and set it apart from the competition, remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that Siri is sufficient to make or break a purchase decision,\u201d said John Jackson, an analyst at CCS Insight. \u201cIt\u2019s a better mousetrap. History tells us users don\u2019t use this technology in great numbers.\u201d <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNew iPhone has similar specs to rivals [ID:nN1E79312Y]\n\nWhile the iPhone 4S sports many of the features leaked in tech blogs before Tuesday, it lacked the \u201cwow\u201d factor that some were hoping for to sustain the popularity of the brand.\n\nIn some ways, Apple may have been a victim of past success. Product launches by Jobs, now chairman, had been some of the hottest events on the tech calendar.\n\nThe iPhone, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Apple\u2019s sales, has been a success since it came out in 2007, making Apple one of the world\u2019s top electronics companies.\n\nCook said Apple has made significant inroads into the corporate market, with more than 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies testing or using its iPhones and iPads. The news sent shares of BlackBerry maker RIM RIMM.O down nearly 3 percent at one point. Google shares finished 1.3 percent higher.\n\nThe iPhone 4S will cost $199 with pre-orders starting Oct. 7. Apple also cut the price of the older iPhone 4 to $99, and said an even older \u201c3GS\u201d model will be available for free to customers who sign a long-term contract.\n\nThat could help Apple expand into developing markets such as Asia, Samsung\u2019s backyard. And it might allow Apple to take a bite out of a low-end market it had eschewed.\n\n\u201cApple is hitting Nokia when it\u2019s vulnerable. How many billions of people in emerging markets would love to have an iPhone? These are a growing demographic,\u201d said YCMNet Advisors CEO Michael Yoshikami.\n\nTuesday\u2019s iPhone event took place at Apple Central -- the same venue where the iPod was introduced years ago -- versus the larger, splashier venues of more recent choice, such as downtown San Francisco\u2019s Moscone center.\n\nThe event, though as usual choreographed to a tee, lacked the oomph and pizazz of Apple events in years past and sorely missed the star power that Jobs brought to the unveilings.\n\nHeading into the event, many on Wall Street had questioned Cook\u2019s ability to lead the company as Jobs had. In terms of stage presence, Jobs was a tough act to follow.\n\nWhile it did little to alleviate concerns about whether the company would stay a creative force to be reckoned with without its founder and visionary at the helm, analysts say Tuesday\u2019s proceedings hinted at Apple\u2019s new team-based approach.\n\n\u201cWhat he did is let the team shine through,\u201d said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. \u201cWhat we may see is a somewhat different style, and frankly a healthy style that says: Look, this is a team that works together, there\u2019s a deep bench, it\u2019s not just one person.\u201d\n\nTwitter users were not impressed with the phone, though.\n\n\u201cPlease note I will be selling some \u2018S\u2019 stickers for $0.99 so iPhone 4 owners have a cheaper upgrade option,\u201d wrote HAL9000 on Twitter.\n\nTomlinsonr tweeted, \u201cI\u2019ll have a double helping of \u2018meh\u2019 with a side of \u2018whatever\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe latest version of the iPhone comes as the economy slows and competition intensifies. People activate more than 550,000 Android-based devices -- including tablets -- each day.\n\nNielsen data shows the iPhone was No. 2 in the United States with a 28 percent market share, with Android at 43 percent.\n\nGlobally, iPhone shipments rose 9.1 percent in the second quarter while Nokia\u2019s plummeted more than 30 percent, handing the top spot to Apple with a market share of 18.4 percent, according to IHS iSuppli. Samsung, whose shipments grew faster, is coming on strong with a market share of 17.8 percent.\n\nDespite disappointment online, analysts said the phone is superior to many rival offerings.\n\n\u201cVoice recognition has been on Google and Blackberry devices for years, but Apple will make it much more usable,\u201d said Morgan Keegan analyst Tavis McCourt.

        "body": "HELSINKI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - On the day that Apple launches the fifth generation of its ubiquitous iPhone, the once mighty Nokia is still weeks away from mounting a fightback.\n\nStephen Elop, chief executive of the Finnish mobile phone maker, on Tuesday promised to unveil its first Windows-based smartphones this quarter but it remains to be seen whether the they will start shipping in time for Christmas.\n\nThe launch is expected to coincide with the annual Nokia World trade show in London at the end of October and deliveries would need to start in early November to get the phones to consumers during the peak of the holiday-sales season.\n\nIn the past, Nokia has often unveiled phones half a year before deliveries started, but the company has said it plans to change that.\n\nAddressing a technology fair, Elop argued there is room for the new Windows smartphone in an already fiercely competitive market dominated by the iPhone and models based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, which has won around half the market globally in the last few years.\n\n\u201cOur belief is that there is a clear opportunity for an alternative ecosystem,\u201d Elop said.\n\nMeanwhile Apple, which only entered the cellphone industry in 2007, is expected to unveil the new version of its iconic iPhone later on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYou could argue that one of the most fundamental disruptions that the industry faced happened around 2007 ... when the iPhone was introduced,\u201d Elop said. \u201cThe iPhone did something disruptive. It introduced a new level of experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey created a new bar... that all of a sudden everything else was measured against,\u201d he said.\n\nThe iPhone 5 -- expected to be faster, thinner and larger-screened -- will arrive on the shelves just in time for the holidays. It should sustain Apple\u2019s smartphone momentum and help ward off a challenge from close runner-up Samsung, which uses Android.\n\nMarket sentiment towards Nokia has improved recently. According to Thomson Reuters data, with 14 analysts currently rating Nokia shares a buy and 17 saying sell. This compares with 9 on buy and 21 on sell at the start of September.\n\nBut the Windows phone has got it all to do.\n\n\u201cMr Elop is talking. I want action - show me the products and show me when you will ship them,\u201d said John Strand, founder of Danish mobile industry consultancy Strand Consult.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest phone maker by volume, left in the dust by Apple and Google, announced a high-risk new strategy at the start of the year to ditch its home-grown Symbian software for a deal with Microsoft .\n\nThe switch -- which Elop likened to jumping from a burning oil platform -- meant a tough eight-month changeover period during which investors fretted about the delay between the announcement and the first of its Windows smartphone models reaching the market.\n\nAlready struggling with falling sales and profits, Nokia has seen its shares halve since the announcement on worries it would lose so much market share before the new phones come out that it might never make up lost ground.\n\nBoth Apple and Samsung outstripped Nokia in the smartphone market last quarter, ending its 15-year reign at the top of that market. Nokia\u2019s quarterly phone sales to end-June dropped 20 percent at a time when the market grew 10 percent\n\nThe firm is expected to report a 0.02 euros loss per share for the September quarter, according to estimates gathered by Thomson Reuters.\n\nElop, who took over a year ago, last week unveiled a plan to cut 3,500 jobs in his second major restructuring in six months. The redundancies come on top of cost cut plans set out in April, which included laying off 4,000 staff. . (Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Chris Wickham and Sophie Walker)"

        "body": "* Investors worry if Sprint can make money from iPhone\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel (S.N) confirmed that it will sell the next version of Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) iPhone, ending months of speculation about whether it would become the third U.S. operator to sell the popular device.\n\nBut the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider would not say whether its iPhone would come with a flat-fee service for unlimited data use - an offering analysts see as Sprint\u2019s only hope for making its iPhone more competitive than rivals.\n\nSprint shares closed up 5 percent after the confirmation, recouping some losses from the previous day when investors fled due to worries about the cost of the device to Sprint, which has been shedding subscribers and posting quarterly losses for several years.\n\nWhile carrying the device should help Sprint keep subscribers from fleeing to other operators, some analysts worried whether the costs would outweigh the benefits because Apple phones come at a steep premium to other devices.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge gamble for Sprint and people are justifiably worried that they won\u2019t be able to make any money doing it. It\u2019s not a company that\u2019s in great financial shape right now,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King.\n\nAnalysts questioned how Sprint will be able to find the money to pay a premium to Apple on top of its obligations to pay back billions of dollars in debt and its plan to spend about $5 billion on an network upgrade in coming years.\n\nThe day before the phone was announced Sprint shares fell 10 percent after a Wall Street Journal report that the money-losing company committed to buy 30.5 million iPhones from Apple over the next four years and would pay $500 to subsidize each phone, leading it to lose money on the device until 2014.\n\nSprint and Apple have declined to comment on that story.\n\nBut since carriers always end up paying a premium for Apple phones, the addition of a third U.S. iPhone distributor also highlights Apple growing power in the U.S. wireless market, said Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement.\n\n\u201cThe more skews Apple has out there and the more distribution partners, the more market share they\u2019ll take. It\u2019s generally taking more profits from the carriers,\u201d he said.\n\nOn top of this worry investors and gadget fans were less than enthusiastic about the iPhone 4 product upgrade that Apple unveiled on Tuesday. [ID:nN1E7931NK]\n\nAT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Wireless -- a venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) -- and Sprint are expected to begin taking pre-orders for the iPhone 4S on Oct. 7.\n\nUnlike Sprint, neither Verizon nor AT&T offer unlimited data services. Analyst John Jackson of CCS Insight was skeptical that enough consumers would move from AT&T or Verizon Wireless to Sprint to make the expense worthwhile.\n\n\u201cEven with unlimited data Sprint will have a challenge here,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWill it be sufficient mass to move the needle? I think it\u2019s questionable.\u201d\n\nConcerns about Sprint also dragged down Clearwire Corp CLWR.O, which is majority-owned by Sprint. Clearwire, which needs billions of dollars in funding to finish building its own network, saw its shares fall 11 percent to $2.15 on Nasdaq.\n\nWorry about Sprint may put Clearwire\u2019s \u201cviability into question, especially if you thought Sprint was going to wind up buying them,\u201d Stifel\u2019s King said.\n\nSprint shares closed up 5 percent at $2.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday but were still below their $3.04 close on Friday before the Wall Street Journal report about Sprint\u2019s commitment to Apple.

        "body": "New Apple CEO Tim Cook began his first product launch on Tuesday at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino by trumpeting all of his company\u2019s successes, but after almost an hour of self-promotion and smaller updates, Apple unveiled its latest iPhone, the 4S.\n\nAs recently as a few weeks ago, many Apple followers had expected an announcement of the iPhone 5, but recent indicators suggested consumers would get a more modest update. It ended up somewhere in between, and the news actually leaked first on a Japanese retail site.\n\nAesthetically, the iPhone 4S looks identical to the iPhone 4, but internally it is brand new. Thanks to a new chip already present in the iPad 2, the new iPhone runs seven times faster.\n\n\u201cDespite competitors trying really hard to copy the iPhone,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s Senior Vice President for Worldwide Product Marketing. \u201cThey just haven\u2019t been able to do it.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Steve Jobs: I Can No Longer Meet My Duties as Apple's CEO\n\nThe iPhone 4S will be available Oct. 14 on Verizon, AT&T and a new addition, Sprint. It will also come with a new camera system, improved battery life and, as expected, a voice control system named \"Siri.\"\n\nFor now, it appears Siri will be limited to specific commands, but don't let that fool you, since it has the capability to understand quite a lot.\n\nWant to schedule events or read text messages? It can do it for you, so long as you direct it -- no hands required. You can ask whether you need a raincoat, and what time it is in a foreign city. And you can set an alarm.\n\nAlso read: Apple's iPhone Voice App: Revolution or Another Disappointment?\n\nAll of this voice capability is bound to leave some uneasy. When Schillar asked Siri \"Who are you,\" it responded \"I am a humble personal assistant.\u201d\n\nStill, many of the tech writers in attendance seem to have been very impressed.\n\nApple also priced these new phones quite aggressively, offering the 16 GB for $199, the 32GB for $299 an the 64GB for $399.\n\nWhile the phone was the big news of the day, much of the program was dedicated to other new products.\n\nSchillar announced a slate of updates to the iPod Nano and iPod Touch, while Scott Forstall, Senior Vice President of iPhone Software, unveiled the latest update to Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 5. It will become available on Oct. 12 and offers more than 200 new features, including the Apple Newstand.\n\nThe Newstand gives publishers like the New York Times, Conde Nast and National Geographic a special home for their portable publications.\n\nWhile the lack of an iPhone 5 may be disappointing to some, Cook made it clear from the start that Apple feels pretty confident about its achievements. He announced the continued expansion of Apple stores, the robust sales figures for Apple products and the strong reviews most things with the Apple-logo have garnered.\n\nThe market did not immediately share Cook's optimism, as Apple's stock is down almost five percent. Still, that is not all that unusual for a company announcing new products.

        "body": "CUPERTINO, California (Reuters) - The launch of Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone 4S showed just how much fans miss the showmanship of Steve Jobs. But it also gave observers a hint as to how new helmsman Tim Cook might prefer to do things.\n\nCEO Cook ably directed the proceedings but unlike his long-time boss and master showman, quickly handed over the reins to his executive team for the actual unveiling of the new phone.\n\n\u201cWhat he did is let the team shine through,\u201d said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. \u201cWhat we may see is a somewhat different style, and frankly a healthy style that says: Look, this is a team that works together, there\u2019s a deep bench; it\u2019s not just one person.\u201d\n\nThe event, though as usual choreographed to a tee, lacked the oomph and pizzazz of Apple events in years past and sorely missed the star power that Jobs brought to the unveilings.\n\nAnd it did little to alleviate concerns about whether the company would stay a creative force to be reckoned with beyond the next year or so without its founder and visionary at the helm.\n\n\u201cThere is every reason to be confident the company will not miss a beat operationally,\u201d said John Jackson, analyst with CCS Insight, after attending the event. \u201cIn terms of product execution and in terms of vision, it\u2019s fair to wonder out aloud if Apple is going to maintain its pace of innovation in terms of products and business model.\u201d\n\nIn the intensely competitive mobile arena, branding and marketing play critical roles. Part of Apple\u2019s mystique came from Jobs, a Silicon Valley icon who infused Apple launch events with his charisma, turning them into some of the hottest dates on the tech calendar.\n\nThe widespread disappointment with the new iPhone 4S had little to do with the device itself or the presentations but more to do with the fact that expectations had run high for a completely new phone leading up to the event, analysts said.\n\n\u201cTim Cook did fine,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of these things where he set the world on fire. He held up his end of the bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is striking about this is that this is the beginning of a new era at Apple and today\u2019s event brought that home,\u201d he added. \u201cThe bench picks up where Steve lets off.\u201d\n\nJobs has long been a larger than life figure inside and outside the company he co-founded.\n\nFamous for his \u201cone more thing\u201d mantra to introduce the show-stopper, Jobs\u2019 showmanship captivated the audience. His product unveilings were watched by millions of fans and dissected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nExpecting Cook to replicate Jobs\u2019 on-stage presence is unfair to the operations maven, perhaps even unwise, analysts said.\n\n\u201cI see nothing here that says the formula\u2019s not working,\u201d said Gillett. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly different characters running the game. It will be most interesting to see how it plays out in the market, when the products ship.\u201d\n\nInstead, Apple\u2019s new product-reveal strategy appears to be to highlight the team. And few felt Apple needed to tweak its winning formula for product launches in the absence of Jobs, including conveying ahead of time what to expect at the event.\n\nCook, who strode onstage from the get-go, outlined a brief introduction to the company\u2019s achievements and its momentum in a conversational tone and seemed at ease.\n\nThe iPhone 4S itself was unveiled by Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller, while software head Scott Forstall and Apple veteran Eddy Cue talked about the updates to the operating system and iTunes.\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s launch took place for the first time in years at Apple central on 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California. This kept at bay many of the Apple faithful who typically turn up in droves and eliminated the carnival-like atmosphere that often surrounds its product introductions.\n\nAccess to the event itself was limited to the number of people they could squeeze into Apple\u2019s on-campus auditorium.\n\nSome observers had already remarked that Apple\u2019s invitation to the event lacked the typical suspense -- the invite clearly stated \u201cLet\u2019s talk iPhone\u201d -- as opposed to the cryptic one-liners that had accompanied past missives.\n\n\u201cSteve has a charisma and a stage presence that\u2019s unmatched,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, analyst with Creative Strategies. \u201cBut having said that, in the end, even though Steve\u2019s stage presence is important, what you really care about is what he said.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in that context, they nailed it\u201d on Tuesday, he added. \u201cThey communicated well not only the vision and the direction, but what they\u2019ve got in the way of new products and why the consumer would want it.\u201d"

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook presided over the company\u2019s first major media launch since taking over from Steve Jobs in August, but the latest version of the iPhone he unveiled did not excite investors, sending its shares down as much as 5 percent.\n\nJobs did not appear at the event.\n\nThe following are immediate comments from analysts, tech experts and fund managers.\n\n\u201cThey could have called it iPhone 5. There are enough changes. The voice-recognition service -- if it works like reports on it did on stage -- is pretty impressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoice recognition has been on Google and BlackBerry devices for years, but Apple will make it much more usable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have three products in the market at the same time for the first time ever. That will allow them to price the 3GS down. That will be free now.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Sprint it can\u2019t hurt. We\u2019ll see what they can do to differentiate it. They\u2019ve customers who won\u2019t be moving to AT&T and Verizon now. If they keep the same data plan for the iPhone this will be the cheapest way to own an iPhone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone that\u2019s had an iPhone 3G is going to want to upgrade. Anyone that\u2019s got an iPhone 4 I think will want all of the new features in this system, especially what they\u2019re doing with the Siri personal assistant, and then what they\u2019re doing with the video and the imaging.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve just mastered manufacturing that form factor (iPhone 4) and demand is higher than it\u2019s ever been. For them to, in the middle of the year, decide to put out a brand new design and then have to refigure out how to do another 100 million of that. That\u2019s a hard job.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is much more practical, and a smarter thing to do, to stay with the existing design and completely redo the insides instead. Because it means that they can now keep up with demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody can replace Steve. Steve has a charisma and a stage presence that\u2019s unmatched. But having said that, in the end, even though Steve\u2019s stage presence is important, what you really care about is what he said. And in that context, they nailed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince Apple is known for its industrial design and known as a hardware company, there were expectations of another form factor or that it would support LTE. But we\u2019ve also seen Apple do very well with designs that are more tried and true.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can take much better photos and video. The new graphics capacity opens new doors for developers. Where Apple differentiates itself is the quality of applications available for the platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new price points, coupled with a much greater strategic emphasis on iCloud and iMessaging, suggests a shift to a volume game rather than high margin products.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they didn\u2019t move to a new phone they can shift to a volume game by adjusting the prices, expanding the installed base of iOS users and start to sew up more of your computing experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe danger for these guys is that they\u2019ve done a product refresh in a market where the product cycle is shorter and shorter. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any defections really but the danger is that the prospective iPhone customer is going to be distracted by that shiny new device from Samsung or whoever it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody has caught Apple in terms of service integration. As true as that may be, it\u2019s a tougher thing to market to consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, there was probably slight disappointment. People were hoping for a bigger screen, just given what\u2019s out there from many of the competitors, namely HTC and Samsung.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a software perspective, they really made some big enhancements. Siri -- that\u2019s really impressive. Many users, for example, when they\u2019re driving, would like to do some simple commands, like have email read to them. It makes a ton of sense. This is an area people actually want.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s really going to help them -- they\u2019re going to roll this out pretty quickly, to every territory by December. In the past, we\u2019ve seen it take longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are disappointed that they didn\u2019t change the hardware more. There were rumors of a bigger screen and a thinner model, prompted by the usual spate of cases coming out of Asia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who may be disappointed by the lack of hardware changes are missing the major point here. Apple for the first time is in a position where they can target all of Nokia\u2019s phones in emerging markets by dropping the price of their phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple has always been about selling premium products. Not anymore. Apple now has cheaper products that will probably come out in pre-paid plans. They dropped the price of the iPhone 3GS today. The iPhone 3GS will be seen a lot in parts of Asia where you only see Nokia right now. 3GS costs zero on a contract and if it\u2019s not in a contract, the price point will be pretty nominal.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple is hitting Nokia when it\u2019s vulnerable. How many billions of people in emerging markets would love to have an iPhone?. These are a growing demographic. You are essentially targeting Apple customers who may move up over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an Apple investor this is positive news, but for technology people this may be disappointing. There\u2019s a lot of cool technology out there that doesn\u2019t get enough scale to be interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly people are disappointed. People got overexcited for the launch and there was a lot of hype. But the 4S looks like a great product. It will make a lot of people very happy but certainly people were expecting an iPhone 5.\u201d\n\n\u201cSiri looks fantastic. It looks really nice if you\u2019re a person who finds yourself stuck in traffic. While driving you can now read your text messages without worrying about breaking any laws. Whether or not it\u2019ll be groundbreaking, I\u2018m not so sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that surprised us was the 4S got the faster A5 processor. It\u2019s a faster phone than the 4, that was the only surprise but that wasn\u2019t exactly a shocker.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was exciting to be in the room and way more intimate than the Moscone Center where their events are usually held. It was a couple hundred journalists there. You could hear the shutters from the photographers going off quickly near the end. People thought Tim Cook would say those iconic words, \u201dand one more thing,\u201c and when he didn\u2018t, people were disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people will be disappointed as they were hoping to see something that looks different, but this is an improvement across the board on hardware. Where they really raised the bar is on Siri.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are disappointed because people were expecting the iPhone 5 and they got the iPhone 4S. The confusing element is the iPhone 4S has everything they thought the 5 would have. It has the new chip and it\u2019s integrated with the new cloud service.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately they are calling it the 4S so the market thinks Apple is behind in the release schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of consumers who were expecting an iPhone 5 around the corner, which will keep some people on the sidelines. It sends some confusion into the market even though it seems like a great phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in line with expectations but the stock\u2019s trading off. It\u2019s kind of funny -- if they have gone and called it the 5, the stock would have been fine, but they\u2019re calling it the 4S, which is a disappointment to some.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a faster chip. The form factor is the same as the prior one which might be a disappointment also to some people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not disappointed at all. It\u2019s exactly as you\u2019d expect, but next year they need to look more carefully at the prepaid market.\u201d\n\n(When asked if surprised that Jobs did not make an appearance) \u201cNo. they\u2019ve been clear that Tim Cook would lead the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like how they made a big deal of the new antennas, because of the history of the death grip on the initial iPhone 4. Switching between one radiating structure and the other will definitely help. Users should be able to get a pretty good signal at all times. They are finally using the potential of that kind of design.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think the new phone was going to have LTE. Apple doesn\u2019t do tech for tech\u2019s sake, only to enhance user experience. While LTE is gathering steam it\u2019s still too early from a chipset point of view and also from network deployment point of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 16 months and all you\u2019ve got is a A5 processor in the existing iPhone 4.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mild disappointment, but they\u2019re still going to be selling millions of units.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of significant improvements, the software, the A5 processor that\u2019s dual core.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain segment of consumer that\u2019s always going to be buying the latest device based on form factor to be seen to have the latest. This isn\u2019t going to satisfy these people.\u201d"

        "body": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - On the day that Apple (AAPL.O) launches the fifth generation of its ubiquitous iPhone, the once mighty Nokia NOK1V.HE is still weeks away from mounting a fightback.\n\nStephen Elop, chief executive of the Finnish mobile phone maker, on Tuesday promised to unveil its first Windows-based smartphones this quarter but it remains to be seen whether the they will start shipping in time for Christmas.\n\nThe launch is expected to coincide with the annual Nokia World trade show in London at the end of October and deliveries would need to start in early November to get the phones to consumers during the peak of the holiday-sales season.\n\nIn the past, Nokia has often unveiled phones half a year before deliveries started, but the company has said it plans to change that.\n\nAddressing a technology fair, Elop argued there is room for the new Windows smartphone in an already fiercely competitive market dominated by the iPhone and models based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, which has won around half the market globally in the last few years.\n\n\u201cOur belief is that there is a clear opportunity for an alternative ecosystem,\u201d Elop said.\n\nMeanwhile Apple, which only entered the cellphone industry in 2007, is expected to unveil the new version of its iconic iPhone later on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYou could argue that one of the most fundamental disruptions that the industry faced happened around 2007 ... when the iPhone was introduced,\u201d Elop said. \u201cThe iPhone did something disruptive. It introduced a new level of experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey created a new bar... that all of a sudden everything else was measured against,\u201d he said.\n\nThe iPhone 5 -- expected to be faster, thinner and larger-screened -- will arrive on the shelves just in time for the holidays. It should sustain Apple\u2019s smartphone momentum and help ward off a challenge from close runner-up Samsung, which uses Android.\n\nMarket sentiment towards Nokia has improved recently. According to Thomson Reuters data, with 14 analysts currently rating Nokia shares a buy and 17 saying sell. This compares with 9 on buy and 21 on sell at the start of September.\n\nBut the Windows phone has got it all to do.\n\n\u201cMr Elop is talking. I want action - show me the products and show me when you will ship them,\u201d said John Strand, founder of Danish mobile industry consultancy Strand Consult.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest phone maker by volume, left in the dust by Apple and Google, announced a high-risk new strategy at the start of the year to ditch its home-grown Symbian software for a deal with Microsoft (MSFT.O).\n\nThe switch -- which Elop likened to jumping from a burning oil platform -- meant a tough eight-month changeover period during which investors fretted about the delay between the announcement and the first of its Windows smartphone models reaching the market.\n\nAlready struggling with falling sales and profits, Nokia has seen its shares halve since the announcement on worries it would lose so much market share before the new phones come out that it might never make up lost ground.\n\nBoth Apple and Samsung (005930.KS) outstripped Nokia in the smartphone market last quarter, ending its 15-year reign at the top of that market. Nokia\u2019s quarterly phone sales to end-June dropped 20 percent at a time when the market grew 10 percent\n\nThe firm is expected to report a 0.02 euros loss per share for the September quarter, according to estimates gathered by Thomson Reuters.\n\nElop, who took over a year ago, last week unveiled a plan to cut 3,500 jobs in his second major restructuring in six months. The redundancies come on top of cost cut plans set out in April, which included laying off 4,000 staff.."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc beefed up its new iPhone with faster chips and better cameras, seeking to set its handset apart from the rising tide of Google Android smartphones.\n\nBut the one feature that got the most \u201coohs\u201d and \u201cahhs\u201d from the audience at Tuesday\u2019s iPhone unveiling was the built-in voice-recognition technology, dubbed \u201cSiri\u201d.\n\nApple demonstrated a variety of scenarios in which users of the new iPhone 4S seemed to hold a conversation with the device, managing calendar appointments, finding restaurants and inquiring about the weather.\n\n\u201cThat was a pretty big step forward,\u201d said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett, who attended the launch at Apple headquarters. \u201cTo be able to just converse with your gadget. You\u2019ve got more options than just poking and swiping at it with your finger.\u201d\n\nWhether such high-tech wizardry is enough to make the iPhone 4S a must-have in consumers\u2019 eyes, and set it apart from the competition, remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that Siri is sufficient to make or break a purchase decision,\u201d said John Jackson, an analyst at CCS Insight. \u201cIt\u2019s a better mousetrap. History tells us users don\u2019t use this technology in great numbers.\u201d\n\nVoice recognition technology isn\u2019t new. Software companies have offered technology allowing people to do dictation, with varying results, on their personal computers for more than a decade. Even low-tech gizmos like vehicle-GPS units made by Garmin and others can be voice-enabled.\n\nGoogle introduced voice recognition technology to its Android smartphone software more than a year ago, and the company recently introduced a voice-recognition capability into its flagship Web search engine.\n\nBut Gillett said Apple had taken the technology beyond merely recognizing spoken words. The Siri technology could take actions based on people\u2019s words, making it closer to a true \u201cpersonal assistant,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring demonstrations, an Apple executive asked the phone whether he needed a raincoat today, and the phone responded: \u201cIt sure looks like rain today.\u201d\n\nA separate video of Siri technology in action, screened during the event, depicted a jogger telling his phone to book an appointment at noon, with the phone responding, in a robotic female voice, that he already had an appointment at that time.\n\nSiri will initially be available with support for English, French and German with more languages soon, Apple said. The company acquired Siri, the maker of the technology, early last year.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone, first introduced in 2007, is the No. 1 selling smartphone in the world. But phones based on Google Inc\u2019s Android operating system, which is available for free to handset vendors such as Motorola, HTC Corp and Samsung Electronics, have a greater combined market share than Apple\u2019s iPhones.\n\nInside iPhone 4S is a dual-core A5 processor, designed by Apple, with improved graphics capabilities for video games, as well as special image processing capabilities for improving photo and video performance. The camera got a boost to 8 megapixel resolution, up from the prior model\u2019s 5 megapixels.\n\nApple also provided more details on forthcoming Internet-based \u201ccloud\u201d features on Tuesday. Users of iPhones and iPad tablets will be able to store their music, photos and other data on Apple\u2019s remote servers, similar to services offered by Google and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nFor all the hardware improvements, Gartner analyst Van Baker said it was the Siri technology that will really make the iPhone 4S stand apart.\n\n\u201cIt is very cutting-edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have raised the bar.\u201d"

        "body": "If Apple really has its Siri voice app down, we\u2019re looking at a revolution in user interfaces. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re looking at one more frustrating detour in the search for a computer that responds intelligently to voice commands.\n\nTuesday, Apple announced its latest iPhone update, and the voice app was a highlight of the show. The app apparently has the software smarts to hear \u201cDo I need a raincoat today?\u201d and respond with \u201cLooks like rain today.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Apple Unveils New iPhone -- and It's Not iPhone 5\n\nBut, of course, it\u2019s one thing to demonstrate an app before an adoring crowd, and quite another for it to work with your voice in a moving car. Apple\u2019s voice recognition on the iPhone until now has been abysmal. Try getting it to consistently pick out your favorite songs or artist. It\u2019s like using the \u201cshuffle\u201d function.\n\nUse Google\u2019s voice search to find the phone number for your favorite restaurant or a movie, and you might just get lucky. But then again, you probably won\u2019t, so pretty soon you\u2019ll probably be pulling over to the side of the road.\n\nApple has been mining this particular fantasy since at least 1987, when former CEO John Scully posited the idea of \u201csoftware agents\u201d that could access massive databases for near-instant responses to user questions. Apple famously created \u201cKnowledge Navigator\u201d videos that showed a bow-tied \u201cbutler\u201d who performed everyday tasks for a lucky professor.\n\nApple\u2019s first attempt at that vision, the Newton, was a flop. It\u2019s next attempt, the iPad, took well over a decade to materialize.\n\nSo has Apple nailed it this time with Siri?\n\nIf it has \u2014 and I define \u201cnailed\u201d as getting your requests right well over 90% of the time, just like good dictation software \u2014 then you will quickly see a revolution in the way people interact with their mobile phones. Even the fastest texter, after all, can\u2019t text as quickly as they can talk; and no one presumably wants to be texting in a moving car.\n\n\u201cTell me what time 50/50 is playing in Culver City and where,\u201d would be amazing stuff. It would very likely become a standard app on PCs, smart TVs and all kinds of other appliances in the next few years.\n\nBut if Siri only gets it right around 50 percent of the time or so, it will become one more novelty that quickly wears out its welcome. You should know the answer within 24 hours of getting your iPhone 4S."
