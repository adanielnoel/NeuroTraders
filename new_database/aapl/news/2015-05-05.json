        "body": "(Reuters) - General Electric Co on Monday announced collaborations with Qualcomm Inc and Apple Inc as it uses digital technology and the growing appetite for data to reinvigorate its 130-year-old lighting business.\n\nWith chipmaker Qualcomm, GE is offering retailers a way to connect with shoppers\u2019 smartphones through technology embedded in LED light bulbs, the company said. One use of the \u201cindoor positioning\u201d technology could be to transmit customized coupons to shoppers depending on their store location.\n\nGE also said it will produce an LED bulb compatible with Apple\u2019s yet-to-launch connected-device platform HomeKit. The bulb can change colors to align with the natural rhythms of the body.\n\nThe tie-ups underscore GE\u2019s plans to dive into the emerging and increasingly competitive market for connected lighting that integrates with smart devices.\n\nWhile GE sees an opportunity in selling energy-efficient LED bulbs, it will seek to use sensors and other technology embedded in LEDs to the advantage of consumers, businesses and cities, said Beth Comstock, who leads GE Business Innovations.\n\nServices offered by GE stand to provide revenue that could offset pressure should the LED bulb business become more commoditized.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s now a data stream from light that is going to create opportunity to be more productive,\u201d said Comstock, in her first interview about the lighting strategy since September, when the unit became part of GE\u2019s innovations division.\n\nGE itself is undergoing a sweeping overhaul, jettisoning the bulk of its finance division to focus on big-ticket industrial products such as jet engines and power turbines.\n\nSome analysts have speculated the U.S. conglomerate will divest lighting after deciding last year to sell its appliances segment and moves by Siemens and Philips to hive off lighting units. GE Lighting totaled about $2.5 billion in revenue last year, 2.3 percent of the company\u2019s overall industrial sales.\n\nComstock said lighting fits smoothly with GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt\u2019s desire to marry software and analytics with GE\u2019s various industrial equipment, which GE calls the \u201cIndustrial Internet.\u201d\n\n\u201cLEDs plus software, it helps GE continue its Industrial Internet expansion and I think the lighting business has a big role in GE\u2019s future because of that,\u201d Comstock said.\n\nAlong with traditional lighting manufacturers, the \u201cintelligent lighting\u201d market is drawing companies that manage other building controls such as Honeywell, and start-ups focused on lighting controls, according to Jesse Foote, analyst at Navigant Research.\n\n\u201cThere are so many kinds of companies getting into the space,\u201d Foote said."
