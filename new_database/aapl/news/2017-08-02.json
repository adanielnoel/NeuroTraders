        "body": "TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Nikkei share average posted modest gains on Wednesday, supported by strong earnings reports from local companies and by a rally in Apple suppliers after it reported robust profits.\n\nThe Nikkei was up 0.4 percent at 20,058.24 points by mid-morning, after rising 0.3 percent on Tuesday.\n\nApple suppliers soared, with Murata Manufacturing rising 3.2 percent, Taiyo Yuden rising 3.3 percent and TDK Corp gaining 1.9 percent after Apple Inc delivered surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings and signaled that its upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone lineup is on schedule.\n\nHonda Motor Co soared more than 4 percent after Japan\u2019s No.3 automaker raised its full-year operating profit forecast thanks to solid demand in Asia.\n\nWhile Japanese stocks have been supported by strong earnings from companies, traders say the Nikkei will continue to hover around the 20,000 mark because investors have been cautious about the risk of a further rise in the yen.\n\n\u201cSo far, companies are reporting better-than-expected results, but such positive catalysts are offset by worries about a strong yen,\u201d said Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWhen the Nikkei is trading in a narrow range, retail investors are buying when the index is in the lower level in the range. Foreign investors would have chased the market higher if the yen weakens, but that\u2019s not happening right now.\u201d\n\nAlthough the dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 110.490 yen during Asian trade, it touched a near seven-week low of 109.920 yen overnight.\n\nThe dollar has been weighed down by political turmoil gripping Washington and largely uninspiring U.S. economic data, which is adding to uncertainty about the pace of future U.S. Federal Reserve policy tightening.\n\nBucking the strength, mining stocks underperformed after oil prices fell, with rising U.S. fuel inventories pulling U.S. crude back below $50 per barrel.\n\nThe broader Topix advanced 0.2 percent to 1,631.61 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.2 percent to 14,524.34.

        "body": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has asked the Indian government to extend tax breaks to its suppliers if India seeks to become a manufacturing hub for iPhones and its components.\n\nGovernment officials say meeting this request would require a new policy that applies fairly to other device makers, too.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has been in talks with Indian officials since May of last year, when CEO Tim Cook and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to set up a production base in the country that goes beyond just assembling the devices, as happens today.\n\nThe two sides have been discussing a list of \u201cprerequisites\u201d that Apple submitted in October, including duty exemption on raw materials for manufacturing components and capital equipment for 15 years for it to make iPhones from scratch in India.\n\nThe company has told the government it would be bringing in a host of these ancillary units when it sets up operations to cater to India, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing smartphone markets, a top government official said.\n\n\u201cThey want the same treatment to be given to the component manufacturers; the tax concessions, they want everything. But then some kind of policy will have to be evolved,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe demand could further delay Apple\u2019s plans to penetrate the Indian market, the world\u2019s third largest for smartphones behind the United States and China, but where it has only a 2 percent share.\n\nThe company is looking to India after sales in the Greater China region, once a major growth driver, slid 14 percent year-on-year to $10.7 billion in the three months ended April 1.\n\nIn May, Apple, working with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Winstron, began assembling the iPhone SE in Bengaluru.\n\nThe plan that Modi and Cook ordered the two sides to work on, however, envisages manufacturing a full range of iPhones for the domestic market, as well as for export.\n\nFor India, which would only be the second iPhone production center after China, such an investment would be a big win for Modi\u2019s Make-in-India campaign.\n\nIt would also spawn a vast network of suppliers, in the way that India\u2019s auto ancillary sector took off to feed Maruti Suzuki India\u2019s (MRTI.NS) production line over three decades ago.\n\nAnother official, who has led efforts to secure foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, said Apple\u2019s proposal to build its phones in India was being examined favorably by the government.\n\n\u201cMy view is that India needs to support Apple to create an ecosystem, which was done for Maruti. This helped to build the automobile and auto component industry in India,\u201d the official said, seeking anonymity in line with government policy.\n\n\u201cInitial support will pay rich dividends in the long run and facilitate innovation, design and manufacturing of electronics components in India,\u201d the official added.\n\nApple competitors such as South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and China\u2019s Oppo could also benefit from a broader policy review as they, too, currently have predominantly assembly operations in India.\n\nAnother government official familiar with the matter said it would be difficult for India to agree to Apple\u2019s request for a customs holiday for just its own operations in India.\n\nCustoms duties have already been slashed in order to make India a hub for handset assembly lines, the official said.\n\nThat move has encouraged phone makers to set up such facilities in India, and so the duty structure cannot be changed for one company, the official said."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday delivered surprisingly strong fiscal third-quarter earnings and signaled that its upcoming 10th-anniversary phone lineup is on schedule, driving the stock up 6 percent to an all-time high in after-hours trading.\n\nThe stock climbed above its intraday record high to $159.10 after the company reported better-than-expected iPhone sales, revenue and earnings per share. The stock price move was expected to help drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the 22,000 mark on Wednesday.\n\nApple also said it hit a milestone of 1.2 billion iPhones sold.\n\nThe April-June quarter is traditionally a soft one for Apple as the market waits for the September launch of new iPhone models. But Tuesday\u2019s results show that iPhone buyers may be less inclined than they once were to delay purchases until a new model is out.\n\nThe iPad product lines also showed unexpected strength, service revenue continues to grow at a healthy clip, and even the much-maligned Apple Watch showed a 50 percent sales increase.\n\nApple is widely tipped to adopt higher-resolution OLED displays for the latest iPhone, along with better touchscreen technology and wireless charging - which could come with a $1,000 plus price tag.\n\nThe phone is expected to launch in September.\n\nThe company forecast total revenue of between $49 billion and $52 billion for the current fourth quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $49.21 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe forecast \u201cmakes it fairly certain that at least some new iPhone models will be released on the normal schedule,\u201d said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all new models will go on sale then, or that they\u2019ll all be in abundant supply, but I would think it means that at the very least the successors to the current phones will be available.\u201d\n\nBut Bob O\u2018Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple releases cheaper models before the premium models in its 10th anniversary phone lineup, the cheaper models could dampen sales of more expensive units released closer to the holidays.\n\nThe company said iPhone sales rose 1.6 percent to 41.03 million in the third quarter ended July 1, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of 40.7 million units, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones a year earlier.\n\nBut a lower average iPhone selling price of $606, well below Wall Street expectations of $621, caused iPhone revenue to come in at $24.8 billion, below expectations of $25.5 billion.\n\nApple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters the weak price was partly explained by Apple lowering the flow of inventory by 3.3 million units, which he said were \u201centirely at the high end of the range.\u201d\n\nApple reports how many phones it sells to retailers, not how many phones it sells to consumers, what is known as a sell-in basis. When factoring how many existing \u201chigh end\u201d phones the company cleared out of retail inventory, Maestri said average selling prices were higher.\n\nThe company\u2019s net income rose to $8.72 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $7.80 billion, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue rose to $45.41 billion from $42.36 billion in the quarter, typically the company\u2019s weakest, beating expectations of $44.89 billion.\n\nApple said revenue from emerging markets excluding China grew 18 percent, a bright spot. But sales from the Greater China region fell 9.5 percent to $8 billion in the latest quarter, as consumers switched to newer domestic offerings.\n\nThe decline was smaller than recent quarters. Apple\u2019s Maestri said mainland China revenue was flat, as were iPhone sales in the mainland. Sales of other Apple products rose in mainland China and were also up in Taiwan.\n\n\u201cThe decline from a market standpoint was concentrated in Hong Kong, which is a place that has been really affected by a reduction in tourism because the Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar,\u201d Maestri said.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook also directly addressed the company\u2019s decision to remove so-called VPN apps from the App Store in China. Those apps help Chinese users circumnavigate government internet restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries we follow the law wherever we do business,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. This particular case, we\u2019re hopeful that over time the restrictions we\u2019re seeing are lessened, because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate.\u201d\n\nStrong iPad sales of $4.9 billion - almost $1 billion above Wall Street expectations - and a 21.6 percent jump in the company\u2019s services business that includes the App Store also helped boost revenue. In particular, Apple said that Walmart Stores Inc would buy 19,000 iPads to train as many as 225,000 employees. The company also said it increased production of AirPods, its wireless headphones.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook declined to directly address U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that Apple will build three new factories in the U.S., instead citing the company\u2019s job creation efforts and a $1 billion U.S. manufacturing fund.\n\nCook also hinted that Apple\u2019s experiments with self-driving cars may include ambitions that extend beyond cars. He said the company is making a \u201cbig investment\u201d in autonomous systems.\n\n\u201cFrom our point of view, autonomy is sort of the mother of all AI projects,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAnd the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one, but there are many different areas of it. And I don\u2019t want to go any further with that.\u201d"
