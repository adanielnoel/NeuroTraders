        "body": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials have agreed to investigate Qualcomm Inc\u2019s allegations that Apple Inc infringed on patents with its iPhone 7 and other devices, the U.S. International Trade Commission said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ITC will make its decision \u201cat the earliest practicable time\u201d and will set a target date for completing its investigation within the next 45 days, the commission said in a statement.\n\nQualcomm filed the complaint in early July, asking U.S. trade regulators to ban certain models of the iPhone that contain so-called broadband modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks, that were not made by Qualcomm. Apple began using broadband modem chips made by Intel Corp in the iPhone 7.\n\nQualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but says the way Apple uses them in the iPhone does.\n\n\u201dWe look forward to the ITC\u2019s expeditious investigation of Apple\u2019s ongoing infringement of our intellectual property and the accelerated relief that the commission can provide,\u201d Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement.\n\nIntel declined to comment. Apple pointed to Chief Executive Tim Cook\u2019s earlier comments that Qualcomm had not yet offered it \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d licensing terms for Qualcomm\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,\u201c Cook told investors in May on the company\u2019s earnings call, his most recent public comment on the topic. \u201dI think that there\u2019s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.\u201d\n\nAs the ITC considered whether to take up the case, a group representing Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc sided last month with Apple, saying Qualcomm\u2019s request to bar the import of some iPhones would hurt consumers.\n\nIn turn, Qualcomm accused the group of \u201ca coordinated effort aimed at misdirecting\u201d the trade regulators. It said Apple was free to choose chips from a variety of vendors without necessarily infringing Qualcomm\u2019s patents.\n\nThe fight before trade regulators in Washington is one of several major legal battles involving Qualcomm and Apple. The two companies have cases pending before separate federal courts in California, and Qualcomm also faces a complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nAnalysts are watching the ITC case closely because the trade regulator moves more quickly than many courts and could deliver a decision ahead of the pending lawsuits."
