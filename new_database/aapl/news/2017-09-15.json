        "body": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - The dip in Taiwan\u2019s stock market following the launch of the iPhone X may be a mere pause before more rallies to come as suppliers of Apple Inc. reap the benefits of Apple\u2019s newest smartphones, said an executive of Taiwan\u2019s biggest fund house.\n\nJeff Chang, chairman of Cathay Securities Investment Trust, sees the much-anticipated release of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X as having tremendous upside to bolster earnings potential of suppliers, driving up their share prices and the overall market, already a top performer in the region this year.\n\nChang\u2019s confidence is such that he said his firm intends to increase its already substantial exposure to Taiwan\u2019s Apple suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe are so bullish on Apple suppliers that they already comprise 30 percent of our portfolio, and we plan to increase that,\u201d the chairman of Cathay, which manages T$500 billion ($16.7 billion) in client assets, told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cShares of Apple suppliers are the most important holdings that Taiwan\u2019s fund industry must have in their portfolios,\u201d Chang said.\n\nApple rolled out its iPhone X, a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Chief Executive Tim Cook called \u201cthe biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.\u201d The company also unveiled the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which resemble the iPhone 7 line but have a glass back for wireless charging and other new features.\n\nSince the launch, the Taiwan market and shares of Apple suppliers including Largan Precision have pulled back as some analysts expressed concerns the launch had been priced in, and offered few surprises, while the iPhone X\u2019s $999 price tag might be prohibitively expensive.\n\nBut Chang takes a different view, and suggests that the dip following the launch may only be an intermission before another rallying act for the Taiwan market.\n\n\u201cThese stocks have staged quite a rally. They usually pull back by 10 percent following product launches,\u201d said Chang, 51. The chairman said he expects the new iPhones to drive shipments of up to 300 million units by December 2018, exceeding Apple\u2019s current annual shipment rate.\n\nApple\u2019s smartphones have been a major factor in Taiwan\u2019s stock market and its export-driven economy, as the U.S. firm gets many of its components from Largan, Hon Hai Precision Industry and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). \u201cWe think the new iPhones will be a big hit,\u201d Chang said.\n\nThe broader market rose 14 percent so far this year, while TSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract chip maker, jumped 20 percent, Largan surged nearly 50 percent and Hon Hai rose 36 percent."
