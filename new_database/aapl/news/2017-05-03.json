Ford dropped 3.8 percent, while General Motors fell 3.3 percent.\n\n\u201cI think the auto sales numbers have caused the market to take a step back,\u201d said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cI think people are reading too much into that. There\u2019s a fear that is building on last quarter\u2019s GDP numbers that the consumer is pulling back, which we don\u2019t think is the case.\u201d\n\nData last week showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. But, Schutte said strong corporate earnings have helped hold the market up.\n\n\u201cWith earnings rising, that is backdrop for positive stock returns moving forward.\u201d\n\nOverall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nAt 11:02 a.m. EDT (1502 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.62 points, or 0.1 percent, at 20,935.08.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 0.18 points, or 0.00 percent, at 2,388.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.78 points, or 0.01 percent, at 6,090.82.\n\nSix of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the consumer staples index\u2019s 0.48 percent fall leading the decliners.\n\nCVS Health was down 2.8 percent at $79.80, while Archer Daniels Midland fell 1.9 percent to $42.08, after reporting results.\n\nDow component Pfizer was down 1.5 percent at $33.29 after the drugmaker\u2019s quarterly revenue missed estimates, pulling down the healthcare index, which fell 0.3 percent.\n\nThe technology sector was up 0.33 percent. Apple hit a record high for the second straight day. The iPhone maker is due to report results after the close of market.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices tumbled 17.3 percent to $11.26 after the chipmaker\u2019s second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns.\n\nCoach rose as much as 11 percent to a nine-month high of $43 after the handbag maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,371 to 1,369. On the Nasdaq, 1,576 issues fell and 1,063 advanced.\n\nThe S&P 500 index showed 37 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 111 new highs and 32 new lows.

This should give Apple more fuel even after it rallied 56.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to Monday\u2019s close.\n\n\u201cActive fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York.\n\nOnly about a third of large-cap core mutual funds are ahead of the 6.7 percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index for the year to date, leaving portfolio managers struggling to prove their worth at a time when low-priced index funds and exchange traded funds that mimic benchmarks continue to take market share, Rosenbluth said.\n\nThe UBS ranking was based on institutional investment in individual stocks. The total dollar holdings in a stock were compared to the size of the overall fund portfolio to calculate the stock\u2019s \u201cinvestor weight.\u201d This was later compared with \u201cthe relevant equity index benchmark to form the active weight.\u201d\n\nFor its part, global fund managers\u2019 \u201cinvestor weight\u201d of Apple stood at 1.3 percent while their \u201cactive weight\u201d positioning was negative 0.6 percent, UBS data showed. In a regulatory filing, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, up from just from 15.2 million shares three months earlier.\n\nShares of Apple are up about 26.8 percent for the year to date in anticipation of a new iPhone model expected to be released in September marking the 10th anniversary of its flagship product.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which account for 69.4 percent of Apple\u2019s total revenue, were larger than expected in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, helping mitigate concerns about consumers switching to cheaper alternatives or holding on to their current phones longer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not seeing a slowdown in demand ahead of a major upgrade year, and there\u2019s a potential for higher costs and margins with the new model,\u201d said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) sold fewer iPhones than expected in the first three months of the year, but that bare statistic hides an important bright spot for the company. The average selling price of an iPhone grew more than it has since the days of the iPhone 6.\n\nApple does not break out figures for how many of each model it sells, but executives pointed to the premium-priced iPhone 7 Plus, which sells for up to $969 fully loaded, as the key to boosting the amount it gets on average for each phone.\n\nThe average selling price of iPhones is important to Apple because the smartphone market is maturing and its growth slowing. Apple\u2019s ability to get more cash for each phone sold is critical to growing its profits.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on the company\u2019s earnings conference call on Tuesday, in response to a question about how supply of its top-end phone was constrained during the holiday shopping season.\n\n\u201cThe demand was much stronger for the 7 Plus than we had predicted, and so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred this past quarter.\u201d\n\nThe popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus model represents a triumph for Apple with a new departure: packing a unique feature into its most expensive iPhone.\n\nThe iPhone 6 Plus differed from its smaller sibling only in screen size, but the 7 Plus model has a physically different camera that enables what Apple calls \u201cportrait mode\u201d for taking shots with a blurred background - a feature more commonly found on large, expensive digital cameras.\n\nIt is a strategy Apple could use again. Many analysts believe the company will reserve certain features for the premium-priced model of its next, eagerly awaited iPhone - such as a higher-quality display - that could sell for more than $1,000.\n\nSo far, customers seem to be willing to pay more for the extra camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, which is one reason that Apple made slightly more revenue selling slightly fewer iPhones in the latest quarter than a year ago, for an average price of $656.\n\nThat price was 2 percent higher than 12 months ago, the best improvement in a year. During 2016, selling prices even went into a decline, year on year, during the iPhone 6s cycle after soaring on the release of the original iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which introduced larger screens to the Apple lineup for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is the average selling price should not fall,\u201d said Anil Doradla, a research analyst with William Blair & Co. \u201cI have full confidence that it won\u2018t. Apple just doesn\u2019t cut pricing to gain market share. It\u2019s not in their DNA.\u201d"

The company said it expects gross margins next quarter between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent, versus analysts\u2019 expectation of 38.3 percent, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cNAND and DRAM (memory chips) are under pressure right now in terms of some price pressure. We saw that in the March quarter and expect that to continue into the June quarter, but for all the other commodities, we see prices declining,\u201d Maestri said."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A measure of stocks across major markets globally inched up to a record high on Tuesday, lifted by gains in Europe amid corporate and economic strength, while crude futures tumbled as prices breached key technical levels.\n\nA broad index of European stocks rose to its highest since August 2015, boosted by company earnings and as a survey of factory activity in the euro zone jumped to its highest since April 2011. French blue chips hit their highest in nearly a decade and Germany\u2019s DAX set a record high.\n\nRobust results have helped lift share prices across the globe this year, with major U.S. indexes at or near record levels. First-quarter profits of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index are expected to have risen 13.9 percent, the strongest rise since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data.1.50.6\n\nApple shares fell 1.2 percent to $145.75 in extended trading after the iPhone maker reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales.\n\n\u201cThe economy is doing better within Europe, but these also tend to be global companies,\u201d said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock.\n\n\u201cThe main reason why we are optimistic is because European companies are extremely well plugged in to benefit from the global reflation story, from China and U.S. growth picking up.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.43 points, or 0.17 percent, to 20,949.89, the S&P 500 gained 2.84 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,391.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.76 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,095.37.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.75 percent to end at a near 21-month high and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.27 percent to an all-time high.\n\nThe U.S. dollar hit a six-week high of 112.30 Japanese yen as traders anticipated that despite some recent weak data the Federal Reserve would prepare markets for an interest rate increase in June in its statement following a policy meeting this week.\n\nThe yen weakened 0.13 percent against the greenback to 111.99 per dollar.\n\nThe Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady after its two-day meeting that began Tuesday, as it pauses to examine more economic data, but may hint it is on track for an increase in June.\n\nTraders do not anticipate a hike on Wednesday but are currently forecasting a 65.2 percent chance of a 25-basis-point hike at the Fed\u2019s June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nU.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last up 11/32 in price to yield 2.2874 percent, from 2.327 percent late on Monday, ahead of the Fed statement on Wednesday.\n\nWTI plunged on reports of rising output in the United States and extended losses on technical selling, while Brent crude oil prices fell to the lowest in over five months, erasing all the gains since OPEC agreed to cut production at the end of November.\n\nU.S. crude fell 1.84 percent to $47.94 per barrel and Brent was last at $50.77, down 1.46 percent on the day.\n\nGold touched a three-week low of $1,251.37 an ounce as demand for the safe-haven asset waned. Spot gold was little changed at $1,256.36 an ounce."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s announcement of a suite of new education products on Tuesday shows the company\u2019s determination to reverse a major shift that has taken place in U.S. classrooms in recent years: for most educators and school districts, Google\u2019s Chromebook is now the computer of choice.\n\nThe Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users.\n\nIn 2016, mobile devices running Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google\u2019s Chrome operating system accounted for 58 percent of the U.S. market for primary and secondary schools, according to Futuresource Consulting.\n\nThe Microsoft products introduced Tuesday, including a new version of its Windows operating system, software to boost collaboration among students and a new Surface laptop, clearly show the influence of the Chromebook, industry watchers say.\n\n\u201cThe success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,\u201d said Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of Clever, an education technology company. \u201cThere\u2019s so much investment into the space \u2013 it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nFor years after the release of the Chromebook in 2011, Apple Inc and Microsoft stuck to their strategies of offering slightly modified and discounted versions of their products for educators.\n\nBut the Chromebook\u2019s low price--it starts at $149-- and easy management proved irresistible to many schools. Google also saw a key chance to expand its market share several years ago with the approach of an online testing mandate in the United States.\n\nTo capitalize on the opportunity, the company created a \u201ctest mode,\u201d which restricts access to the rest of the web while students complete assessments, said Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management at Google.\n\nThe preparations paid off: Sales of the Chromebook jumped tenfold between 2012 and 2013, Sheth said.\n\nWhile Google manufactures some Chromebooks, the devices aimed at the education market are supplied by partners such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Acer Inc. The operating system is free for educators and hardware manufacturers, and Google sells schools an education package including device management and support for a $30 fee.\n\nFor Microsoft, Tuesday\u2019s event was the culmination of a campaign to emulate key aspects of the Chromebook strategy, said Mike Fisher, associate director for the education division at Futuresource Consulting.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s hardware partners are now selling hybrid tablet-laptop devices based on the Surface design starting at $189. Microsoft executives boasted that the operating system announced Tuesday boots up rapidly, a hallmark of the Chromebook.\n\nThe company also introduced a new code-builder addition to its Minecraft education edition to help students learn coding skills through the popular game.\n\nFor Microsoft, the test will be how easily it can explain its offering to educators, Fisher said.\n\n\u201cThe Google education ecosystem is quite straightforward,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Microsoft, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts.\u201d\n\nApple, for its part, has lowered the price of the iPad to $299 for education customers and made it possible for students to share devices, in addition to simplifying management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about trying to reach every teacher and every student,\u201d said Susan Prescott, a vice president of product management and marketing at Apple.\n\nDespite Google\u2019s U.S. dominance, its position is weaker in classrooms overseas, where many markets have not yet seen an impetus to embrace technology en masse, said Fisher of Futuresource Consulting.\n\nIn 2016, devices running Android and Chrome made up 23 percent of the mobile market outside the United States, compared with 65 percent for Microsoft\u2019s Windows, according to Futuresource."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple is playing some soothing iPhone hold music. The tech colossus sold nearly 51 million smartphones despite maturing markets and a resurgent Samsung following its exploding-battery crisis. App-store sales also grew nicely, and more dividends and buybacks are on the way. That should pacify investors until Apple rolls out the 10th anniversary edition of its pioneering device.\n\nSmartphone sales for all vendors globally have slowed, to only about 4 percent in the first quarter, according to research outfit IDC. In one way, that\u2019s a bad omen for $770 billion Apple. The iPhone generates more than 60 percent of its revenue and profit. At the same time, most customers have settled on either Android devices or Apple\u2018s.\n\nChief Executive Tim Cook is focused on milking these users in many ways. It\u2019s selling them more apps, storage, support and music. This recurring source of revenue is expanding quickly, at an 18 percent pace in the latest quarter, and now accounts for 13 percent of total sales. The larger, albeit intermittent, opportunity is persuading customers to add watches and wireless earpods to go along with their iPhones. There\u2019s also a steady need to replace cracked, waterlogged or ageing ones.\n\nThe biggest opportunity to extract cash from its devotees \u2013 and perhaps even to win over Android fans \u2013 is coming. Apple historically rolls out new iPhones in the autumn, and hints from the supply chain indicate it will be a big upgrade this time. That probably will help handset sales toward the end of the year, but also could mean lower revenue in the coming quarter as customers wait for the next iPhone iteration.\n\nApple shares have gained 27 percent since the start of the year, quadrupling the increase in the S&P 500 Index. Even after a dip in after-hours trading on Tuesday, the company still trades at about 16 times estimated 2017 earnings, a 15 percent discount to the broader market.\n\nThat seems excessive, given the power of the smartphone duopoly. What\u2019s more, Apple is throwing off enough cash to fund nearly $90 billion of additional capital returns by the end of March 2019 with plenty stored up to keep investing in new products. There should be more than enough there to keep investors humming along as they wait for what\u2019s next."

Those reports impressed analysts and fueled confidence in the sector, which has so far been the top performer on Wall Street in 2017.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the lion\u2019s share of the numbers, they\u2019re performing above expectations,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares of Apple worth about $41 million and shares of Facebook worth $68 million.\n\n\u201cIt gives validity to my position, which is that tech is, by far, the most exciting sector,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nShares of Facebook and Apple both hit record highs on Tuesday, up 0.53 percent and 0.75 percent respectively.\n\nSurges in Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley heavyweights have pushed the S&P 500 technology index up by 16 percent this year.\n\nAnd planned measures by President Donald Trump for steep corporate tax cuts and the easing of tax restrictions on profits made abroad would help Apple and other technology companies return more cash to shareholders.\n\nThe largest five Silicon Valley companies for years have been increasing their share of revenue and profits generated in the technology sector at the expense of smaller competitors.\n\nThose five players boosted their share of revenue among technology companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index to 46 percent in 2016, from 38 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data.
