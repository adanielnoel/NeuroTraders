        "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH has hired Ian Rogers, an Apple Inc iTunes senior director, to be its new head of digital, as part of the luxury group\u2019s drive to more fully embrace the Internet.\n\nIt marks one of the most high profile hires from the digital industry as fashion, jewelry and cosmetics brands race to build up teams able to engage online customers.\n\nPreviously, transfers went the other way around as Apple poached several luxury executives including Angela Ahrendts, former Burberry Chief Executive, and Paul Deneve, former boss of Saint Laurent, owned by Kering.\n\nLast year, L\u2018Oreal created the job of chief digital officer to expand its presence online and hired the Bulgarian-born and French-educated Lubomira Rochet who sits on the cosmetics group\u2019s executive committee.\n\nRogers ran Beats Music before the company was bought last year by Apple and then joined its iTunes team as a senior director.\n\nAs the tech giant rolled out Apple Music, its new music streaming service, Rogers oversaw the radio portion. Apple said in August that the service had attracted more than 11 million members during its free trial period, a response that music industry experts called respectable but not overwhelming.\n\nIn Rogers, Apple is losing a leader with a strong track record of innovation, said Ted Cohen, a former music executive who is now managing partner of TAG Strategic, a digital entertainment consultancy.\n\n\u201cHe is the smartest and most compassionate digital music guy I\u2019ve met in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s Apple\u2019s loss.\u201d\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRogers takes up his new job at LVMH in October.\n\nWhile luxury goods sales globally have slowed down in recent years to around 5 percent annually, luxury online sales have been rising by more than 20-30 percent, albeit from a very low base."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Despite objections from class counsel, a federal judge in California has sent roughly $4.5 million in uncashed checks from a settlement over alleged warranty breaches involving Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPods to states as unclaimed property.\n\nIn an order Friday, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco disagreed with co-lead class counsel from Chimicles & Tikellis and Fazio/Micheletti that he lacked the \u201clegal discretion\u201d to place into states\u2019 unclaimed property funds the nearly 19,000 unclaimed checks from the $53 million settlement with Apple.\n\nTo read the full story on WestlawNext Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/1PIxmeE"
