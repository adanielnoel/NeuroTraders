        "body": "(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday expressed strong doubts that he had the legal authority to order Apple Inc to access data on a locked iPhone that was seized as part of a federal investigation.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re asking them to do is do work for you,\u201d U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein told government attorneys at a hearing in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nOrenstein asked Apple and the U.S. Justice Department for arguments on the issue after the government sought an order compelling the company to unlock the phone. The government has obtained such orders before, and Apple has complied without objection.\n\nNonetheless, in response to Orenstein\u2019s request, Apple said such an order would be burdensome, in part because it would erode the trust of its customers. The company has also explained that it lacked the technical ability to unlock phones running its newer operating systems, iOS8 and iOS9, though the phone at issue in the case runs an older system.\n\nSaritha Komatireddy, arguing for the government, said the order it sought would essentially be the same as ordering Apple to turn over information.\n\nBut Orenstein said the request went further than that. He instead compared the order the government sought to one compelling a drug company to make a lethal injection drug over its conscientious objection, asking Komatireddy whether he would have the authority to do that.\n\nKomatireddy asked to respond in writing, adding that \u201cthe hypothetical is somewhat inflammatory.\u201d\n\nKomatireddy also questioned whether unlocking the phone would really be a burden for Apple, noting the company \u201chas been doing this for years without any objection.\u201d\n\nOrenstein later pressed Apple\u2019s lawyer, Marc Zwillinger, to explain the company\u2019s change of heart.\n\nZwillinger said the company had become more concerned about customer data in light of recent high-profile data breaches.\n\n\u201cRight now Apple is aware that customer data is under siege from a variety of different directions,\u201d he said.\n\nOrenstein asked both sides to submit additional letters to the court addressing his questions by Wednesday, and said he would rule as soon as he could.\n\nKomatireddy said at the hearing that the Drug Enforcement Administration and Federal Bureau of Investigation are taking part in the underlying investigation, which is not public.\n\nThe case is In re Order requiring Apple, Inc to assist in the execution of a search warrant issued by the court, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 15-mc-01902."

        "body": "LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said on Monday it will soon launch its own competitor to Apple Pay that will allow consumers to pay retailers using their smartphones in stores, and it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants.\n\nThe largest U.S. bank is the latest company to try to profit from the prevalence of smartphones, which many financial executives believe will one day be consumers\u2019 preferred way to pay for everything from milk and eggs at the supermarket to a rental car at an airport.\n\nThe companies that figure out how to convince consumers to stop pulling credit cards out of their wallets and start paying with their phones stand to earn vast sums by taking a percentage of the trillions of dollars that consumers spend annually.\n\nNo clear front-runner has emerged in the business yet. Chase believes its smart phone application, known as Chase Pay, has one key advantage: the caliber of retailers it has brought on board, Gordon Smith, chief executive of the bank\u2019s consumer business, told Reuters.\n\nChase has signed a deal with the Merchant Customer Exchange, a group of major retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, (WMT.N) the largest U.S. retailer, and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) to accept payments through the bank\u2019s technology.\n\nRetailers included in the Merchant Customer Exchange ring up more than $1 trillion of sales per year and have over 100,000 outlets.\n\nRivals like Apply Pay have struggled to sign up retailers to accept their payments. In June, Reuters interviewed the top 100 U.S. retailers and found that two-thirds said they did not plan to accept Apple Pay this year.\n\nApple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) Apple Pay\u2019s website lists Best Buy in its \u201cComing Soon\u201d section but has no mention of Wal-Mart.\n\nChase signed up the Merchant Customer Exchange mainly by promising to cut retailers\u2019 costs, Smith said. Whenever a consumer pays for something with plastic, the retailer pays fees to banks and credit card networks to process the transaction.\n\nChase is willing to accept a lower fee for Chase Pay transactions than for other transactions, and hopes to make up the difference by getting more volume over its network, Smith said.\n\n\u201cAs merchants give us more business, we will give them better pricing,\u201d Smith said in an interview. Chase declined to comment on how much it would cut fees.\n\nChase expects to market its product heavily in the middle of next year. Smith is speaking to retailers about Chase Pay at a conference about payments on Monday in Las Vegas.\n\nDavid Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, which tracks the card business, said JPMorgan\u2019s bid matters to players throughout the industry because of how many cardholder and merchant customers the bank has. \u201cThe whole thing is about scale, and Chase is a titan,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nChase Pay is also promising superior security, a critical selling point after retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) suffered from hacking attacks, Smith said. Longer term, Chase also hopes merchants will offer more discounts through Chase Pay, encouraging consumers to use the technology more.\n\nChase Pay will initially work for consumers that already have Chase credit, debit, and prepaid cards, Smith told Reuters in an interview. There are about 94 million of those cards outstanding now in the United States, and the bank has more spending on them than any other issuer. The app will work on Apple and Android-based phones.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer bank has already factored the system\u2019s near-term launch costs into its expense estimates, and expects the benefits to come over the medium to long term.\n\nThe bank will continue working with Apple Pay and other services even as it builds a rival, Smith said.\n\nChase Pay is just one of a series of companies trying to become the go-to payment technologies, including Apple Pay, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u2019s (005930.KS) Samsung Pay, and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Android Pay."
