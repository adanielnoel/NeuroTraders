        "body": "SHANGHAI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A small fire broke out on Sunday night on the roof of a factory complex where iPhones are assembled in China, but Taiwan-based tech giant Foxconn Technology Group, which runs the factory, said nobody was hurt and manufacturing was unaffected.\n\nThe fire took place at a plant in Zhengzhou, in Henan province, the key supplier to Apple Inc, according to a statement from Foxconn.\n\n\u201cThe fire was brought under control by the fire department shortly after it was reported. There were no injuries associated with this incident and there is no impact on the manufacturing operations of that facility,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nIn May 2011, a dust explosion at a Foxconn factory that made iPads in the western Chinese city of Chengdu killed three people and injured 15.\n\nFoxconn\u2019s listed unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co , which assembles the bulk of Apple\u2019s latest smartphones, saw its December revenues slump by a fifth and full-year sales miss expectations.\n\nThe results came amid growing concerns about slowing shipments of Apple\u2019s latest iPhone 6S models.\n\nApple is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below estimates on Tuesday for the first time in six quarters, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.
