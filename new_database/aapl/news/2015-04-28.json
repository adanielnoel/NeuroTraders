The iPhone 6 was launched last autumn in China with a number of carriers.\n\nWall Street hailed the results but share reaction was muted. Its shares rose 1.6 percent in after-hours trading to $134.52.\n\nApple sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, up 40 percent from the year-ago quarter, but down from the record-breaking holiday quarter. It sold 12.6 million iPads, down 23 percent from a year ago.\n\nApple\u2019s big screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been popular with customers worldwide, helping the company overtake rival Samsung (005930.KS) in global smartphone sales last quarter.\n\n\u201cA 60 million-plus iPhone number is a home run and will be cheered by the Street as this remains the bread and butter of Apple,\u201d said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nApple gave no sales figures for its recently released Apple Watch, but did say the current quarter was off to \u201can exciting start\u201d.\n\nCook said demand for the watch continued to be greater than supply, as it has been since pre-orders started earlier this month.\n\n\u201cFrom a demand point of view, it\u2019s hard to gauge when you don\u2019t have product in stores,\u201d said Cook on a conference call with analysts. Apple is only selling the watch online and in select third-party boutiques due to the large number of models and straps for the watch, which could become a logistics nightmare if it offered every permutation of the many varieties at already jam-packed Apple stores.\n\nThe most valuable publicly traded U.S. company raised its quarterly dividend 11 percent to 52 cents per share and boosted its share repurchase program to $140 billion from $90 billion announced last year.\n\nTogether, Apple estimated that would mean returning $200 billion to shareholders by the end of March 2017. It ended the quarter with $193.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up more than $15 billion from the last quarter.\n\nEven so, that was \u201ca bit lower than expectations,\u201d said Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi.\n\nApple said net income for the fiscal second quarter rose to $13.57 billion, or $2.33 per share, from $10.22 billion, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts had expected earnings per share of $2.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nOverall revenue rose to $58.01 billion in the second quarter ended March 28, from $45.65 billion a year earlier. That beat Wall Street\u2019s expected revenue of $56 billion.\n\nApple said it expected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $46 billion to $48 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 average forecast of $47 billion."

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.22 percent, to 96.704.\n\nAnother decline in rig counts helped U.S. oil prices rise modestly. U.S. crude was up 6 cents to $57.21 a barrel; Brent crude had pared losses, and was down 27 cents to $65.02 a barrel."
