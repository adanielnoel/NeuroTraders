Prices start at $999.\n\nFace ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple\u2019s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.\n\n\u201cBravo for your work!\u201d, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted.\n\nCook later met Macron, who has called for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.\n\n\u201cBravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,\u201d Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in back taxes from Apple.\n\nA French presidency official said Macron and Cook did not rake over the past and described the talks about regulating digital platforms and tax policy as constructive and forward-looking.\n\nAsked if they had discussed France\u2019s proposal to tax the revenue of big tech companies and not profit, the Macron adviser said: \u201cThey didn\u2019t go into specifics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tone was very open. This wasn\u2019t a posturing competition.\u201d Tech giants were under pressure from shareholders worried about reputational damage over how the companies arrange their taxes, the official added.\n\nEldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world\u2019s most highly valued company.\n\n\u201cThey (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,\u201d said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. \u201cFacial recognition is one of iPhone X\u2019s differentiating features.\u201d\n\nApple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.\n\nFranco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.PA), one of Europe\u2019s larger technology companies, is widely understood to be a supplier of sensors for the Apple iPhone 7 and forthcoming iPhone devices, but is barred by Apple from saying so."
