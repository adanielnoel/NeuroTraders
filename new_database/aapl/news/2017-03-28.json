        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court has ruled in favour of Apple in design patent disputes between the Cupertino, California company and a domestic phone-maker, overturning a ban on selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in China, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nLast May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple\u2019s Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales.\n\nApple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office\u2019s ban to court.\n\nThe Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili\u2019s design patent for 100c phones.\n\nThe court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights.\n\nRepresentatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua.\n\nIn a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones.\n\nApple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection.\n\nThe Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board\u2019s decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal."
