        "body": "* Tablets can have multiple users with own home pages\n\n* Will hit U.S. stores in November\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc took a shot at archrival Amazon.com on Wednesday, unveiling its own lighter and thinner hi-definition tablets that can accommodate multiple users in a bid to win a bigger share of the exploding tablet market.\n\nThe largest U.S. bookstore chain introduced the new devices with price tags ranging from $199 for a 7-inch Nook HD tablet with 8 gigabytes of memory, to $299 for a 9-inch Nook HD+ tablet, similar in size to Apple Inc\u2019s market-leading iPad, with 32 GB of memory. IPad prices are roughly twice as high for similar devices.\n\nThe new Nooks are the latest entrants in the fight for sales of tablets and e-readers - and the digital content like books, movies and magazines that goes with them. Barnes & Noble has staked its future on its digital business as the company faces an overall industrywide drop in the sales of physical books.\n\n\u201cA key growth area is to get their existing customer base onto the digital platform,\u201d Forrester Research analyst Sarah Rotman Epps told Reuters, saying the new devices were competitive with similar products by Amazon in terms of features and pricing.\n\nBarnes & Noble faces formidable competition from Amazon, which can use its Prime shipping service and amazon.com site to draw users to its Kindle tablets, and Apple, which has sold tens of millions of iPads.\n\nTo keep pace, Barnes & Noble added innovative features that would allow each a family to share a Nook tablet, with each user able to create a home page and customize preferences, the first table to do so. There are also parental controls that can prevent kids from reading \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d or go shopping on the digital store.\n\nThe company is also launching a new video-streaming and download service for Nook, narrowing the gap with Amazon and Apple, which offer more content on their devices.\n\nAt a media event in Manhattan on Tuesday, officials said the company had emphasized features such as image resolution and page-turning technology given the needs of its basic customers, book and magazine readers.\n\n\u201cWe are playing in the tablet space, but reading is at our core,\u201d Barnes & Noble Chief Executive William Lynch told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nThe 7-inch tablet weighs 11.1 ounces. Its larger sibling is 18.2 ounces, making it lighter than the iPad and making them both more appropriate for reading, he added. The iPad weighs about 23 ounces.\n\nThe top U.S. bookstore chain launched its first Nook device, a basic e-reader, in 2009 and has held its own with deep-pocketed rivals Amazon, Apple and Google Inc. That success has allowed it to garner as much as 30 percent of the U.S. electronic-books market.\n\nBarnes & Noble\u2019s new devices, available for pre-order on Wednesday, will ship in October and be in U.S. stores in November. They will be on sale in Britain beginning in late November at chains including Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose.\n\nin early New York Stock Exchange trading. On Nasdaq, Amazon dipped 0.3 percent, while Apple fell 1.7 percent.\n\nThe tablet market is among the fastest-growing sectors of the technology industry. Research firm Gartner forecasts that sales will almost double this year, to 118.9 million units.\n\nBarnes & Noble\u2019s latest Nooks will appear in its nearly 700 stores as well as chains Best Buy Co Inc, Target Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Target and Wal-Mart have decided to no longer carry Amazon\u2019s Kindles, giving the Nook an edge at thousands of retail locations.\n\nAmazon.com Inc earlier this month unveiled its own HD tablets. It launched its first last year and says it has a 22 percent share of the U.S. market.\n\nWith the new Nooks, Barnes & Noble is also taking aim at Apple, whose iPad is far more expensive, because there is room in the market for a strong tablet at a lower price, Lynch said.\n\nQuestions about the Nook\u2019s long-term viability arose last month after Barnes & Noble reported that Nook revenue including ebooks last quarter was up only 0.3 percent, hurt by price decreases early in the summer. That has added urgency to developing new products.\n\nPrice wars with Amazon have been bruising, but Lynch was undismayed: \u201cWe\u2019re growing the digital content portion of the business, and that\u2019s where we envision making our economics,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nLast quarter, Barnes & Noble lost business when it didn\u2019t have enough Nook devices that allow for reading in the dark. Lynch said the company is now producing HD tablets in numbers sufficient to meet what it expects will be strong demand during the holiday period.\n\n\u201cWe believe we\u2019ll gain significant share in the tablet category, and we\u2019ve planned for that from a production standpoint. I believe these are going to be hot holiday gifts.\u201d"

        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has asked a federal judge to throw out Apple Inc\u2019s false advertising claim in a lawsuit challenging the online retailer\u2019s use of the \u201capp store\u201d name.\n\nThe claim is part of a March 2011 trademark lawsuit in which Apple, which this year became the world\u2019s largest company ever by market value, accused Amazon of misusing its \u201cApp Store\u201d name to solicit developers for a mobile software download service.\n\nApple added the trademark claim last November, soon after Amazon announced the launch of the Kindle Fire tablet and, according to the complaint, began to call its app store \u201cAmazon Appstore\u201d rather than \u201cAmazon Appstore for Android.\u201d It said this change could have contributed to confusion among consumers.\n\nBut in a filing on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Oakland, California, Amazon said the term \u201capp store\u201d has become so generic that its use could not constitute false advertising.\n\nAmazon added that even Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and his predecessor Steve Jobs have used the term to discuss rivals, with Cook having commented on \u201cthe number of app stores out there\u201d and Jobs referring to the \u201cfour app stores on Android.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple presumably does not contend that its past and current CEOs made false statements regarding to those other app stores to thousands of investors in earnings calls,\u201d Amazon said.\n\n\u201cTo the contrary, the use of the term \u2018app store\u2019 to refer to stores selling apps is commonplace in the industry.\u201d\n\nApple is based in Cupertino, California, and Amazon in Seattle. A hearing on Amazon\u2019s motion is scheduled for October 31, and a trial is scheduled for August 19, 2013.\n\nThe case is Apple Inc v. Amazon.com Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-01327."
