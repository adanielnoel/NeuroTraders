All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans when he speaks later in the day.\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network TV earlier on Monday, Evans said the Fed is on track to raise interest rates twice more this year.\n\nA host of Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week, including Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday.\n\nLast week, the central bank raised interest rates for the first time this year but stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of three expected by the market.\n\nAmong stocks, Movado fell 5.70 percent to $22.25 after the watchmaker\u2019s quarterly results missed expectations.\n\nWalt Disney rose 1.1 percent to $112.96 after the media and entertainment company\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d topped box-office sales. The stock was the second-biggest boost on the Dow.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,507 to 1,242. On the Nasdaq, 1,460 issues fell and 1,229 advanced.\n\nThe S&P 500 index showed 21 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 77 new highs and 20 new lows.
