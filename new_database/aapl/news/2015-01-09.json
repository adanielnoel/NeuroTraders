        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc won the dismissal on Thursday of a lawsuit accusing it of defrauding consumers by selling MacBook laptop computers that contained \u201clogic boards\u201d it knew were defective, and which routinely failed within two years.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said the plaintiffs, Uriel Marcus and Benedict Verceles, failed to show that Apple made \u201caffirmative misrepresentations,\u201d despite citing online complaints and Apple marketing statements calling the laptops \u201cstate of the art\u201d or the \u201cmost advanced\u201d on the market.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs have failed to allege that Apple\u2019s logic boards were unfit for their ordinary purposes or lacked a minimal level of quality,\u201d Alsup wrote. \u201cBoth plaintiffs were able to adequately use their computers for approximately 18 months and two years, respectively.\u201d\n\nAlsup gave the plaintiffs until Jan. 22 to amend their lawsuit, which sought class-action status, against the Cupertino, California-based company.\n\nOmar Rosales, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a similar request.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that Apple\u2019s sale of MacBooks since May 20, 2010, violated consumer protection laws in California and Texas, where the lawsuit began last May before being moved.\n\nThey also contended that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was told about the defective logic boards in 2011, but did nothing.\n\nLogic boards contain computer circuitry and are sometimes known as motherboards.\n\nA separate and still pending lawsuit in California accuses Apple of defrauding consumers by selling MacBook Pro laptops in 2011 that contained defective graphic cards, causing screen distortions and system failures.\n\nMacBooks are part of Apple\u2019s Mac line of desktop and laptop computers. The company reported unit sales in that business of 18.91 million in its latest fiscal year.\n\nThe case is Marcus et al v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-03824."
