        "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s antitrust chief dismissed on Friday accusations of anti-U.S. bias over her decision to go after Google (GOOGL.O) for abusing its Internet search dominance and Apple (AAPL.O) over an Irish tax deal, saying such talk was a fallacy.\n\nEuropean Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s robust defense of her actions came after she was criticized in the U.S. media for a spate of cases opened over the past year against U.S. giants such as Google, Apple, Amazon (AMZN.O) and Starbucks (SBUX.O).\n\nSome critics have accused EU regulators of seeking to protect European companies from U.S. competitors.\n\nVestager rejected the criticism, saying the nationality of companies played no role in her assessment.\n\n\u201cSome claim that our cases involving Internet giants such as Apple or Google are evidence of bias. Well, that is a fallacy,\u201d she said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the Foreign Policy Association in New York.\n\n\u201cYes, U.S. companies are often involved when we investigate the digital industry. But you will also see many Japanese firms in our car-part cartel cases,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said data on cartel fines and mergers also showed no geographic bias.\n\nThe European Commission is now studying Google\u2019s response to antitrust charges of favoring its Google Shopping service over rivals. It is also investigating the company\u2019s popular Android operating system for smartphones.\n\nAmazon is in the EU\u2019s crosshairs for a Luxembourg tax deal and Starbucks for a Dutch tax arrangement."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Many short sellers appear to have unwound their bets against Apple this week, and a 6 percent fall in the stock price suggests they made money as investor worries about the company countered a record launch of its newest iPhone.\n\nThe relentless ascent of Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) stock since it debuted its first smartphone in 2007 has made it unpopular for most short sellers.\n\nBut worries about slowing economic growth in China, an increasingly important market for Apple, have recently hurt the Cupertino, California company\u2019s shares, sending them down about 19 percent from a record high in April.\n\nOn Thursday, Apple was down 2.2 percent at $107.83 on a report that chip suppliers were concerned the iPhone maker would cut chip orders for the fourth quarter.\n\nThe stock fell 2 percent on Monday even after Apple announced record first-weekend sales of its new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus handsets, suggesting investors have concerns about whether Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook can top sales of previous devices.\n\nBorrowing in Apple shares grew 32 percent through most of September, and then abruptly dropped 31 percent this week, according to lending data from SunGard\u2019s Astec Analytics, which provides a strong glimpse into short-selling activity.\n\nShort sellers borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back later for less to return to the lender. During that time, they have to pay interest to the lender.\n\nThis week, Apple\u2019s stock has fallen almost 6 percent, suggesting short sellers wrapping up their bets may have made money.\n\nShort selling in Apple increased from 1.1 percent of its outstanding shares in July to 1.6 percent in mid-September, although that level of short selling remained below the average rate of 2.7 percent for tech companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nSince a selloff in Chinese equities in late August, Apple\u2019s stock has fallen about 7 percent, slightly less than the S&P 500\u2019s 9 percent decline.\n\nBrad Lamensdorf, who manages the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF, is currently short Apple shares. He suspects investors are overestimating iPhone sales in future quarters and he believes recent trading volume in Apple shares hints at more weakness to come.\n\nHe also likes shorting Apple because he doesn\u2019t have to compete with other short sellers to borrow the company\u2019s shares.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to get into highly crowded \u2018war shorts\u2019 that people have been in forever,\u201d he said. \u201cApple is the cheapest to borrow. There\u2019s plenty of supply and it\u2019s the lowest rate they\u2019ll charge you.\u201d"

The stock was the biggest drag on the three major indexes.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) index of national factory activity fell to 50.2 in September, its lowest since May 2013.\n\nNew jobless claims rose modestly last week but remained near 15-year lows. Also, a gauge of the trend in claims fell.\n\nMixed signals from the data could complicate the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to raise interest rates this year.\n\nWall Street rallied on Wednesday as investors bought beaten-down stocks, with biotechs rising for a second day after a recent bout of sustained selling.\n\n\u201cMarkets opened modestly lower after yesterday\u2019s big rally and then the ISM number came out just barely above 50,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\n\n\u201cStocks are recovering a little bit, but it goes on the side of the ledger that indicates that the U.S. and the global economies are certainly not growing at a robust rate.\u201d\n\nAll eyes will now be on the crucial non-farm payroll numbers due on Friday, for clues on the timing of a rate hike.\n\nInvestors will be keen to put the bruising quarter behind them and look ahead to the third-quarter earnings season, which begins next week.\n\nGlobal markets were upbeat after data from China was not as bad as feared. While factory activity in China shrank again in September, some investors said the government could be more aggressive in its measures to boost the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s sell-up was in a vacuum. There is still a sell bias and the unrest around Syria and Russia are also weighing,\u201d said Andrew Frankel, co-president of brokerage firm Stuart Frankel & Co in New York.\n\nGeneral Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler were up slightly after they reported a jump in September sales on Thursday.\n\nAt 11:09 a.m. ET (1509 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 95.64 points, or 0.59 percent, at 16,189.06, the S&P 500 was down 5.93 points, or 0.31 percent, at 1,914.1 and the Nasdaq composite was down 26.18 points, or 0.57 percent, at 4,593.98.\n\nEight of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower, with the utilities index\u2019s 1.33 percent fall leading the decliners.\n\nSan Francisco Fed Reserve President John Williams is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook at 2:30 p.m. in Utah.\n\nShares of Twitter were down 5.9 percent at $25.33, a day after on a report that co-founder and interim Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is expected to be named permanent CEO.\n\nDunkin Brands sank 10.3 percent to $43.96 after company gave weak full-year forecast and said it would shut 100 stores.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,459 to 1,450.
