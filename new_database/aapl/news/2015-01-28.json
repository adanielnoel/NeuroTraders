        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) quarterly results smashed Wall Street expectations with record sales of big-screen iPhones in the holiday shopping season and a 70 percent rise in China sales, powering the company to the largest profit in corporate history.\n\nThe company sold 74.5 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, while many analysts had expected fewer than 70 million. Revenue rose to $74.6 billion from $57.6 billion a year earlier.\n\nProfit of $18 billion was the biggest ever reported by a public company, worldwide, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Apple\u2019s cash pile is now $178 billion, enough to buy IBM (IBM.N) or the equivalent to $556 for every American.\n\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the Cupertino, California-based company would release its next product, the Apple Watch, in April.\n\nShares rose about 5 percent to $114.90 in after-hours trade.\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Apple-shareholder Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia, said that the report was a good sign in a quarter where big tech companies such as IBM and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have disappointed.\n\nApple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview that the company did not sell more iPhones in China than the United States, despite some earlier predictions by research analysts.\n\nBut the big-screen iPhone 6 and 6 plus drove revenues in China were up 70 percent in the quarter from a year earlier. The company\u2019s success in the competitive Chinese market can be attributed to its partnership with China Mobile Ltd (0941.HK), the largest global mobile carrier, and the appeal of the larger screen size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\nMaestri said he does not expect Apple to struggle because of China\u2019s slipping economic growth. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a slowdown,\u201d he added.\n\nMaestri also said the company doubled iPhone sales in Singapore and Brazil.\n\nApple will reach 40 company stores in greater China by mid-2016, Maestri told analysts on a conference call.\n\nCarolina Milanesi, an analyst with Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, also lauded a 14 percent rise in unit sales of Apple Macintosh computers and sales of older iPhone models.\n\nApple was well positioned for the current quarter in China, she added, which will include the Chinese New Year holiday and reflect Apple\u2019s attempts to sell through new channels.\n\nApple reported net profit of $18.02 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share, compared with $13.07 billion, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier. That topped expectations of $2.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts had expected revenue of $67.69 billion.\n\nMaestri said that Apple faced \u201ca clear headwind\u201d from the strong dollar but that it had included the challenge in its forecasts. Apple predicted revenue of $52 billion to $55 billion in its fiscal second quarter, compared with Wall Street\u2019s average target of $53.79 billion.\n\nCook said that the company\u2019s new mobile payment service, Apple Pay, which lets customer buy products from select merchants with their phones, was in its \u201cfirst inning\u201d and the company would consider adding new features as it looked at expanding outside the United States."

        "body": "SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn Technology Group, the world\u2019s largest contract electronics manufacturer, will cut its massive workforce, the company told Reuters, as the Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier faces declining revenue growth and rising wages in China.\n\nUnder its flagship unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), the group currently employs about 1.3 million people during peak production times, making it one of the largest private employers in the world.\n\nSpecial assistant to the chairman and group spokesman Louis Woo did not specify a timeframe or target for the reduction, but noted that labor costs had more than doubled since 2010, when the company faced intense media scrutiny following a spate of worker suicides.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically stabilized (our workforce) in the last three years,\u201d Woo said. When asked if the company plans to reduce overall headcount, he responded \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nRevenue growth at the conglomerate tumbled to 1.3 percent in 2013 and only partially recovered to 6.5 percent last year after a long string of double-digit increases from 2003 to 2012.\n\nThat decade saw the firm ride an explosion of popularity in PCs, smartphones and tablets, largely driven by its main client Apple, but now it is feeling the effects of falling growth and prices in the gadget markets it supplies, a trend that is expected to continue.\n\nGrowth in smartphone sales will halve this year from 26 percent in 2014, according to researcher IDC, while PC sales will contract by 3 percent.\n\nSimilarly, the average smartphone will sell for 19 percent less in 2018 than last year\u2019s $297.\n\n\u201cEven if technology is improving, the price will still come down,\u201d Woo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to accept that, our customers have come to accept that.\u201d\n\nAutomation will be key to keeping labor costs under control in the long-term, Woo said, as the company pushes to have robotic arms complete mundane tasks currently done by workers.\n\nBut Woo noted that company chairman Terry Gou\u2019s previously stated goal of 1 million robots was \u201ca generic concept\u201d rather than a firm target."
