        "body": "CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook summed up the problem during a conversation with sales staff at a London Apple Store: \u201cWe\u2019ve never sold anything as a company that people could try on before.\u201d\n\nWith the expected launch next month of the Apple Watch, the company\u2019s first new product in five years, Apple will be stepping into new territory.\n\nTo conquer the marketplace, the watch will have to appeal not only as a gadget but as a fashion statement, a fact tacitly acknowledged by Apple\u2019s decision to launch its advertising campaign with a 12-page insert in the March issue of Vogue.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t talking about plans for marketing the Apple Watch in advance of its much-touted \u201cSpring Forward\u201d event on Monday, but it clearly intends to keep a tight grip on initial sales and distribution, leaving many retailers guessing about when - or if - they\u2019ll be able to sell it.\n\nSources with direct knowledge of the matter said that Best Buy Co Inc, one of the largest sellers of Apple products, may not get the watch at launch time, though the company wouldn\u2019t comment on the situation.\n\nOther large retailers, including Macy\u2018s, Saks 5th Avenue, Bloomingdales and Barneys said they had no immediate plans to carry the watch. Target and Nordstrom, along with all the major phone carriers, declined to comment on their plans, though a source with knowledge of the situation said Nordstrom has engaged in discussions with Apple.\n\n\u201cApple is being cautious. There are too many unknowns around how this product will perform,\u201d said Van Baker, research vice-president, technology research firm Gartner Inc.\n\nThat might mean restricting initial sales to company stores, where Apple has complete control over the experience and staff can be specially trained to sell the watch, Baker said.\n\nApple\u2019s Cook seems very aware of the challenge. The Telegraph, which sent a reporter with the CEO to the company\u2019s Covent Garden store, reported that he explained to the staff that selling the watch might require \u201ctweaking the experience in the store.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of hard information about what the tweaks might look like, speculation has been intense. The Washington Post last week suggested that Apple might add carpeting and mirrors and change store lighting to enhance the watch-buying experience.\n\nMedia outlets and websites have also posited that the watch will be offered at special pop-up stores installed at luxury retailers such as Selfridges in London and Colette in Paris.\n\nApple hosted a private event at Colette last September, at which guests were able to try on the watch, but a spokesman for Colette declined to comment on whether the store would carry it.\n\nUntil now, wearable gadgets have not been big sellers for technology companies. Rival products such as Samsung\u2019s Gear watches have sold poorly.\n\nApple hopes to change that, but it is still a big if whether the watch will appeal to buyers seeking a fashion accessory, especially if it needs to be upgraded every few years like Apple\u2019s phones, tablets and computers.\n\n\u201cIt could do wonders for the watch market if it means people might wear watches again, but realistically, there are a lot of doubts,\u201d said Eric Wilson, fashion news director of InStyle.\n\n\u201cFashion customers are more skeptical than anyone, so Apple has picked a tough crowd.\u201d"

        "body": "(Reuters) - HBO\u2019s standalone streaming service will launch on Apple Inc devices next month in time for the season premiere of hit series \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the network said on Monday, a move to reach millions of viewers who do not subscribe to pay television packages.\n\nThe new HBO Now service will cost $14.99 a month. It will include the network\u2019s past, present and future series plus its lineup of Hollywood movies, HBO Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler said at an Apple event in San Francisco.\n\nIt is the first time the premium network will be available to people with Internet access who shun traditional TV bundles with dozens of channels. Other media companies including CBS Corp and Dish Network Corp also are taking steps to reach those audiences.\n\n\u201cThis is a transformative moment for HBO,\u201d Plepler said after an introduction by Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nThe move by Time Warner Inc\u2019s HBO could threaten the video businesses of cable and satellite companies, which are fighting to keep customers from dropping their TV packages. It also amps up competition with streaming services such as Netflix Inc. HBO\u2019s library of hits includes \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cSex and the City.\u201d\n\nStarting in early April, HBO Now will be available through the Apple TV box and on iPhones, iPads and the iPod touch. The fifth season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premieres April 12.\n\nApple will be the exclusive digital provider of HBO Now for three months. The network also is aiming to convince traditional TV distributors to offer the service as early as April.\n\nPlepler, in an interview, said HBO Now offers pay TV distributors the chance to package it with broadband-only or smaller TV bundles and improve retention. The distributors also would get a share of the monthly revenue.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an enhancement and a turbocharge to their own business,\u201d he said.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and Dish had no comment. Other distributors could not immediately be reached.\n\nHBO Now is separate from the HBO Go streaming service for customers who subscribe through TV packages.\n\nApple also said it was cutting the Apple TV\u2019s price to $69 from $99.Time Warner shares rose 1.3 percent to $85.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Netflix fell 1.9 percent to $445.63, while Apple shares climbed 0.4 percent to $127.14. Both trade on Nasdaq."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook on Monday is expected to announce details of the first product developed under his leadership, a watch that Apple hopes will transform the market of wearable technology.\n\nThe company provided a sneak preview of the \u201cApple Watch\u201d in September, has shown it to fashionistas, and even bought a 12-page advertising spread in Vogue magazine, but fans and skeptics are eager for more details.\n\nWith a rectangular face of about 1.5 inches (38 mm) in the smaller of two sizes, the watch wirelessly tethers to an iPhone, measures heart rate, and can tap wearers on the wrist to signal a new message or appointment. The price will start at $349.\n\nApple has said the watch will launch in April and speculation is rife on what capabilities, from healthcare and fitness to navigation and entertainment, will be included. Apple fans have been waiting for a new type of product for five years, raising expectations.\n\nIt is an open question whether Apple or anyone else can create a new market for watches. The first watches based on Google Inc\u2019s Android Wear software became available last year.\n\nCompanies, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, LG Electronics Inc, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Qualcomm Inc, collectively have not yet had a wearable hit. More companies are expected to test the waters this year, including possibly Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd, China\u2019s largest maker of smartphones.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional watch brands such as Swatch are beginning to make timepieces with features such as activity tracking.\n\nRoughly 4.6 million smartwatches were shipped in 2014, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Analysts estimate that Apple could sell anywhere from 10 million to 32 million Apple Watches in 2015. By comparison, Apple sold about 15 million iPads in 2010, after an April launch.\n\nApple will have to \u201ctweak\u201d its stores to handle the watch, Cook told the Telegraph newspaper recently.\n\nCook is expected to take stage at 10 a.m. PST (1 p.m. EST) on Monday in a carefully choreographed presentation. The company has not confirmed the event is about the Watch, but the invitation simply reads \u201cSpring Forward,\u201d a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight savings, which begins the day before."
