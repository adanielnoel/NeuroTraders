        "body": "TomTom Updates Its Navigation App for iPhone and iPad\n\n~ Introducing new ways to find new places ~\n\nTomTom launches a new version (v1.11) of its Navigation app for iPhone and iPad. Customers with an older version of the app can download it for free. They\u2019ll then be able to navigate to addresses found on the internet, search with foursquare\u2122*, and get the very latest TomTom maps.\n\nDrivers can now quickly and easily navigate to places they\u2019ve found on websites and other apps by copying an address and pasting it into their TomTom Navigation app. There\u2019s no need to type as the app will automatically work out the destination and direct them straight there.\n\nWhile v1.10 integrated Facebook Places with the app, v1.11 adds foursquare. After linking foursquare to the TomTom app, users can search and navigate to their favorite foursquare places, checking in to collect points on arrival.\n\n\u201cDrivers now have new ways to find places with their TomTom app,\u201d says Corinne Vigreux, Managing Director Consumer at TomTom. \u201cThis should be particularly helpful when people are off on holidays and day trips. They can find great places to visit and get there fast with foursquare or a quick copy-paste. And that leaves more time to relax and have fun.\u201d\n\nBeyond the new search facilities, v1.11 brings other improvements to TomTom Navigation for iPhone. Changes have also been made to the user interface to make the app even more intuitive to use.\n\nThe latest version of the TomTom Navigation app for iPhone and iPad is available as a free download to customers with an earlier version of the app.\n\nFor new customers, the app can be purchased for $49.99 at the Apple App Store.\n\n*Foursquare, is a location-based social networking website for mobile devices, such as smartphones. Users \"check in\" at venues using a mobile website, text messaging or a device-specific application by selecting from a list of venues the application locates nearby.\n\nFounded in 1991, TomTom (AEX:TOM2) is the world\u2019s leading supplier of in-car location and navigation products and services focused on providing all drivers with the world\u2019s best navigation experience.

        "body": "The Silicon Valley makers of iPhone application Ness have received a five-star review from investors. The company closed a $15 million round led by SingTel Innov8, the venture arm of Singapore Telecommunications.\n\nFounded in 2009, Ness Computing intends to help people discover places. The startup released Ness for iPhone one year ago, and the application pivots around a \u201clikeness\u201d score that predicts how much a customer will like a restaurant, using a 0 to 100 percent scoring system. Users leave bite-sized reviews in the form of one to five-star ratings, and Ness combines those ratings with social data from Foursquare and Facebook to perfect its score.\n\nNess ultimately wants to tell you more than where to just grab a bite or pick up a cup of coffee; it wants to show you what to do, see, and buy. American Express, existing investors Khosla Ventures and Alsop Louie Partners, and an affiliate of the LeFrak Organization participated in the startup\u2019s latest round, which Ness will use to develop into more of a personal shopping tool for mobile.\n\nThe three-year-old company, which competes with Yelp and Foursquare, has the multimillion-dollar confidence of investors because the algorithms used in Ness\u2019s search and recommendations engines can be applied to areas such as bars, nightlife, travel, movies, music, shopping, and beyond, Ness cofounder Corey Reese said.\n\n\u201cThe risk area that we\u2019ve mitigated \u2026 was that core technology development,\u201d Reese said, comparing the sophistication of his company\u2019s search technologies to those employed by Google, Amazon, and Apple.\n\nBut a startup that\u2019s hesitant to share the size of its active user base, as is this case with Ness, is not one that typically instills confidence in its health (at least for this reporter). Reese insisted, however, that Ness intentionally chose not to focus on user growth and opted instead to improve the technology powering the application.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using this next round of financing to focus on growing the user base and getting out into these additional categories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time improving our recommendation technology, developing our own new algorithms \u2026 and we\u2019ve been generating a tremendous amount of data from our users.\u201d\n\nOn the data front, Ness users have contributed more than 3 million ratings to the system since the iPhone application\u2019s release last August. On average, people generate 17 ratings the first time they start using Ness, Reese said.\n\nIn addition to going after users, Ness will apply its fresh $15 million in financing to move into the new verticals mentioned above, piece together even more signals from channels such as Twitter and credit card transactions to perfect the scoring algorithm, and continue to focus on product craftsmanship, Reese said. The startup also hopes to release an application for Android by early next year.\n\nNess Computing has raised $20 million in total funding to date."
