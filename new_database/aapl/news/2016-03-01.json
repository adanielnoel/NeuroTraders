        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the House Judiciary Committee are considering filing a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief in Apple Inc\u2019s [AAPL.O] encryption dispute with the U.S. government to argue that the case should be decided by Congress and not the courts, five sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe sources cautioned that no final agreement had been reached on what would be an unusual intervention by congressmen in a legal proceeding. Any filing would occur after a panel hearing on Tuesday that will include FBI Director James Comey and Apple General Counsel Bruce Sewell. The court deadline is Thursday.\n\nThe filing would argue that the Feb. 16 order from a federal court in California that instructs Apple to write special software to unlock an iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino shooters threatens the constitutional separation of powers, the sources said.\n\nThey said the brief would come from individual committee members of both Republican and Democratic parties but not the judiciary committee itself. Reuters could not determine which members were likely to be included.\n\nLawmakers could wait until the appeals process before intervening, the sources said.\n\nApple last week formally opposed the order in court, calling the case \u201cunprecedented\u201d and a violation of free speech rights that would override the will of Congress.\n\nOn Monday, a judge in a related New York case sided with Apple in agreeing that the courts did not have the authority to order Apple to unlock a phone.\n\nThe San Bernardino case has come to represent a broader debate over how much authority law enforcement should have to compel companies to assist in monitoring digital communications.\n\nThe encryption debate does not divide along party lines, with liberal Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans both supporting Apple\u2019s stance. Many pro-law enforcement lawmakers of both parties, and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, support the government\u2019s position.\n\nThe unusual Congressional intervention would come on top of a wave of support for Apple among its Silicon Valley brethren. Some two-dozen companies and civil liberties groups are expected to weigh in on Apple\u2019s side. Relatives of some of the shooting victims are planning to back the government\u2019s case, said their lawyer, Stephen Larson.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier this month sought and obtained a court order requiring that Apple write new software and take other steps to unlock an iPhone 5C that was used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife went on a shooting rampage on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino that killed 14 and wounded 22.\n\nThe government has said the attack was inspired by Islamist militants and the FBI wants to read data from the phone to investigate any links the couple might have had with militant groups. Apple is concerned that the order would lead to endless similar requests in the U.S. and overseas and ultimately undermine the security of all Apple phone.\n\nA number of large tech firms have publicly said they will file briefs supporting Apple. Google, Facebook and Microsoft are expected to file jointly and be represented by Neal Katyal, a Georgetown law professor and former acting U.S. solicitor general for the Obama administration, according to a source familiar with the companies\u2019 plans.\n\nAmazon, LinkedIn, Twitter, the Mozilla Foundation, and the cloud storage firm Box, along with advocacy groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology, are also expected to support Apple.\n\nStill, some major companies, including IBM, are expected to sit out the fight. Telecom carriers have also been notably reluctant to get involved; Verizon is unlikely to file a friend of the court brief, despite comments from its CEO that the company supports encryption with no backdoors, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment on Sunday about what other briefs were expected.\n\nApple\u2019s high-profile standoff with the U.S. government is being played out as many of the Obama administration\u2019s most senior officials are traveling to San Francisco this week to attend the world\u2019s largest cyber security conference.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, National Security Director Michael Rogers and Defense Secretary Ash Carter are all scheduled to speak at RSA conference, where the iPhone fight and encryption more broadly are expected to dominate conversation."

        "body": "(Reuters) - The U.S. government cannot force Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to unlock an iPhone in a New York drug case, a federal judge in Brooklyn said on Monday, a ruling that bolsters the company\u2019s arguments in its landmark legal showdown with the Justice Department over encryption and privacy.\n\nThe government sought access to the phone in the Brooklyn case in October, months before a judge in California ordered Apple to take special measures to give the government access to the phone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, California, attacks.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in Brooklyn ruled that he did not have the legal authority to order Apple to disable the security of an iPhone that was seized during a drug investigation.\n\nHis ruling echoed many of the arguments that Apple has made in the San Bernardino case, particularly his finding that a 1789 law called the All Writs Act cannot be used to force Apple to open the phone. Orenstein also found that Apple was largely exempt from complying with such requests by a 1994 law that updated wiretapping laws.\n\nA senior Apple executive, who spoke on condition he not be named, said during a call with reporters that Orenstein\u2019s decision would bode well for the company in the San Bernardino case, which has touched off a fierce national debate about the balance between fighting crime and preserving privacy in the digital age.\n\nHe said that the government\u2019s demands in the San Bernardino case, which include compelling Apple to alter its operating system, were even more far-reaching than in the NY case.\n\nAlthough U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, the judge in the San Bernardino case, will not be bound by Orenstein\u2019s decision, the senior Apple executive said it will likely be influential. In both cases, the government relies on the All Writs Act, a broad 1789 law which enables judges to require actions necessary to enforce their own orders.\n\nThe Justice Department is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Orenstein\u2019s ruling and plans to ask a higher judge within the same federal district to review the matter in coming days, a department representative said.\n\nThough the defendant in the drug case has already pleaded guilty, the Justice Department still believes the phone may contain evidence that \u201cwill assist us in an active criminal investigation,\u201d the official said.\n\nWhen fighting the government\u2019s order to help extract data from the iPhone, Apple had argued that being forced to do so \u201ccould threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,\u201d according to court records.\n\nOrenstein said his ruling in Apple\u2019s favor was not a decision on \u201cwhether the government should be able to force Apple to help it unlock a specific device; it is instead whether the All Writs Act (AWA) resolves that issue and many others like it yet to come.\u201d\n\nOrenstein concluded that \u201cthe government posits a reading of the latter phrase so expansive \u2013 and in particular, in such tension with the doctrine of separation of powers \u2013 as to cast doubt on the AWA\u2019s constitutionality if adopted.\u201d\n\nHe also wrote: \u201cThe implications of the government\u2019s position are so far-reaching \u2013 both in terms of what it would allow today and what it implies about Congressional intent in 1789 \u2013 as to produce impermissibly absurd results.\u201d\n\nOrenstein also found that Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, passed in 1994, exempted Apple from this sort of request.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have voiced support for Apple.\n\nThe iPhone 5s at issue in the case was seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration during a 2014 search of the Queens, New York, residence of Jun Feng, who authorities suspected of being involved in drug trafficking.\n\nAuthorities sought to access the phone in 2015 while the case was pending. Feng later pleaded guilty in October while Orenstein was weighing the request, but both Apple and the Justice Department said they still wanted a ruling.\n\nProsecutors have said that since 2008, Apple has complied with 70 such court orders based on the All Writs Act without objection. Many of those cases appear to have involved earlier iPhone models that did not require customized software to unlock.\n\nThe case before Brooklyn was, according to prosecutors, the first time Apple had objected to law enforcement efforts to utilize search warrants to get the tech company to provide assistance and unlock iPhones seized during investigations.\n\nBut since October, when Apple first asked Orenstein to deny the government\u2019s request, Apple has objected to helping law enforcement access at least 12 devices for which the U.S. Justice Department has sought its help, according to a letter from Apple to Orenstein that was unsealed earlier this month.\n\nThe senior Apple executive said the company has never made a new piece of software in response to a government request."
