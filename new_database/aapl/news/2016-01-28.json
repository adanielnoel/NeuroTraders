        "body": "HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s smartphone boom may be over, as even Apple Inc grapples with a slowing economy and investor darling Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL] struggles to stand out amid intense competition in low-margin handsets.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple reported the slowest-ever increase in iPhone shipments as the Chinese market weakened. That slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy is threatening to hamstring consumption across the country.\n\nXiaomi, China\u2019s most valuable start-up with a $45 billion pricetag, is under threat, after it missed targets for $1 billion in Internet service revenue and also handsets sales in 2015.\n\nAs China\u2019s economy grows at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century, the country\u2019s once booming smartphone market has become saturated. For vendors whose products have become commoditised and make little to no profit, that doesn\u2019t just mean the years of easy growth are in the past, but that it could be a struggle to keep their heads above water.\n\n\u201cThe large growth rates that we saw in years past are definitely much different now,\u201d said Bryan Ma, analyst at IDC, which predicted China\u2019s smartphone market will grow at 1-2 percent this year. \u201cIn theory it could slip below zero this year, but either way, it\u2019s relatively flat.\u201d\n\nLast year, IDC estimated it grew 2 percent. From 2011 to 2013, the market on average more than doubled in size each year.\n\nXiaomi\u2019s Internet services revenue surged 150 percent to 3.71 billion yuan ($563.94 million) from 1.48 billion yuan a year earlier, an internal document reviewed by Reuters showed.\n\nA spokeswoman for Xiaomi declined to comment on revenue for 2015.\n\nLike peers such as Apple, Beijing-based Xiaomi is trying to sidestep a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest handset market by coaxing smartphone buyers to also purchase Internet services and opening stores in China\u2019s less wealthy cities.\n\nThe firm has grown rapidly since it started in 2010. But Xiaomi\u2019s valuation has been questioned recently as the firm has struggled to maintain its early growth surge.\n\nXiaomi missed its global shipment target by 12 percent, selling 70 million handsets last year, when domestic rivals such as Lenovo Group Ltd and top player Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] countered at home with similar Internet-only device sales campaigns.\n\n\u201cGiven that Xiaomi\u2019s valuation has always been based on the company being more than a commodity handset manufacturer, missing their services revenue goal by such a significant margin is even more concerning than missing their handset target,\u201d said Ben Thompson, a tech analyst at Stratechery.\n\nNow it\u2019s a question of whether Xiaomi can grow that revenue fast enough to prove its critics wrong, Thompson said.\n\nThe company encapsulates the risks of a vendor like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in recent years, who can\u2019t build a moat for their business.\n\n\u201cThe only way to win with an undifferentiated product is having a superior cost structure and scale,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cSamsung did it, and now Huawei is doing it. \u2018Win\u2019 is all relative though, if you\u2019re making a couple of bucks in profit per phone.\u201d"

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/MUMBAI (Reuters) - As China sales show signs of cooling, Apple Inc(AAPL.O) is touting India\u2019s appetite for iPhones, betting that rising wages and an expanding middle class will pull consumers away from the cheap alternatives that currently dominate the market.\n\nIn an earnings call in which the company reported meagre iPhone growth and forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years, the Indian market stood out as a rare bright spot for Apple.\n\nSales of the company\u2019s flagship smartphone climbed 76 percent in India from the year-ago quarter, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Counterpoint Technology Research, Apple sold an estimated 800,000 iPhones in India in the fourth-quarter, its highest ever amount but one that is a fraction of the 28 million smartphones sold during that period.\n\nGrowth in India is a tantalizing prospect as Apple grapples with the economic downturn in China, its second largest market. While revenue in Greater China rose 14 percent in the last quarter, Apple is beginning to see a shift in the economy, particularly in Hong Kong, Maestri told Reuters in an interview.\n\nBut with nearly 70 percent of smartphones selling for less than $150 in India, Apple\u2019s high-end phones remain out of reach of most consumers. The basic iPhone 6S sells at just under $700 in India, or nearly half the average annual wage.\n\n\u201cIn many ways India is very similar to what China was a few years ago, but the middle class here is still very small and it can be two to three years before Apple gets a similar level of success in India,\u201d said Counterpoint Technology Research analyst Tarun Pathak.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook struck a more optimistic note, saying the company was \u201cincreasingly putting more energy\u201d into India, citing a largely youthful population with rising disposable income as more people join the workforce.\n\nWith faster 4G coverage expanding, Apple has already asked Indian government for a license to set up its own retail stores just as the market seems to be turning in its favour.\n\nAs in China, Apple products are a coveted status symbol in India, a market that analysts say is likely to overtake the United States next year to become the world\u2019s second largest smartphone market.\n\n\u201cThe love for the iPhone is there,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of U.S. business at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, a consumer research firm."

Unit sales typically drop over the next few quarters leading up to the next iPhone launch.\n\nThe iPhone 7 is expected to sport a new look with features such as waterproofing, wireless headphones and force touch as home button.\n\nUp to Tuesday\u2019s close, Apple\u2019s stock had lost a quarter of its value since April 28, when it hit a record high of $134.54.
