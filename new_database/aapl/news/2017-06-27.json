        "body": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday invited the acting solicitor general to weigh in on the $120 million patent-infringement litigation between Apple and Samsung Electronics, a move that generally indicates that the justices are interested in the case.\n\nSamsung asked the high court to review last October\u2019s decision by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In that ruling, the Circuit reinstated jury findings that several of Samsung\u2019s mobile devices made before 2013 had copied Apple\u2019s autocorrect, slide-to-unlock, and \u201cquick links\u201d feature, which automatically turns information such as addresses and phone numbers into links.\n\nTo read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2tfHVFj"
