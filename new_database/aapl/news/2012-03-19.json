        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc said it plans to pay a quarterly dividend of $2.65 per share and authorized a $10 billion stock buyback program to be carried out over three years.\n\nThe moves, plus money spent to settle vesting restricted stock units, will use about $45 billion of Apple\u2019s nearly $100 billion in cash and securities, the company said on Monday. Apple\u2019s shares rose 2 percent in premarket.\n\nThe iPad, iPhone, iPod and Mac personal computer maker plans to initiate the quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which begins on July 1, and to begin the stock repurchase program in fiscal 2013, which starts on September 30.\n\nPETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT KNIGHT CAPITAL IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY\n\n\u201dThat will be very supportive of not just Apple, which the market has been anticipating, but the supply chain - the legendary Apple supply chain. As a result, you are going to see tech - not just large cap, but smaller cap tech also participate in the move.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s a good story, the market was kind of expecting that - people were questioning what Apple could do with the money other than earn nothing.\n\n\u201dThis is certainly a theme that has been widely been used by large cap tech to support not only pricing but also to support earnings, because in some respects putting your money back into the company, effectively taking shares out of the market by corporate repurchase has a very direct and very positive impact on pricing.\n\n\u201cThat is very, very good for the stock, it\u2019s very good for the market, it\u2019s great for the sector and it\u2019s very, very good for the supply chain.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis is consistent with what we, and I think most, expected them to do, which is to address shareholder concerns around the huge cash stockpile while retaining enough of a reserve to keep a wide range of strategic options on the table.\n\n\u201cThis, plus the buyback should continue to bolster the soaring share price.\u201d\n\nJOHN STRAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF STRAND CONSULT IN COPENHAGEN \u201cApple is an overcapitalized company and it\u2019s probably better to have the cash in the shareholders\u2019 pockets then in Apple\u2019s pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is $45 billion in three years out of $100 billion now. It\u2019s a small percentage of the pile.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people who own this stock some dividend is better than no dividend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stock has run on things that are not really major surprises. It\u2019s not irrational there\u2019s some pullback.\u201d\n\nWILLIAM LEFKOWITZ, CHIEF OPTIONS STRATEGIST AT VFINANCE INVESTMENTS IN NEW YORK\n\n\u201dI would say it was definitely expected, a lot of mutual funds that say they\u2019re buying dividend companies had Apple in them - that shouldn\u2019t be but I guess it was that obvious that after Tim Cook spoke last time that this was the case.\n\n\u201dEven though it\u2019s a nice dividend - and buying back shares - sometimes companies or individual investors will just sell on the news. I think it\u2019s good news and that\u2019s what people wanted. There are investors who would not buy it until it paid a dividend so it opens a brand new door for them.\n\n\u201dThe weekly options - on Friday it was just wild what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t know what they could have said over the weekend to kill the company but on Friday you could have - the (weekly) $540s for almost $2. In five days it had to go down $45 for the guys to buy that.\n\n\u201cLast Thursday it was up $20, once it goes up $15-$20 then a volatility index becomes a lot richer. There are a couple of reasons why volatility should continue: they make everything they do like a major event and Apple also does a lot of that themselves. They could have just said in this morning we\u2019re going to do a dividend, but no, they\u2019re doing a conference call too, so they know how to excite Wall Street too.\u201d\n\n\u201dWhile the size of Apple\u2019s dividend may be less than anticipated by some analysts, we are encouraged by management and the board\u2019s conservative position. We are in favor of starting with a dividend that we anticipate growing over time.\n\n\u201dWe like that the dividend and stock buybacks can be done using the U.S. cash balance which would not raise the company\u2019s tax rate.\n\n\u201cThe $10 billion dividend payout in its first year will make Apple one of the largest dividend payers.\u201d"

        "body": "NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple is finally giving its shareholders a bite of its cash pile. The company will hand out about $45 billion over three years, including some $30 billion of dividends and $10 billion of buybacks. While that\u2019s a good start, Apple could make $50 billion in free cash flow in the fiscal year ending in September. With sales and profit rocketing -- and the bulk of its huge cash hoard still stuck overseas -- bigger payouts will surely follow.\n\nApple had $98 billion of cash and investments on its books at the end of December. Close to two-thirds is held overseas, and repatriating it to the United States would involve a big tax hit. So Apple is keen to avoid tapping this, preferring to let it grow while it awaits a possible tax holiday.\n\nThat still leaves $34 billion in the United States. Even this domestic stash probably won\u2019t be touched, despite the new payouts. Apple tends to avoid big acquisitions, and the company has been disciplined with its investments in research, development and the like. And the dividend is set to start only in the three months ending in September, by which time another few quarters of cash will be in the bank.\n\nAssume Apple does make $50 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year, and that a third of that is in the United States. That\u2019s more than enough ongoing cash flow to cover $15 billion a year of dividends and buybacks. Moreover, Apple\u2019s revenue and profit are growing. The company\u2019s top line increased 73 percent in the last quarter of 2011 from a year earlier, and earnings more than doubled.\n\nGrowth isn\u2019t going to grind to a halt, either. The company\u2019s new iPad went on sale last week and Tim Cook, the chief executive, said on Monday\u2019s call that the result was a record weekend. Other new or refreshed products are expected in the fall.\n\nAll that means the near-$100 billion cash pile is still going to grow, not shrink. Not surprisingly, shareholders welcomed Apple\u2019s payout announcement, pushing the company\u2019s market value up by approaching $10 billion. But as the money rolls in, they may soon start asking the big question again: What is Apple really going to do with its cash?\n\n-- Apple on March 19 said it had authorized the repurchase of $10 billion of its stock over three years and plans to commence a quarterly dividend of $2.65 a share in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2012, which begins on July 1.\n\n-- Between dividends, share repurchases and cash used to settle vesting restricted stock, the company said it would use about $45 billion of cash in the first three years of the payouts.\n\n-- Apple had $98 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet on December 31, $64 billion of it held outside the United States.\n\n-- For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on"

Close to two-thirds is held overseas, and repatriating it to the United States would involve a big tax hit. So Apple is keen to avoid tapping this, preferring to let it grow while it awaits a possible tax holiday.\n\nThat still leaves $34 billion in the United States. Even this domestic stash probably won\u2019t be touched, despite the new payouts. Apple tends to avoid big acquisitions, and the company has been disciplined with its investments in research, development and the like. And the dividend is set to start only in the three months ending in September, by which time another few quarters of cash will be in the bank.\n\nAssume Apple does make $50 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year, and that a third of that is in the United States. That\u2019s more than enough ongoing cash flow to cover $15 billion a year of dividends and buybacks. Moreover, Apple\u2019s revenue and profit are growing. The company\u2019s top line increased 73 percent in the last quarter of 2011 from a year earlier, and earnings more than doubled.\n\nGrowth isn\u2019t going to grind to a halt, either. The company\u2019s new iPad went on sale last week and Tim Cook, the chief executive, said on Monday\u2019s call that the result was a record weekend. Other new or refreshed products are expected in the fall.\n\nAll that means the near-$100 billion cash pile is still going to grow, not shrink. Not surprisingly, shareholders welcomed Apple\u2019s payout announcement, pushing the company\u2019s market value up by approaching $10 billion. But as the money rolls in, they may soon start asking the big question again: What is Apple really going to do with its cash?"

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple isn\u2019t the only prominent company that analysts have tagged as a potential source of dividend payouts. Investors can target the sweet spot of reliable income and share price gains by buying companies that are likely to initiate or increase dividends.\n\nWith nearly $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Apple will initiate a dividend and share buyback that will total $45 billion over three years.\n\nA quarterly dividend of $2.65 per share will begin in July, marking Apple\u2018s\u2019s first such payout since 1995.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that many institutional investors have been expecting. Apple increased its earnings per share by 83 percent in 2011, but its shares traded at price-to-earnings multiples more in line with industries like railroads or grocery stores than innovative technology businesses.\n\nApple\u2019s huge cash pile was one reason for its low P-E, because investors were acting as if shareholders would never see the benefit of that cash.\n\nHere, then, are suggestions on how to build a dividend strategy with Apple in mind:\n\nAnalysts expect Apple\u2019s large technology peers to follow the leader and boost their dividend payouts.\n\n\u201cIf anybody can make dividends cool, it\u2019s Apple,\u201d said Christopher Davis, a fund analyst at Morningstar who covers dividend funds.\n\nWith higher-than-average cash levels on their balance sheets and strong brand names, many tech companies look more like classic value companies than the go-go growth stocks of the late 1990s. Those cheap valuations may help these giant tech companies sustain share gains even if the market rally fizzles.\n\nMicrosoft pays a dividend with a yield of 2.4 percent, while Cisco Systems pays a dividend yield of 1.6 percent. Higher dividends would make these large-cap technology companies even more attractive to fund managers and other institutional investors, analysts say.\n\nAnd more dividend initiations could be coming out of Silicon Valley. With Apple set to pay a dividend with a yield of 1.8 percent, Google now becomes one of the largest tech companies that does not offer a payout. The company has some $45 billion in cash and is trading at a price-to-book value of 3.5, well below Apple\u2019s 7.1 price-to-book value.\n\n\u201cDigesting the pending acquisition of Motorola Mobility will keep them occupied for now, but longer term Google\u2019s core business is a strong cash generator, and a dividend would be one way to put that cash to work,\u201d said Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research in New York.\n\nA technology-focused ETF could be another way to play possible dividend increases in the sector. The $9.5 billion Technology Select SPDR, for example, is top heavy with dividend payers Apple, Microsoft, International Business Machines and AT&T accounting for 41 percent of the fund\u2019s assets. Google is the fifth-largest holding at 5.3 percent.\n\nThe fund, which costs 18 cents per $100 invested, yields 1.33 percent.\n\nThe volatility in the stock market last year made dividend strategies increasingly popular. Dividend-focused funds and ETFs collectively had $17.3 billion in inflows last year, despite a broader investor push away from equity funds, according to Morningstar data.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend that shows few signs of letting up, despite a new risk: the end of low tax rates on dividends. Dividend income tax rules are set to revert to the pre-George W. Bush era, which means dividends will be taxed at ordinary income rates of up to 39.6 percent. The tax is currently 15 percent.\n\nInvestors who focus on dividends argue that they are a sign of a strong balance sheet and a proven business model. Classic dividend payers like Johnson & Johnson and Exxon Mobil tend to hold their value during volatile markets because of the payouts, said Linda Duessel, a senior equity strategist at Federated Investors specializing in equity income.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many blue chip companies pay higher dividends than 10-year Treasuries, which currently yield about 2.4 percent. While these stocks come with more risks than U.S. bonds, their large cash positions are attractive to income-seeking investors.\n\nThe $9.6 billion Vanguard Dividend Growth fund is one way to target companies upping their shareholder payouts. It yields 1.9 percent and costs 34 cents per $100 invested. Automatic Data Processing, Occidental Petroleum and PepsiCo are among its largest holdings.\n\nBe prepared for the fund to lag the market during rallies like the current one. The fund is up 7.1 percent so far this year, which is five percentage points behind the broad S&P 500 index.\n\nIts long-term performance is better, however. The fund is up an annualized 5.6 percent over the last 10 years, or 1.7 percentage points above the S&P 500."
