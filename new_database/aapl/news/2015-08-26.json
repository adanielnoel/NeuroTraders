        "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Apple Inc patents covering the \u201cslide to unlock\u201d feature on smartphones are invalid, Germany\u2019s highest appeals court ruled on Tuesday, reaffirming a 2013 decision rejecting the U.S. company\u2019s claims by a lower court.\n\nThe ruling by the Federal Court of Appeals in Karlsruhe covers one of the Apple iPhone\u2019s most popular defining features, of which makers of rival Android-based phones have developed their own versions.\n\nIn a statement, the appeals court said it confirmed a ruling by the lower Federal Patent Court that canceled Apple\u2019s German patent, based on the technique\u2019s similarity to a phone released by Swedish company Neonode Inc a year before the iPhone\u2019s 2007 launch.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Neonode N1 had substantially similar technical features, the patent court had found. It ruled Apple\u2019s easier-to-use interface was not in itself patentable.\n\nNeonode sold tens of thousands of phones before declaring bankruptcy in 2008. It reorganized itself as an intellectual property firm licensing its patented optical technology for use in phones, tablets, readers and other touchscreen devices.\n\nMotorola Mobility, at the time a unit of Google Inc but now owned by China\u2019s Lenovo Group Ltd, filed the original suit in a Munich court against the Apple user interface patent.\n\nApple won that case but the ruling was later overturned by the federal patent court."
