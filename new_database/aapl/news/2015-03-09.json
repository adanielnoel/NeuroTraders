        "body": "CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook summed up the problem during a conversation with sales staff at a London Apple Store: \u201cWe\u2019ve never sold anything as a company that people could try on before.\u201d\n\nWith the expected launch next month of the Apple Watch, the company\u2019s first new product in five years, Apple will be stepping into new territory.\n\nTo conquer the marketplace, the watch will have to appeal not only as a gadget but as a fashion statement, a fact tacitly acknowledged by Apple\u2019s decision to launch its advertising campaign with a 12-page insert in the March issue of Vogue.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t talking about plans for marketing the Apple Watch in advance of it\u2019s much-touted \u201cSpring Forward\u201d event on Monday, but it clearly intends to keep a tight grip on initial sales and distribution, leaving many retailers guessing about when -- or if -- they\u2019ll be able to sell it.\n\nSources with direct knowledge of the matter said that Best Buy Co Inc, one of the largest sellers of Apple products, may not get the watch at launch time, though the company wouldn\u2019t comment on the situation.\n\nOther large retailers, including Macy\u2018s, Saks 5th Avenue, Bloomingdales and Barney\u2019s said they had no immediate plans to carry the watch. Target and Nordstrom,along with all the major phone carriers, declined to comment on their plans, though a source with knowledge of the situation said Nordstrom has engaged in discussions with Apple.\n\n\u201cApple is being cautious. There are too many unknowns around how this product will perform,\u201d said Van Baker, research vice-president, technology research firm Gartner Inc.\n\nThat might mean restricting initial sales to company stores, where Apple has complete control over the experience and staff can be specially trained to sell the watch, Baker said.\n\nApple\u2019s Cook seems very aware of the challenge. The Telegraph, which sent a reporter with the CEO to the company\u2019s Covent Garden store, reported that he explained to the staff that selling the watch might require \u201ctweaking the experience in the store.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of hard information about what the tweaks might look like, speculation has been intense. The Washington Post last week suggested that Apple might add carpeting and mirrors and change store lighting to enhance the watch-buying experience.\n\nMedia outlets and Websites have also posited that the watch will be offered at special pop-up stores installed at luxury retailers such as Selfridges in London and Colette in Paris.\n\nApple hosted a private event at Colette last September, at which guests were able to try on the watch, but a spokesman for Colette declined to comment on whether the store would carry it.\n\nUntil now, wearable gadgets have not been big sellers for technology companies. Rival products such as Samsung\u2019s Gear watches have sold poorly.\n\nApple hopes to change that, but it is still a big if whether the watch will appeal to buyers seeking a fashion accessory, especially if it needs to be upgraded every few years like Apple\u2019s phones, tablets and computers.\n\n\u201cIt could do wonders for the watch market if it means people might wear watches again, but realistically, there are a lot of doubts,\u201d said Eric Wilson, fashion news director of InStyle.\n\n\u201cFashion customers are more skeptical than anyone, so Apple has picked a tough crowd.\u201d"
