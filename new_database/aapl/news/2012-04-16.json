Consumer products maker Procter & Gamble rose 1.7 percent to $66.94, while shares of Wal-Mart Stores, the world\u2019s largest retailer, gained 1.5 percent to $60.67. The Dow got a lift from both P&G and Wal-Mart.\n\nBut Apple shares dropped 3.6 percent to $583.26, weighing heavily on the Nasdaq. Some investors have been watching a trend line in Apple\u2019s meteoric rise this year and said it was broken on Monday at around the $596 level, leading to more profit taking. The stock is up about 45 percent this year and is susceptible to pullbacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good old-fashioned profit-taking. The stock is, obviously, seeing some consolidation,\u201d said Shaw Wu, technology analyst at Sterne Agee.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a snowball effect. The stock\u2019s been weak the past week\u201d and investors are increasingly cashing out, especially ahead of earnings next week, Wu said.\n\nOther major drags on the Nasdaq included a slide of nearly 10 percent in the shares of Mattel Inc, the world\u2019s largest toy maker, on declining quarterly sales, and a nearly 3.1 percent drop in Google Inc shares ahead of a high-stakes legal battle with Oracle Corp.\n\nSpanish 10-year government bond yields climbed above the 6 percent mark on Monday for the first time since the beginning of December. Spain has acknowledged that it has probably slipped into its second recession since 2009.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 103.50 points, or 0.81 percent, at 12,953.09. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was up 0.80 of a point, or 0.06 percent, at 1,371.06. But the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 21.96 points, or 0.73 percent, at 2,989.37.\n\n\u201cBarring an accelerated flight of assets out of the euro zone and into U.S. equities, we see little reason for equities to rally appreciably above the most recent high,\u201d said Peter Cecchini, managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.\n\n\u201cHaving said this, we are expecting a short-term bounce, which may lead to a retest of 1,400,\u201d he said.\n\nMonday\u2019s mixed session followed last week\u2019s pullback, when both the Dow and the S&P 500 suffered their worst two-week percentage drops since late November on increasing concerns about the euro zone\u2019s debt crisis and weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data.\n\nEarnings season will pick up steam this week, with 86 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report results. According to Thomson Reuters data through Monday, of the 34 S&P 500 companies to have reported earnings so far, 76 percent have reported earnings above analyst expectations.\n\nMattel\u2019s quarterly profit fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations as price increases hurt sales of its iconic Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, sending its stock down 9.8 percent to $30.79."

After a meteoric rise of 43 percent this year, Apple was ripe for profit taking.\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the market\u2019s only worry. Spain\u2019s rising borrowing costs and a weak New York state manufacturing report stirred concerns about Europe\u2019s debt crisis and the U.S. economic recovery.\n\n\u201cThe market behavior is fairly manic today and investors are confused after a mixed set of data, Spanish yields, and momentum stocks like Apple losing ground,\u201d said James Dailey, portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThe confusion is leading to anxiety, and that\u2019s why we are seeing the blue chips, the large caps, outperform.\u201d\n\nOther major drags on the Nasdaq included a slide of 9 percent in the shares of Mattel Inc (MAT.O), the world\u2019s largest toy maker, on declining quarterly sales, and a 3 percent drop in Google Inc (GOOG.O) shares ahead of a high-stakes legal battle with Oracle Corp.

Shares of Oracle ORCL.O gained 0.5 percent to $28.64.\n\nVolume was light, with about 6.25 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below last year\u2019s daily average of 7.84 billion.\n\nAdvancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of 17 to 13, while on the Nasdaq, about 13 stocks rose for every 12 that fell."
