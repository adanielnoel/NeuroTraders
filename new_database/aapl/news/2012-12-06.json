        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile USA said on Thursday it planned to stop subsidizing smartphones, the first major U.S. carrier to do so, in a move it hopes will cut costs and woo customers frustrated with restrictions on upgrades in longer-term contracts.\n\nT-Mobile USA also announced an agreement to sell the iPhone, becoming the last big carrier to sign on with Apple Inc, which will also help it win new customers and keep existing subscribers.\n\nU.S. operators typically pay phone subsidies, giving subscribers discounts in exchange for tying them into a two-year contract. While this helps retain customers, it also ramps up costs, particularly for the higher-priced iPhone.\n\nThe No. 4 mobile service provider, which has been struggling with customer losses, already gives customers the option to pay less for their phone service if they forego a smartphone subsidy.\n\nNext year, T-Mobile USA plans do away with subsidies entirely, Chief Executive John Legere said in parent company Deutsche Telekom\u2019s investor meeting, which was webcast.\n\nThe move will cut T-Mobile USA\u2019s upfront costs but Legere also expects it to appeal to customers, who dislike restrictions on how often they can upgrade their phones under the subsidy model favored by bigger rivals Verizon Wireless Inc, AT&T Inc and Sprint Nextel Corp.\n\n\u201cWe think there is huge room for a challenger to change some of that, in a way that the larger players will not be able to or will choose not to respond to,\u201d the executive said.\n\nUnder the unsubsidized model, Legere said customers will be able to upgrade their phones when they want to by trading in the device. T-Mobile USA\u2019s bigger rivals have been restricting upgrades to keep their subsidy costs under control.\n\nHe did not say when exactly in 2013 the company plans to switch entirely away from subsidizing phones. Around 80 percent of the company\u2019s new phone activations are currently from subscribers who have decided not to pay a subsidy for their device.\n\nWhile T-Mobile USA has long wanted to sell the iPhone, which first went on sale at AT&T in 2007, the phone\u2019s high price appeared to stop it from reaching a deal with Apple.\n\nLegere said that T-Mobile USA worked hard to come to a deal with Apple and promised that the Apple experience would be \u201cdramatically different\u201d compared to other operators.\n\nHe said T-Mobile USA did not have to make the same kind of commitment Sprint made to order a certain number of iPhones, but did not give further details about his company\u2019s deal with Apple.\n\nSprint agreed to pay Apple a minimum of $15.5 billion over four years for selling the iPhone.\n\nLegere did not say when T-Mobile USA would start selling Apple products but said it would be months before he could give more details.\n\nT-Mobile USA has agreed to merge with smaller rival MetroPCS Communications Inc next year."

        "body": "Last month, when a majority of the commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission issued a statement warning about aggressive assertion of standard-essential patents in connection with the merger of two companies that make car air conditioners, Reuters took note. On its own, the FTC\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t particularly interesting. But the antitrust watchdog is reportedly looking into allegations that Google is abusing the portfolio of essential tech patents it acquired in its merger with Motorola. Perhaps the FTC\u2019s statement in the auto air-conditioning case, Reuters said, was an indicator of where the commission stood on Google\u2019s use of Motorola\u2019s patents.\n\nWe now have some more substantive evidence of what the FTC thinks about those patents \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t bode well for Google. This week the agency filed an amicus brief in cross-appeals by Apple and Motorola of Judge Richard Posner\u2018s pox-on-both-your-houses dismissal of their claims against one another last summer. (Posner sits on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals but heard the case as a district judge in federal court in Chicago; Apple and Motorola\u2019s cross-appeals of his ruling are before the Federal Circuit.) The brief claims to be in support of neither party, but in reality the FTC sided squarely with Apple, arguing that when Posner refused to grant Motorola an injunction based on Apple\u2019s unlicensed use of standard-essential patents, the judge correctly applied the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2006 ruling in Ebay v. MercExchange.\n\nMore broadly, the agency asserted that injunctions should not be wielded as a threat in licensing negotiations by holders of standard-essential patents, which are supposed to encourage competition by promoting interoperability. In exchange for the industrywide adoption of their patents, the FTC said, companies like Motorola commit to licensing their patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. \u201cHowever, a royalty negotiation that occurs under the threat of an injunction may be heavily weighted in favor of the patentee in a way that is in tension with the RAND commitment,\u201d the agency\u2019s brief said. \u201cHigh switching costs combined with the threat of an injunction could allow the patentee to obtain unreasonable licensing terms despite its RAND commitment because implementers are locked into practicing the standard.\u201d That\u2019s particularly true, the brief said in an argument that echoed Posner\u2019s ruling, when the patent at issue covers just one component of a complex device. Using the leverage of an injunction in licensing talks \u201cis the essence of hold-up,\u201d the FTC argued.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s brief is hardly the only encroachment on the dominion of Motorola\u2019s standard-essential patents. As you probably remember, two different federal district judges have held that Motorola is obligated by the terms of its agreements with standard-setting bodies to license its IP to third parties (such as Apple and Motorola) on reasonable terms. U.S. District Judge James Robart of Seattle held a bench trial in November todetermine what such terms should be, rejecting Motorola\u2019s attempts to reshape the case. (The company fared better at the end of Apple\u2019s parallel case in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, when U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb decided on the eve of a bench trial that she wasn\u2019t going to go to the trouble of finding a reasonable rate if Apple wouldn\u2019t agree to abide by her ruling.) But the regulator\u2019s firm stance is yet another indication that Motorola\u2019s patents may not be as potent as Google thought when it acquired the company \u2014 particularly because the FTC is reportedly still deciding whether to bring an antitrust action against Motorola.\n\nI should point out that the agency wasn\u2019t the only amicus to file a brief at the Federal Circuit in the Apple and Motorola cross-appeals. Five other amici made appearances. All purported to support neither party, but only the brief from The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers seems truly non-partisan and informational. Abrief by Cisco, Wal-Mart and several other big companies asks the Federal Circuit to clarify a standard for damages that reflects the value of any particular patent to an entire product; the argument seems to be a slap at Apple, which has accused other smart-device makers, including Motorola, of infringing its patents on nifty features. The Intellectual Property Law Association, on the other hand, argued in its amicus brief that the standard Posner applied in deciding that Apple hadn\u2019t shown its potential damages would, if broadly adopted, make it impossible for patent holders to prove how much harm they suffered from infringement. That\u2019s a pro-Apple argument.\n\nLike the FTC, both Verizon and the American Antitrust Institute addressed injunctions based on standard-essential patents in their amicus briefs. Both agreed with the FTC (and Apple) that, generally speaking, injunctions shouldn\u2019t be permitted when patent holders have agreed to license their IP on reasonable terms.\n\nI left a message with Motorola counsel David Nelson of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan but didn\u2019t hear back. Apple\u2019s lawyer in the appeal, Joshua Rosenkranz of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, declined to comment.\n\nFor more of my posts, please go to Thomson Reuters News & Insight"

        "body": "(Reuters) - Lawyers for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd filed a redacted copy of a 10-year patent licensing agreement between Apple Inc and Taiwan\u2019s HTC Corp in a U.S. court late on Wednesday following a judge\u2019s order.\n\nThe Korean electronics company had earlier filed a motion to compel Apple -- with which it is waging a bitter legal battle over mobile patents across several countries -- to reveal details of a settlement that was made with HTC on November 10 but which have been kept under wraps.\n\nThe court last month ordered Apple to disclose to Samsung details of the legal settlement that the iPhone maker reached with HTC, including terms of the 10-year patents licensing agreement.\n\nLegal experts say the question of which patents are covered by the Apple-HTC settlement, and licensing details, could be instrumental in Samsung\u2019s efforts to thwart Apple\u2019s subsequent quest for a permanent sales ban on its products.\n\nThe redacted copy excludes key specifics such as the royalty payments HTC would have to make to Apple for using some of the U.S. company\u2019s patents. Also excluded are details of some of HTC\u2019s covered products that were part of the licensing deal.\n\nThe court order had stated that \u201conly the pricing and royalty terms of license agreements may be sealed.\u201d\n\nHowever, Samsung lawyers said in the filing that they had withheld a few other details of the licensing agreement as requested by Apple and HTC.\n\nAs per the Apple-HTC agreement, the licenses do not include Apple\u2019s design patents, according to a filing made with the District Court of Northern California.\n\nApple and HTC also agreed to fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licenses to certain of the other\u2019s patents.\n\nApple has agreed not to initiate legal action over some of HTC\u2019s covered products. The details of the products were not disclosed.\n\nThe copy of the Apple-HTC deal filed with the court \u201cincorporates redactions HTC requested and the redactions Apple requested, which are a subset of HTC\u2019s redactions. Samsung takes no position on whether the redactions are appropriate at this time,\u201d Samsung\u2019s lawyers said in a filing.\n\nIf all the Apple patents are included -- including the \u201cuser experience\u201d patents that the company has previously insisted it would not license -- it could undermine the iPhone maker\u2019s efforts to permanently ban the sale of products that copy its technology.\n\nIn a previous court filing, Samsung argued that it was \u201calmost certain\u201d that the HTC deal covered some of the patents involved in its own litigation with Apple.\n\nThe case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Apple Inc v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al, No. 11-1846."
