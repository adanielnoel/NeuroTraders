        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said that its recently released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones will be available in more than 115 countries by the end of the year.\n\nThe iPhones will arrive in 36 additional countries and territories across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa by the end of this month, Apple said.\n\nThe iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be made available in China, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market, and India from Oct. 17.\n\nOther countries where the phones will be launched include Israel, Czech Republic, Greenland, Poland, South Africa, Bahrain and Kuwait, making this the fastest rollout of iPhones, the company said.\n\nReuters had earlier reported that the iPhone 6 will be sold in China from Oct 17, after rigorous regulator scrutiny led to Apple reassuring the Chinese government that the smartphones did not have security \u201cbackdoors\u201d through which U.S. agencies can access users\u2019 data."
