        "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Visa Europe has announced a new, more secure way for consumers to pay retailers via smartphones, a move that could set the stage for Apple\u2019s (AAPL.O) Apple Pay and rival mobile payment services to be introduced into Europe in the coming months.\n\nVisa Europe said on Tuesday it would introduce to member banks by mid-April a \u201ctokenisation\u201d service which substitutes random numbers for a user\u2019s credit card details when a merchant transmits transaction data, reducing the risk of online theft.\n\nSimilar security from Visa Inc (V.N), the former parent of Visa Europe, and rival card issuers MasterCard (MA.N) and American Express (AXP.N) has been key to the success of Apple Pay since it was introduced in the United States last year, according to industry experts.\n\nApple Pay allows iPhone users to store their credit card details on their phones, then pay at the tap of a button. In its first three months, more than $2 out of every $3 which U.S. consumers spent using speedy new \u201ccontactless\u201d systems at the three major credit card networks was done via Apple Pay, the company said last month.\n\nVisa Europe\u2019s move is one of several new services the London-based credit card giant is unveiling as it battles to retain its role as a middleman connecting banks and consumers in a fast-moving payments landscape being shaken up by major technology firms including Apple, Google (GOOGL.O) and eBay\u2019s (EBAY.O) PayPal, as well as scores of ambitious start-ups.\n\nThese include a way for card customers to send money overseas to other Visa users via their social media profiles on sites such as Facebook (FB.O), WhatsApp, Twitter (TWTR.N) or LinkedIn LNKD.N.\n\nSteve Perry, Visa Europe\u2019s chief digital officer, said in an interview his association\u2019s plan for secure credit card data transmission parallels what Visa Inc offers in the United States. But he declined to comment on whether Apple Pay had agreed to use his organization\u2019s version in European markets.\n\n\u201cApple and Visa (Inc) have an agreement around what has happened,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI am as excited as anyone, but we have to wait,\u201d he said. The Visa Europe executive referred further questions to Apple.\n\nAn Apple spokesman was not immediately available to comment on any international expansion plans it might have.\n\nVisa Europe, which since 2007 has operated independently of Visa Inc, is a cooperative of more than 3,700 European banks with more than 500 million cards in circulation.\n\nIts plans also include opening a mobile app store for its members to pick and choose payment apps that they can assemble into mobile banking services they offer their own customers.\n\nThe company said it would introduce by this summer a global peer-to-peer payments service called Visa Direct, which was formerly known as Visa Personal Payments and offered on a limited basis.\n\nVisa Europe has partnered with Singapore-based Fastacash to enable its member banks to soon start sending peer-to-peer payments via popular social media services.\n\nVisa Direct will allow Visa Europe card users to transfer funds in multiple currencies to the mobile phone numbers of nearly 2 billion other Visa card holders.\n\nThe personal money transfer service, which complies with \u201cKnow your customer\u201d banking regulations and other international rules, will not be available in the United States, Japan or nations sanctioned by U.S. Treasury Department, it said. Currency exchange fees will be set by the card holder\u2019s bank."
