        "body": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple Inc and computing giant Dell Inc will join a Foxconn-led consortium bidding for Toshiba Corp\u2019s highly prized chip unit, the CEO of the world\u2019s largest contract electronics manufacturer told Reuters on Monday.\n\nTerry Gou, Foxconn\u2019s founder and chief executive, said U.S.-based Kingston Technology Co, a maker of memory products, would also be part of the bidding group, while Amazon.com Inc was close to joining.\n\nThe Taiwanese firm is also in discussions with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc about their participation in the bid, he said.\n\nHe declined to say how much Apple and other U.S. firms planned to invest.\n\n\u201cI can tell you Apple is in for sure,\u201d Gou said in an interview, adding that its participation had been approved by Chief Executive Tim Cook and Apple\u2019s board of directors.\n\nAsked about the total size of the Foxconn-led offer, he declined to give a figure, saying only that it was \u201cvery close\u201d to other bids.\n\nToshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the world\u2019s second-largest producer of NAND chips, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp.\n\nFoxconn, however, has not been seen as a frontrunner for the unit due to its deep ties with China, where it manufactures much of its products. The Japanese government has said it will block any deal that would risk the transfer of key chip technology out of the country.\n\nGou said that the Foxconn-led consortium contained no Chinese capital and had the advantage of not inviting as much antitrust scrutiny as other suitors. He also played down potential opposition from the Japanese government to the bid.\n\n\u201cThe key is that we are all customers, we are users,\u201d he said.\n\nFoxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, and its Japanese unit Sharp Corp would have a combined stake of not more than 40 percent, he added.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and the other U.S. firms named by Gou could not be immediately reached for comment outside of regular business hours. Sharp declined to comment.\n\nSeparately a source familiar with the matter said Japanese telecoms and internet giant SoftBank Group Corp was also part of the Foxconn-led consortium.\n\nSoftBank declined to comment. Toshiba was not immediately available for comment.\n\nGou\u2019s revelations of the Foxconn-led bid come as uncertainty spikes over the make-up of the groups competing in the hotly contest auction just days before Toshiba is due to announce a preferred bidder.\n\nWestern Digital Corp plans to raise its offer for Toshiba\u2019s semiconductor unit, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters over the weekend, in a last-ditch effort to clinch a deal.\n\nThe U.S. chipmaker is part of a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed fund and the group will present the new offer of 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) or more, the source said.\n\nThe news helped Toshiba\u2019s shares climb 9 percent on Monday. The stock is still down 26 percent from levels in late December, before it flagged big losses at its Westinghouse unit.\n\nThe laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate aims to name a winner at a board meeting on June 15. Tokyo, however, has been asking Toshiba to postpone the decision as the government-led consortium has yet to finalize its proposal.\n\nSome sources have said that the state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan, is also exploring a potential consortium with Bain Capital, though it is unclear what other firms would also be members of that group.\n\nWestern Digital has been seen by some sources as crucial to a successful deal, as it jointly operates a key flash-memory chip plant with Toshiba in western Japan.\n\nBut Western Digital and Toshiba have been at loggerheads over the auction. Western Digital is pursuing an international arbitration claim that Toshiba has breached joint-venture contracts by entertaining outside bids.\n\nToshiba has favored a separate bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake to offer 2.2 trillion yen, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters."
