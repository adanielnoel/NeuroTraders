        "body": "HONG KONG/TAIPEI (Reuters) - A debt-laden Chinese technology firm seeking to ban all shipments of Apple\u2019s popular iPad tablet into and out of the country has been told that China\u2019s customs authorities are unlikely to intervene in the trademark battle.\n\nProview Technology, the Chinese company embroiled in a legal battle with Apple Inc over the iPad name, said on Wednesday that customs authorities had told it that the sheer size of the market and the popularity of iPads would make it difficult to impose a ban.\n\n\u201cThe customs have told us that it will be difficult to implement a ban because many Chinese consumers love Apple products. The sheer size of the market is very big,\u201d Yang Long-san, chief of Proview Technology (Shenzhen), told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have applied to some local customs for the ban and they\u2019ll report to the headquarters in Beijing.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, lawyers representing Proview Technology (Shenzhen) Co Ltd said the company would seek a ban on exports of Apple\u2019s iPads from China, a major manufacturing base, a move that could deal a blow to the U.S. technology giant\u2019s sales globally.\n\nAuthorities in some Chinese cities had ordered retailers to stop selling Apple\u2019s iPad due to the dispute. Proview has asked authorities in about 20 cities, including Shijiazhuang near Beijing, to stop the sales.\n\n\u201cWe will be asking commerce departments of more cities to investigate and deal with the case accordingly,\u201d said Roger Xie, a lawyer with Grandall Law Firm, which is representing Proview.\n\nYang said the best option to resolve the legal dispute would be an out-of-court settlement. The next hearing of the case is due for February 22 in Shanghai.\n\nApple lost a case to Proview Technology (Shenzhen) in a Shenzhen court in southern China late last year, when the court agreed that Proview owned the iPad trademark. The next hearing for this case is on February 29.\n\nLocal media reported recently that Proview was taking legal action, seeking up to 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in compensation from Apple for trademark infringement, saying that the compensation could be the last hope to help rescue the company.\n\n\u201cSome people say that Proview wants to take the chance to make a sum of money from Apple and this is tarnishing our company\u2019s reputation. We need to clarify what\u2019s the truth behind it,\u201d Yang said.\n\nHe said there was currently a gap in expectations on both sides, but declined to say whether it was related to the amount of compensation.\n\nProview Technology (Shenzhen) is a unit of troubled Hong Kong-listed Proview International Holdings, which used to be one of the world\u2019s top monitor makers until the financial crisis in 2008 crippled its business and operations.\n\nReuters correspondents visited the site of its operations in Shenzhen listed on its website and found that the building has largely been abandoned, with its windows shattered and debris strewn liberally.\n\nProview International, whose shares have been on a trading halt since August 2010, posted a net loss of HK$755.8 million ($97 million) in the six months ended December 2009, which was the last time it published financial results.\n\nProview International\u2019s shares last traded at HK$0.20. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s shares ended at $509.46, setting a record high on hopes of strong iPhone 4S demand and investor optimism over the potential launch of a new iPad in 2012.\n\nApple says it bought Proview\u2019s worldwide rights to the trademark in 10 different countries several years ago, including rights to the iPad name from a Taiwan subsidiary of Proview International.\n\nBack then, the Proview Taiwan unit had sold the rights to IP Application Development Ltd, a London-based company that was set up by Apple, for 35,000 pounds, Proview\u2019s executives and lawyers said. IP Application Development then sold the iPad name to Apple for 10 pounds months later, they said.\n\nHowever, Proview Technology (Shenzhen) says the sale did not cover the trademark\u2019s use in China, where it owns the iPad name.\n\nYang said the company had been developing a tablet product called the iPad back in 2000.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of resources on it. It\u2019s the same concept as the iPad today, except that back then, there were practically no LCD screens,\u201d Yang said."

        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Working conditions at Chinese manufacturing plants where Apple Inc\u2019s iPads and iPhones are made are far better than those at garment factories or other facilities elsewhere in the country, according to the head of a non-profit agency investigating the plants.\n\nThe Fair Labor Association (FLA) is beginning a study of the working conditions of Apple\u2019s top eight suppliers in China, following reports of worker suicides, a plant explosion and slave-like conditions at one of those suppliers, Foxconn Technology Group.\n\nAuret van Heerden, president of the FLA offered no immediate conclusions on the working conditions, but he noted that boredom and alienation could have contributed to the stress that led some workers to take their own lives.\n\nIn addition to Foxconn, FLA investigators will later visit facilities of Quanta Computer Inc, Pegatron Corp, Wintek Corp and other suppliers, who are notoriously tight-lipped about their operations.\n\nAfter his first visits to Foxconn, van Heerden said, \u201cThe facilities are first-class; the physical conditions are way, way above average of the norm.\u201d\n\nHe spent the past several days visiting Foxconn plants to prepare for the study.\n\n\u201cI was very surprised when I walked onto the floor at Foxconn, how tranquil it is compared with a garment factory,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the problems are not the intensity and burnout and pressure-cooker environment you have in a garment factory. . It\u2019s more a function of monotony, of boredom, of alienation perhaps.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the organization has been dealing with suicides in Chinese factories since the 1990s.\n\n\u201dYou have lot of young people, coming from rural areas, away from families for the first time,\u201c he said. \u201dThey\u2019re taken from a rural into an industrial lifestyle, often quite an intense one, and that\u2019s quite a shock to these young workers.\n\n\u201dAnd we find that they often need some kind of emotional support, and they can\u2019t get it,\u201c he added. Factories initially didn\u2019t realize those workers needed emotional support.\u201d\n\nVan Heerden dismissed the notion that his organization might paint a cursory and positive picture of Apple\u2019s suppliers.\n\nCompanies that join the FLA abide by rigorous commitments, and their interests are balanced by non-governmental organizations and more than 200 universities that sit on the board of the organization with the corporations, he said.\n\nFLA evolved from a group originally convened by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1996 with the goal of reducing sweatshop labor around the world. Its board includes executives from sneaker companies Nike and Adidas.\n\n\u201dApple didn\u2019t need to join the FLA,\u201c he said. \u201dThe FLA system is very tough. It involves unannounced visits, complete access, public reporting.\n\n\u201cIf Apple wanted to take the easy way out there were a whole host of options available to them,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact that they joined the FLA shows they were really serious about raising their game.\u201d\n\nSome 30 FLA staff members are visiting two Foxconn factories in Shenzhen in southern China and one in the central city of Chengdu. Each plant has about 100,000 workers, although not all work on Apple products.\n\nOver three weeks, some 35,000 workers will be interviewed about 30 at a time to answer questions anonymously, entering their responses onto Apple iPads.\n\n* how the workers were hired\n\n* if they were paid a fee\n\n* if they were offered and signed contracts and whether they understood them\n\n* the condition of their dorm rooms and food\n\n* if complaints are acted upon\n\n* their emotional well being\n\nThe data will be uploaded immediately and consolidated, and an interim report will be made public in early March.\n\nThe eventual FLA report will identify areas the suppliers need to improve and offer suggestions, van Heerden said.\n\n\u201cThere might not be a clear policy on hiring, that could lead unwittingly to discrimination against hepatitis B sufferers,\u201d he said as an example.\n\n\u201cThere might not be adequate documentation that could lead to the risk that workers get hired with fake documentation, that underage workers come in . We can recommend very specific actions they can take.\u201d"

The index had been up as much as 1,080.30 after the Greek commitment.\n\n\u201cThe market does not like it - if Greece cannot get a bailout by mid-March it effectively has a messy default,\u201d said Richard Batty, strategist at Standard Life Investments, which has $248.37 billion of assets under management. \u201cThe country must act now to make the extra spending cuts as there is a danger of contagion to the rest of the market if a chaotic default occurs.\u201d\n\nTraders said the market could fall by as much as 10 percent if a Greek chaotic default looked certain.\n\nOverall U.S. industrial output was unexpectedly flat in January, but a second straight month of gains in the manufacturing component pointed to a strengthening economy, data from the Federal Reserve showed.\n\nSafe-haven U.S. and German government bond prices rose on the possibility of delaying the bailout.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 1/32 in price to yield 1.93 percent.\n\nBund futures were last up 53 ticks on the day at 139.05, and some traders said they could push to around 140 if Greece\u2019s fate continues to look uncertain.\n\nBrent oil settled at an eight-month high as fears of supply disruptions from Iran, other Middle Eastern producers and Africa outweighed worries about the global economy.\n\nBut concerns about the outcome of Greek bailout talks in Brussels among euro zone officials limited the day\u2019s rises.\n\nIn London, ICE April Brent crude settled at $118.93 a barrel, gaining $1.58 and posting the highest close since June 14.\n\nU.S. March crude settled at $101.80 a barrel, gaining $1.06, the highest close in a month. Brent\u2019s premium against its U.S. counterpart narrowed to $16.79 at the close.\n\nGold was lifted by crude oil\u2019s gains as it broke ranks with the euro and U.S. equities. While seen as a safe haven, the metal has tracked the fortunes of riskier assets in recent months as market turbulence caused by the debt crisis forced investors to sell gold to cover losses elsewhere.\n\nU.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $10.40 at $1,728.10."
