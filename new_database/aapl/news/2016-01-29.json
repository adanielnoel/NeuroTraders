        "body": "(Reuters) \u2013 The world learned a couple of very interesting facts last week about Google\u2019s Android operating system. Since its release, Android has generated about $31 billion in revenue and $22 billion in profit. Google meanwhile pays Apple big money \u2013 $1 billion in 2014 \u2013 to keep its search bar on the iPhone. Those previously unknown details of Google\u2019s finances, as my Reuters colleague Dan Levine has reported, became public via Oracle\u2019s epic litigation accusing Google of infringing its copyrights on Java application programming interfaces.\n\nThe information came out during a Jan. 14 hearing on a discovery dispute before U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu of San Francisco. Oracle lawyer Annette Hurst of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe, responding to a question from the judge and assertions by Google, disclosed the Google financial details, which subsequently made headlines when Bloomberg reporters got hold of the hearing transcript.\n\nNow Google wants Oracle and Orrick to be sanctioned for revealing confidential information produced under a protective order. On Wednesday, Google lawyers from King & Spalding filed a letter asking permission to move for a contempt finding and sanctions, arguing that \u201cself-serving\u201d disclosures by Oracle and Orrick \u201creveal a profound disregard for this court\u2019s protective order. Google and third parties have been harmed by this disclosure and are at risk of further harm from future improper disclosures.\u201d (Google\u2019s lead counsel in the Oracle case is Keker & Van Nest, but the sanction letter said Orrick has been a Keker client so only K&S signed the filing.)\n\nGoogle has been protesting the Orrick disclosures since the hearing itself. As the company explained in a Jan. 20 letter to Judge Ryu, Google lawyers moved immediately after Hurst revealed information about its agreement with Apple to redact and seal the hearing transcript. The magistrate denied Google\u2019s oral motion, but on Jan. 21, Google filed a formal motion to redact not only the Apple payment information but also disclosures about Android revenue and profits. (The company said it does not ordinarily break out Android finances.)\n\n\u201cHad Oracle provided Google with notice of its intent to disclose such confidential information \u2013 as the protective order requires and as has been the parties\u2019 past practice in this case \u2013 Google could have addressed this issue before the hearing,\u201d the motion said. \u201cBut, due to Oracle\u2019s failure to provide the notice \u007f Google has been forced to take immediate steps to limit the potential harmful impact of that disclosure by filing this motion. Google should not be punished for Oracle\u2019s intentional misconduct.\u201d\n\nOracle wasn\u2019t exactly apologetic in its response later that day. The company said it didn\u2019t take any position on whether the hearing transcript should be redacted and sealed, but pointed out that Google didn\u2019t object at the hearing to the revelation of Android financial information, so it shouldn\u2019t be permitted after the fact to seal those disclosures.\n\nMoreover, Oracle said, the protective order in the case allows both sides to disclose confidential information to the court, which is what happened at the hearing. Oracle wasn\u2019t expecting to reveal confidential financial statistics, the company said, but when the magistrate asked about Google\u2019s apportionment of profits, Oracle\u2019s lawyer, Hurst, answered the judge\u2019s question. Hurst only disclosed revenue details, Oracle said, to correct an assertion by Google\u2019s lawyer that the data was contained in deposition testimony.\n\nAs for the Apple payment revelation, Oracle said, obliquely, that Google was on notice that the \u201ceconomics of platform distribution\u201d might arise during the hearing. In a declaration accompanying Oracle\u2019s submission, Orrick partner Hurst said specifically that she informed Google lawyers at a meeting in December to discuss the Jan. 14 hearing that many of Oracle\u2019s remedy theories take into account Google\u2019s payments to third parties. She also noted that Google lawyers also disclosed confidential information at the hearing from Oracle experts.\n\nOracle\u2019s response provoked Google\u2019s sanction letter, which highlights Oracle\u2019s \u201crefusal to remedy the violations.\u201d Google said its proposed motion will seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with Oracle\u2019s supposed breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe hearing transcript is now under seal while the magistrate reconsiders her previous decision not to keep it under wraps.\n\nAs for the contempt letter, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, who is overseeing the case, said in an order Thursday that the matter would be postponed until after trial, which is scheduled to begin in May.\n\nFor more of my posts, please go to WestlawNext Practitioner Insights"
