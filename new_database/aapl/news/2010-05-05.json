        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Software developers expect a windfall in ad revenue from games and other applications they are designing for the iPad, but Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) push into mobile advertising is raising some industry hackles.\n\nApple said last month that its new advertising network, dubbed iAd, will sell display advertisements within the software applications, or apps, for the iPhone and iPad, and aims to improve their quality and relevance to consumers.\n\nBut in its new agreement with developers, Apple prohibits data about app usage to be transmitted to outside analytics companies. Rival ad networks, such as Google Inc\u2018s, rely on those analyses to determine how successful an online ad is in reaching its targeted audience.\n\nThus, the new rules could create a unequal playing field for ad networks competing against Apple\u2018s, some app developers say.\n\nBecause of that, iAd is drawing interest from U.S. competition regulators, according to one developer, who said the Federal Trade Commission has asked him specifically about Apple\u2019s ad network.\n\n\u201cThey asked about the sharing of information with third parties,\u201d said the developer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the FTC did not indicate whether it planned to pursue an inquiry.\n\nApple and the FTC declined to comment. The iAd network is not the only piece of Apple\u2019s mobile platform generating scrutiny. Regulators are considering an inquiry into whether Apple violates antitrust law by requiring that its tools be used to write applications for the iPad and iPhone, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nParan Johar, chief marketing officer of rival mobile ad network Jumptap, said he saw huge promise for mobile advertising in the iPad, but he was critical of Apple\u2019s approach to ads.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the iPad and the iPhone is that Apple is taking its traditional approach of being a closed system,\u201d he said.\n\nResearch group Gartner expects the mobile advertising market to rise 78 percent to $1.6 billion in 2010.\n\nMany app developers see the iPad as an opportunity to generate ad sales: although the tablet is not a go-everywhere device in the same way as the iPhone, its 9.7-inch screen means ads can be more advanced and more appealing.\n\nWhen it introduced iAd last month, Apple said it had the potential to make 1 billion ad impressions a day on its mobile devices, which number in the tens of millions.\n\nAlthough Apple has played down the financial prospects for the network, Broadpoint AmTech analyst Brian Marshall has estimated iAd could generate more than $2 billion in annual revenue for Apple when it is fully deployed.\n\nApple will sell and host the ads, putting it in direct competition with Google and others. App developers would pocket 60 percent of the ad revenue.\n\n\u201cWhoever offers the best ad experience is who we\u2019ll go with,\u201d said Shravan Goli, president of Dictionary.com, in an interview in April. The company\u2019s app has been downloaded 6.5 million times on the iPhone, and 75,000 times on the iPad.\n\n\u201cThere is a concern in terms of the access to data and how much insight marketers can get,\u201d he said.\n\nStartup developer Pinger found success on the iPhone, and believes the iPad will expand that opportunity. It charges for its Textfree app and also sells ads within its other apps.\n\nPinger co-founder Joe Sipher said he expects the ad-supported part of his business to surpass paid downloads, and said he was \u201cagnostic\u201d when it comes which ad network the company worked with.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of potential for the iPad in advertising, having the bigger screen real estate really enables new things,\u201d Sipher said.\n\n\u201cWhat Apple is starting to do with iAd, if they can make the ad more attractive, then we\u2019re for it,\u201d he said.\n\nApple sold more than 1 million iPads in less than a month after launch. Developers have already created more than 5,000 apps specifically for the tablet, which can also run the vast majority of the 200,000 apps available for the iPhone.\n\nSome vendors are charging much more for their iPad apps, and the device seems tailor-made for game makers and media companies. Electronic Arts ERTS.O is charging $10 for its Scrabble iPad app, twice what it charges on the iPhone.\n\nBut developers of some apps that made a lot of sense on the iPhone -- a communications device that travels everywhere -- will have to change them significantly to appeal to users of the iPad, which is more of a couch-and-coffee-shop device.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different, whereas the iPhone is for utility, the iPad is about content consumption,\u201d Jumptap\u2019s Johar said."

        "body": "AT&T and Apple probably have a quid pro quo in place that has extended the mobile carrier\u2019s exclusive deal with the iPhone in exchange for heavily-discounted data plan pricing for the iPad, an analyst said today.\n\n\u201cAT&T had to do something dramatic to get the iPad,\u201d said Brian Marshall, a Wall Street analyst at BroadPoint AmTech. AT&T\u2019s move was to discount their normal wireless data plans by 50% to iPad customers.\n\nAs part of the tit-for-tat, AT&T got what it wanted. \u201cFor that pricing [on the iPad], AT&T was able to negotiate a six-month extension on the iPhone exclusive,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nMost analysts had expected the AT&T-Apple deal to expire this summer, three years after the two companies first partnered on the iPhone. At one time, Marshall was among those who figured that the expiration meant Verizon, the country\u2019s largest mobile provider, would also sell the iPhone this year.\n\nMarshall now believes that Verizon won\u2019t have the iPhone until the first quarter of 2011. He based his opinion on the failure of Verizon earlier this year to land an exclusive wireless deal with Apple for the latter\u2019s iPad media tablet, a move he said numerous sources had told him was a \u201ccertainty\u201d .\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t happened -- something Marshall said \u201cfloored\u201d him -- he began to think there had to be a reason why AT&T landed the iPad and offered such cut-rate deals on its data plans. Thus arose the idea that Apple and AT&T exchanged an extension on the iPhone for lower-priced 3G data plans on the iPad .\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re pre-paid,\u201d he noted, referring to AT&T\u2019s willingness to forgo contracts with iPad owners, something it\u2019s never done for the iPhone. AT&T offers two iPad data plans, a $15 per month plan for 250MB of data and an unlimited data plan for $30 per month.\n\nTalk of Apple dumping its exclusive deal with AT&T this summer and adding one or more rivals to its U.S. partner list have circulated for some time, and continue to pop up now and again. Two months ago, for instance, rumors that Verizon would get the iPhone drove up the price of Verizon\u2019s stock.\n\nAT&T and Apple did not immediately reply to requests seeking comment on a deal to extend their exclusive iPhone contract.\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

        "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters.com) - Phillip Leslie needed software coders to develop mobile applications for his fledgling startup, ProOnGo LLC, which offers a solution to keep track of business receipts on a smartphone, using the device\u2019s built-in camera. The cash-strapped Chicago entrepreneur put out a job listing at the Illinois Institute of Technology; within a few days he was flooded with more than 100 applications.\n\n\u201cWe got more resumes than we could sort through,\u201d said Leslie, who added he has employed 11 IIT student programmers.\n\nStudent interest in mobile computing was so great, the university developed a makeshift lab focused on developing applications for devices such as Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad, and phones using Google\u2019s Android operating system. It also has attracted businesses like ProOnGo, which helps keep students apprised of how the competitive market for mobile computing works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a company that\u2019s really powered by the classroom,\u201d said Leslie, who has re-located his nine-person operation alongside other startups in IIT\u2019s technology park, where six student engineers are currently part of the staff. \u201cIn many ways we benefit from all the work that people do here.\u201d\n\nAt present, some 70 students throughout the university touch the mobile computing world in some facet, taking classes in iPhone and Android software programing or working on real-word applications such as a mobile identifier of flora and fauna for a local zoo and an app that reproduces police-like field-sobriety tests to help prevent drunk driving.\n\nInvolvement is not limited to one field of expertise, but intersects several educational disciplines, including business, engineering and even humanities, which now offers a course of study in technical communications.\n\n\u201cI want this to be a resource for whatever the students are looking for,\u201d said Nik Rokop, managing director of IIT\u2019s Jules F. Knapp Entrepreneurship Center, an affiliate of the university\u2019s Stuart School of Business, and host to the mobile app lab.\n\n\u201cWe have classes, we have the IPRO (Interprofessional Projects Program) program; we have this kind of co-curricular activity which hopefully results in business, and we have the actual businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the whole continuum. Students, faculty, alumni and tech park tenants can get the resources they need.\u201d\n\nThe enthusiasm for mobile computing was evident on a recent day at the center, which is housed at the university\u2019s sprawling campus on Chicago\u2019s south side. Students milled about the informal lab space, munching on take-out at their computers while providing demos of projects such as the IIT Navigator, a mobile app that provides maps, current event listings and access to the campus radio station for the university community.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to focus and build expertise,\u201d said Nikhil Mandrekar, 24, who runs the lab and recently graduated from the school\u2019s business administration and applied science program. \u201cWe get clients from all over the place.\u201d\n\nThe lab students\u2019 own preferences for mobile devices spanned the market spectrum, including iPhones, BlackBerrys and Android phones as well as more traditional cellphones.\n\nRokop, who serves as mentor to the students, said part of his role involves linking the university\u2019s technology developments to Chicago\u2019s broader business community. He came up with the idea for the lab last October and it quickly caught on. With minimal investment, it has already sparked broader university awareness; one professor just ordered 30 iPads for a programing class.\n\n\u201cI tend to be a catalyst,\u201d Rokop said. \u201cThis kind of activity brings in professors and brings in more students.\u201d\n\nTechnology experts said the school\u2019s foray into mobile computing is on the cutting edge, as not many universities have yet to develop practical skill-based curricula that can be directly applied to the market.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really innovative,\u201d said Mark Suster, a partner with GRP, a Los Angeles-based venture capital firm focused on technology investments.\n\n\u201cThe mobile environment is different,\u201d Suster said, noting that developing applications for mobile environments calls for awareness of issues such as the limitations of battery power and the need to operate on lower bandwidths. \u201cAny institution that understands how is definitely ahead of most universities.\u201d\n\nDespite the market\u2019s promise, students can see firsthand there\u2019s no easy road to developing a successful app. Leslie\u2019s company, ProOnGo, was originally born out of a new venture contest at the University of Chicago\u2019s MBA program some three years ago; it is still not profitable, despite its software being selected as the top choice among expense programs for BlackBerry users since last July. Leslie said he hopes to be cash flow positive by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOur plan from the beginning was to support as many different smart phones as we could,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work, especially when you\u2019re doing mobile business-to-business apps.\u201d"

        "body": "Verizon subscribers would jump at the chance to have an iPhone, with more than half of those surveyed saying they would likely switch to an Apple handset, a recently-released poll said.\n\nSaying that there is \u201can unprecedented level of pent-up demand for the iPhone among Verizon subscribers,\u201d Rockville, Md.-based market research firm ChangeWave said its survey of more than 4,000 consumers pegged Verizon as the U.S. carrier most likely to reap massive rewards if Apple opens up the iPhone to other providers.\n\nOf those polled who are currently Verizon subscribers, 19% said they were \u201cvery likely\u201d to buy an iPhone if it became available to the carrier, with another 34% answering that they were \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to buy. Both numbers were higher than those for either Sprint or T-Mobile subscribers.\n\n\u201cIf Verizon were ever to offer the iPhone, the evidence points to it having a profound and likely transformative impact on the industry,\u201d ChangeWave\u2019s report of last week said.\n\nBrian Marshall, a financial analyst with BroadPoint AmTech who tracks Apple , agreed. \u201cI think the upside for Verizon [and the iPhone] is tremendous,\u201d he said today. \u201cIf Verizon gets the iPhone in the March 2011 timeframe, as I expect, Verizon will sell at least 11 million iPhones in the calendar year.\u201d\n\nChangeWave also asked U.S. consumers their opinions of their mobile carriers, whether they planned to switch carriers within the next 90 days, and how many dropped calls they\u2019d encountered in the last three months.\n\nPerhaps surprising to some, only 8% of the consumers now using AT&T said they were \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to switch, significantly fewer than said the same for Sprint (10%) and T-Mobile (14%). ChangeWave credited the lower percentage of AT&T users looking to change to the iPhone lock-in.\n\n\u201cAT&T\u2019s low churn rate -- despite its relatively poor Very Satisfied rating and its high percentage of dropped calls -- is attributable to the huge advantage it continues to maintain as the exclusive U.S. service provider for the Apple iPhone,\u201d the market research company said. While 45% of the survey respondents who use Verizon told ChangeWave that they were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their service, only 15% of those subscribing to AT&T said the same.\n\nMarshall agreed. \u201cAT&T is God-awful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what people are saying is \u2018Don\u2019t take away my iPhone.'\u201d\n\nChangeWave\u2019s survey results on dropped calls buttress the complaints made by iPhone users since Apple introduced the smartphone: AT&T\u2019s network performance is sub-standard. According to ChangeWave, 4.5% of those polled who use AT&T reported dropped calls in the last 90 days, the highest number of any of the four major U.S. providers. Only 1.5% of Verizon subscribers, for instance, said that they\u2019d experienced dropped calls in the same period.\n\nAT&T has been hammered on the issue unfairly, some have said, pointing out that no other U.S. carrier has had to handle the massive data demand that iPhone users produce. That hasn\u2019t stopped users from complaining, or in some cases, from filing lawsuits against the mobile provider. It\u2019s possible, say the pro-AT&T commentators, that any carrier, Verizon included, would drop calls and suffer from poor network performance if it also sold the iPhone.\n\nChangeWave\u2019s report on its March wireless survey can be downloaded from the company\u2019s site ( download PDF )\n\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .
