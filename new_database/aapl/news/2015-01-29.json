        "body": "* Dollar eases on talk Fed could sound more dovish on policy\n\nTOKYO/SYDNEY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Asian stocks showed some resilience on Wednesday as investors speculated whether the Federal Reserve could take a dovish turn in its post-meeting statement later in the session, amid signs a stronger dollar was hurting U.S. corporate profits.\n\nApple Inc also provided some relief after the bell as record iPhone sales helped it beat expectations, sending its stock up more than 5 percent.\n\nYahoo Inc gained more than 6 percent in after-hours trading on its plans to spin off its 15 percent stake in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, responding to pressure to hand its prized e-commerce investment over to shareholders.\n\nThose moves helped U.S. stock futures rise 0.7 percent in Asia even as earnings from other U.S. majors generally disappointed, with multinationals from DuPont to Microsoft Corp complaining that a strong U.S. dollar was hurting profits.\n\nEuropean shares were expected to keep their bullish tone since the European Central Bank unveiled quantitative easing last week, with spreadbetters seeing rise of around one percent in Britain\u2019s FTSE, Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC40.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.2 percent to hit a four-month high while the Nikkei also gained 0.2 percent to one-month high.\n\n\u201cThe ECB quantitative easing was very powerful. Asian markets saw big fund inflows. The falls in oil prices reduced inflation risk, allowing many central banks in emerging markets to ease policy,\u201d said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities\n\nSingapore\u2019s central bank in fact eased monetary policy unexpectedly on Wednesday ahead of its scheduled review in April, joining a growing list of central banks that took steps to counter disinflation and slowing growth.\n\nThe latest U.S. economic news was mixed with surprisingly soft durable goods orders, but notable strength in housing and consumer sentiment.\n\nSoft business investment and corporate earnings stoked talk the Fed would have to acknowledge the more difficult environment in its policy statement at 1400 GMT.\n\nSo far, the Fed has stuck by plans to raise interest rates around the middle of 2015, but markets have relentlessly pushed the timing out to year-end and are plotting a much lower trajectory for future hikes.\n\nFed funds <0#FF:> imply a rate of only 45 basis points by December, compared to the current effective funds rate of 12 basis points.\n\n\u201cThe market now thinks a rate hike around June is unlikely. So if the Fed does not change its tone, the market will take it as a bit more hawkish than expected,\u201d said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities.\n\nJust the risk of a dovish turn was enough to force speculators to cut back on crowded short positions in the euro, lifting the common currency to $1.1372 and away from Monday\u2019s 11-year low of $1.1098.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 117.92 yen and retreated against a basket of major currencies to 94.092, off an 11-year high of 95.481 hit on Friday.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices were pressured by news U.S. oil stockpiles surged by nearly 13 million barrels last week.\n\nBrent crude oil dipped to $49.01 a barrel while U.S. crude oil futures slipped to $45.57.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) quarterly results smashed Wall Street expectations with record sales of big-screen iPhones in the holiday shopping season and a 70 percent rise in China sales, powering the company to the largest profit in corporate history.\n\nThe company sold 74.5 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, while many analysts had expected fewer than 70 million. Revenue rose to $74.6 billion from $57.6 billion a year earlier.\n\nProfit of $18 billion was the biggest ever reported by a public company, worldwide, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Apple\u2019s cash pile is now $178 billion, enough to buy IBM (IBM.N) or the equivalent to $556 for every American.\n\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the Cupertino, California-based company would release its next product, the Apple Watch, in April.\n\nShares rose about 5 percent to $114.90 in after-hours trade.\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Apple-shareholder Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia, said that the report was a good sign in a quarter where big tech companies such as IBM and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have disappointed.\n\nApple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview that the company did not sell more iPhones in China than the United States, despite some earlier predictions by research analysts.\n\nBut the big-screen iPhone 6 and 6 plus drove revenues in China were up 70 percent in the quarter from a year earlier. The company\u2019s success in the competitive Chinese market can be attributed to its partnership with China Mobile Ltd (0941.HK), the largest global mobile carrier, and the appeal of the larger screen size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\nMaestri said he does not expect Apple to struggle because of China\u2019s slipping economic growth. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a slowdown,\u201d he added.\n\nMaestri also said the company doubled iPhone sales in Singapore and Brazil.\n\nApple will reach 40 company stores in greater China by mid-2016, Maestri told analysts on a conference call.\n\nCarolina Milanesi, an analyst with Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, also lauded a 14 percent rise in unit sales of Apple Macintosh computers and sales of older iPhone models.\n\nApple was well positioned for the current quarter in China, she added, which will include the Chinese New Year holiday and reflect Apple\u2019s attempts to sell through new channels.\n\nApple reported net profit of $18.02 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share, compared with $13.07 billion, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier. That topped expectations of $2.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts had expected revenue of $67.69 billion.\n\nMaestri said that Apple faced \u201ca clear headwind\u201d from the strong dollar but that it had included the challenge in its forecasts. Apple predicted revenue of $52 billion to $55 billion in its fiscal second quarter, compared with Wall Street\u2019s average target of $53.79 billion.\n\nCook said that the company\u2019s new mobile payment service, Apple Pay, which lets customer buy products from select merchants with their phones, was in its \u201cfirst inning\u201d and the company would consider adding new features as it looked at expanding outside the United States."
