        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO Sept 9 (Reuters) - With its highly profitable iPhone due for an upgrade, Apple is expected to unveil a pair of new handsets at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday, analysts say, in addition to showing off a larger iPad and an updated Apple TV.\n\nWhen Apple executives take the stage at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, investors will be scrutinizing their plans for the next generation of the iPhone, which drove nearly two-thirds of the company\u2019s $49.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter.\n\nApple is widely expected to keep the size of the phones the same but upgrade it with an improved camera and Force Touch, a display technology that responds differently depending on how hard users press their screens.\n\nA year after Apple rolled out iPhones with larger screens, touching off a frenzy of sales that saw revenue in the most recent quarter increase 32.5 percent from the same quarter a year ago, the latest upgrades may leave some investors and consumers underwhelmed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder for Apple to compete against itself,\u201d said analyst Bob O\u2018Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple shares closed at $112.31 on Tuesday and are up 14 percent over the last year, although they are down nearly 12 percent in the last three months.\n\nFortunately for Apple, most consumers buy smartphones under a two-year upgrade cycle, meaning the company will still likely scoop up a lot of sales, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\n\u201cThe key point of reference is not how the new phone compares to the iPhone 6, it\u2019s how it compares to the iPhone 5s,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother likely focus of the event is Apple TV, a set-top box that has seen few significant updates since its release in 2007. Although Apple has yet to hammer out deals for a long-awaited television service, analysts say the company is poised to overhaul the hockey-puck-sized device.\n\nExpected updates include an App Store and a new user interface that allows users to make requests through the Siri digital assistant and search for specific programs and movies across apps. The company may also discuss the device\u2019s role as a hub for gaming.\n\nNearly 20 percent of U.S. broadband households own at least one streaming media player, and Apple has a long way to go in the market, according to data from research firm Parks Associates.\n\nRoku is the leader in streaming media boxes, accounting for 34 percent of all streaming devices sold in the United States in 2014, according to data from research firm Parks Associates. Google Inc\u2019s Chromecast and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Fire TV were next. The Apple TV box came in fourth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that (Apple) come out and really get up to date and potentially eclipse some of the other living room devices out there,\u201d Moorhead said.\n\nApple is also expected to pay some attention to its iPad line, rolling out a larger tablet. Amid slumping sales, Apple has tried to push the iPad into the enterprise market, and a gadget with a bigger screen may appeal to some professionals seeking to swap out their laptops for tablets, analysts say.\n\nBut any boost from the enterprise will probably not be enough to offset consumers\u2019 waning interest in the device, O\u2018Donnell said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change the arc of the iPad,\u201d he said.

        "body": "REUTERS - With a long-awaited update to its TV set-top box, Apple on Wednesday revealed a glimpse of its plans to conquer the living room, which analysts say the tech giant has neglected as its other gadgets deepen their hold on consumers.\n\nAt a San Francisco event in which it also rolled out new iPhones and a larger iPad, Apple gave Apple TV a makeover, complete with a full-fledged App Store, integration with Siri and a new touch-sensitive remote control.\n\nBut as it zeroes in on the living room, Apple will face fierce competition from firms such as Amazon and Roku, whose products offer many of the Apple TV\u2019s features at lower price.\n\nThe new Apple set top boxes go on sale at the end of October starting at $149.\n\nThe iPhone maker has already changed TV viewing, making it easier to watch shows almost anywhere. But the living room remains a coveted destination for tech companies as the site where consumers end their days and gather with their families.\n\n\u201cThe holy grail\u201d is how Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of U.S. business at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, a consumer research firm, described it.\n\nApple is rolling out Apple TV as investors call for the company to lessen its dependence on the iPhone, which drove nearly two-thirds of its sales in the most recent quarter.\n\nApple TV could become a significant source of profit for the company, analysts say, but revenue from programming and services will be key. Wednesday\u2019s announcement did not include an Apple streaming TV service that bundles cable channels, which industry executives say the company is exploring.\n\nAnalyzing the 2012 model of Apple TV, technology research firm IHS estimated that the $99 gadget cost $66.15 to make, making its margins considerably lower than other Apple products. The new box has yet to be analyzed, but Apple\u2019s business model is likely the same, said analyst Kevin Keller of IHS.\n\nThe new App Store opens what had been a mostly closed environment to thousands of developers, said Jason Krikorian, general partner at DCM Ventures and a co-founder of Sling Media, creator of the Slingbox streaming media device.\n\n\u201cIf Hollywood\u2019s brightest minds can be put toward delivering content on the many Apple-controlled screens in someone\u2019s home, I think they can make new television viewing experiences,\u201d he said.\n\nRoku also boasts an open platform for developers. But with its loyal base of users, Apple has an edge, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.\n\n\u201cThe key will be helping developers get off the ground quickly,\u201d he said, and then convincing consumers to buy the TV based on the apps available for it.\n\nThe new Apple TV tackles one of the most frustrating parts of modern TV viewing \u2013 finding what to watch. The Siri voice feature lets people search with simple commands such as \u201cfind movies with Jason Bateman,\u201d based on a demonstration at Wednesday\u2019s event.\n\nBut Apple is playing catch up in this area. Voice search is already available on the competing Roku and Amazon Fire TV streaming boxes and Comcast Corp\u2019s X1 platform for pay TV subscribers.\n\nAnd none is yet truly universal in searching all major types of TV content. Apple\u2019s search will initially be limited to content on iTunes and apps from HBO, Showtime, Netflix and Hulu, said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Internet software and services.\n\nThe Apple TV will have a special focus on games, aiming to win over casual players as the iPhone has. Apple TV will run the same operating system as the iPad and iPhone, making it easy for developers to bring their games to the device.\n\nBut Apple will need more than quantity, said Barbara Kraus, an industry analyst at Parks Associates. \u201cThey are going to have to get games that have buzz,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd Apple TV\u2019s greatest rival may be the traditional television set, which remains the dominant media platform, though usage of streaming devices such as set-top boxes and gaming consoles is on the rise among all age groups, according to Nielsen data.\n\nUse is highest among the millennial generation of 18- to 34-year-olds. About 30 percent of millennials use a streaming device per quarter, Nielsen data show, and they use it for about 23 days on average for 2.5 hours per day.\n\nSmart TV holdouts might find themselves entranced by Apple TV if they give the gadget a chance, Milanesi predicted.\n\n\u201cIt draws you in,\u201d she said."

Others are more recent. They include:\n\n* NextInput Inc: Atlanta, Georgia spin-off from Georgia Tech, maker of force-sensitive technology. Investors include Intel Corp and Takata Corp.\n\n* Immersion Corp numbers among its customers mobile handset makers Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics Inc, Xiaomi, Huawei Technologies, Meizu Technology Co and Gionee.\n\n* Ultrahaptics, a UK start-up and spin-off from Bristol University, exploring using inaudible sound waves to create visible shapes and invisible contours in the air, a sort of mid-air haptics.\n\n* Redux Labs, a UK-based company using sonic waves on a surface to create audio or haptic effects.\n\n* Zrro, a crowd-funded start-up developing technology that would enable touch screens to sense fingers up to 3 cm away, allowing users to control devices without touching them.\n\n* Taiwan\u2019s TPK Holding Co Ltd is a major supplier of Apple\u2019s 3D Touch, or Force Touch technology, according to supply chain sources. It provides touch sensors to makers of liquid crystal displays, which are installed inside the phone.\n\n* Vibration motors are then installed during the final stage of product assembly. These motors are crucial in detecting signals from pressure sensors, which activate when a finger touches the screen. According to one industry source, Japan\u2019s Nidec Corp is likely to be the sole supplier of the motors, at least initially.\n\n* Chips and components rest atop flexible printed circuit boards inside the phone. This industry should benefit from the introduction of Force Touch as it requires a new type of circuit board that increases its value per iPhone box, according to the industry. Taiwan\u2019s Zhen Ding Technology Holding Ltd and Japan\u2019s Nippon Mektron Ltd, an unlisted subsidiary of NOK Corp,will supply the majority of the flexible printed circuit boards for the new iPhones, sources said.

        "body": "SINGAPORE/TAIPEI (Reuters) - By adding a more realistic sense of touch to its iPhone, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) may have conquered a technology that has long promised to take us beyond merely feeling the cold glass of our mobile device screens.\n\nIn its latest iPhones, Apple included what it calls 3D Touch, allowing users to interact more intuitively with their devices via a pressure-sensitive screen which mimics the feel and response of real buttons.\n\nIn the long run, the force-sensitive technology also promises new or better applications, from more lifelike games and virtual reality to adding temperature, texture and sound to our screens.\n\n\u201cForce Touch is going to push the envelope of how we interact with our screens,\u201d says Joel Evans, vice president of mobile enablement at Mobiquity, a mobile consultancy.\n\nThe fresh iPhones, unveiled on Wednesday, incorporate a version of the Force Touch technology already in some Apple laptop touchpads and its watches. Apple also announced a stylus that includes pressure sensing technology.\n\nAs with previous forays, from touch screens to fingerprint sensors, Apple isn\u2019t the first with this technology, but by combining some existing innovations with its own, it could leverage its advantage of control over hardware, interface and the developers who could wrap Force Touch into its apps.\n\n\u201cHere we go again. Apple\u2019s done it with gyroscopes, accelerometers, they did it with pressure sensors, they\u2019ve done it with compass, they\u2019ve been great at expediting the adoption of these sensors,\u201d said Ali Foughi, CEO of US-based NextInput, which has its own technology, trademarked ForceTouch. \u201cApple is at the forefront.\u201d\n\nHaptic technology - a tactile response to touching an interface - isn\u2019t new, even in mobile devices. Phones have long vibrated to alert users of incoming calls in silent mode, or when they touch an onscreen button.\n\nBut efforts to go beyond that have been limited.\n\nBlackBerry (BB.TO) incorporated pressure sensing into its Storm phone in 2008. And Rob Lacroix, vice president of engineering at Immersion Corp (IMMR.O), said his company worked in 2012 with Fujitsu (6702.T) on the Raku-Raku Smartphone, an Android phone that could distinguish between a soft and firm touch to help users unfamiliar with handheld devices.\n\nBut most efforts have been hamstrung by either a poor understanding of the user\u2019s needs, or technical limitations. A vibrating buzz, for instance, has negative connotations, causing most people to turn off any vibration feature, says James Lewis, CEO of UK-based Redux, which has been working on similar touch technology for several years.\n\nThe technology powering vibrations is also primitive, he said, meaning there\u2019s a slight delay and a drain on the battery. Early versions of pressure-sensing technology also required a slight gap between screen and enclosure, leaving it vulnerable to the elements.\n\nApple seems to have solved such problems, experts said, judging from their trackpads and the Apple Watch. Indeed, the trackpad carries the same sensation of a physical click of its predecessors, but without the actual pad moving at all.\n\nThe result: In the short term, Force Touch may simply make interacting with a screen more like something we\u2019d touch in real life - a light switch, say, or a physical keyboard. With Force Touch, the device should be able to tell not only whether we are pressing the screen, but how firmly. It should in turn respond with a sensation - not just a vibration, but with a click - even if that click is itself a trick of technology.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to see initially is putting life back into dead display,\u201d said Redux\u2019s Lewis. \u201cWe just got used to the cold feel of glass.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, mobile is not the first industry to flirt with haptics.\n\nFor example, for car drivers, Redux demonstrates a tablet-like display which creates the illusions of bumps and friction when you run your fingers over the glass, mimicking physical buttons and sliders so your eyes don\u2019t need to leave the road.\n\nMobiquity\u2019s technical adviser Robert McCarthy points to several potential uses of Apple\u2019s technology - measuring the force of touch when entering a password, say, to indicate how confident the user is of their selection, or keying in a numeric passcode using different pressure levels as an extra layer of security.\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s adoption of the technology has awoken the mobile industry to its possibilities, it was pipped to the post by Chinese handset maker Huawei [HWT.UL], which this month unveiled one model with what it also tagged Force Touch technology. Pressing harder in a photo app, for example, allows you to zoom in on a picture without the usual two-finger spread.\n\nOther manufacturers are exploring how to make touching a device more friendly, and more advanced, says Freddie Liu, CFO of Taiwan-based TPK Holding Co Ltd (3673.TW), an Apple supplier.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning for Force Touch,\u201d he said."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Journalists and analysts crowded outside a century-old San Francisco arena where Apple Inc is expected to unveil a pair of new iPhones, a larger iPad and an updated Apple TV on Wednesday.\n\nAs lines stretched out across the square that links San Francisco City Hall to the 6,000-seat Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, which is adorned with a big Apple logo, Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue hinted that there would be TV news.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big day for the big screen!\u201d he tweeted, adding a link to the webcast of the event.\n\n\u201cJust a few hours to go here in SF! We can\u2019t wait to show you what we\u2019ve been working on,\u201d CEO Tim Cook tweeted early in the morning.\n\nInvestors also will be scrutinizing Apple\u2019s plans for the next generation of the iPhone, which drove nearly two-thirds of the company\u2019s $49.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter.\n\nApple is widely expected to keep the size of the phones the same but upgrade it with an improved camera and Force Touch, a display technology that responds differently depending on how hard users press their screens.\n\nA year after Apple rolled out iPhones with larger screens, touching off a frenzy of sales that saw revenue in the most recent quarter increase 32.5 percent from the same quarter a year ago, the latest upgrades may leave some investors and consumers underwhelmed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder for Apple to compete against itself,\u201d said analyst Bob O\u2018Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple shares, barely changed in midday trade on Wednesday, are up more than 14 percent over the last year, although they are down nearly 12 percent in the last three months.\n\nFortunately for Apple, most consumers buy smartphones under a two-year upgrade cycle, meaning the company will still likely scoop up a lot of sales, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\n\u201cThe key point of reference is not how the new phone compares to the iPhone 6, it\u2019s how it compares to the iPhone 5s,\u201d he said.\n\nExpectations have been rising for an revamped Apple TV, a set-top box that has seen few significant updates since its release in 2007. Although Apple has yet to hammer out deals for a long-awaited television service, analysts say the company is poised to overhaul the hockey-puck-sized device.\n\nThe device is expected to gain an App Store and an interface that allows users to make requests through the Siri digital assistant and search for specific programs and movies across apps. The company may also discuss the device\u2019s role as a hub for gaming.\n\nNearly 20 percent of U.S. broadband households own at least one streaming media player, and Apple has a long way to go in the market, according to data from research firm Parks Associates.\n\nRoku is the leader in streaming media boxes, accounting for 34 percent of all streaming devices sold in the United States in 2014, according to data from research firm Parks Associates. Google Inc\u2019s Chromecast and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Fire TV were next. The Apple TV box came in fourth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that (Apple) come out and really get up to date and potentially eclipse some of the other living room devices out there,\u201d Moorhead said.\n\nApple is also expected roll out a larger tablet. Amid slumping sales, Apple has tried to push the iPad into the enterprise market, and a gadget with a bigger screen may appeal to some professionals seeking to swap out their laptops for tablets, analysts say.\n\nBut any boost from corporate users will probably not be enough to offset consumers\u2019 waning interest in the device, O\u2019Donnell said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change the arc of the iPad,\u201d he said."
