The company\u2019s market value, or market capitalization, now stands at $506.85 billion.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s move is because of index weightings, with the Nasdaq down because of Apple\u2019s decline,\u201d said Rex Macey, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust in Atlanta. \u201cThe S&P is up because Apple isn\u2019t as big a weight in that index, and the Dow is up even more because it isn\u2019t there at all.\u201d\n\nThe broad market seesawed, with the S&P 500 dropping into negative territory before it rebounded off the 1,400 level, seen as a key support point over the past two weeks.

The S&P financial sector index climbed 1.3 percent, and Bank of America hit a 52-week high of $10.55 before pulling back slightly. The stock, a Dow component, ended at $10.46, up 5.7 percent for the day.\n\nStill, Apple struggled throughout the session. Market participants cited a host of reasons for the drop in the iPad maker\u2019s stock, including a consultant\u2019s report about the company losing share in the tablet market and reports that margin requirements had been raised by at least one clearing firm, as well as year-end tax selling ahead of a possible rise in capital-gains tax rates next year.\n\nOn the Washington front, Obama told the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives, on Wednesday that a fiscal cliff deal was possible \u201cin about a week\u201d if Republicans acknowledged the need to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.\n\nEquities have struggled to gain ground recently because of concerns over the fiscal cliff - a series of mandatory spending cuts and tax increases effective in early January that could push the U.S. economy into recession next year. Recently equities have moved on any whiffs of sentiment from Washington in headlines about negotiations.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s comments generated a lot of optimism, but to the extent the market believes them, that\u2019s how much we\u2019re setting ourselves up for a decline if that deadline passes with no progress,\u201d said Macey, who helps oversee about $20 billion in assets.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC after the market closed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said that uncertainty over the fiscal cliff was standing in the way of stronger economic growth, and that there was no prospect for an agreement if tax rates didn\u2019t rise on the wealthiest taxpayers.\n\nThe stock of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc fell 16 percent to $32.17 and ranked as the S&P 500\u2019s biggest percentage decliner.

Last week, the country and its international lenders reached a deal to lower its debt burden through a debt buyback.\n\nAbout half of the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory, while about 54 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended lower.\n\nVolume was higher than it has been in recent sessions, with about 7.01 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, above the daily average so far this year of about 6.48 billion shares.

The Nasdaq fared worse than the other indexes, weighed by a 4 percent drop in shares of tech heavyweight Apple.\n\n\u201cNothing is going on\u201d in the talks, U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told reporters following a meeting with fellow Republicans. \u201cWe ask the president to sit down with us.\u201d\n\nInvestors are worried that the so-called fiscal cliff of tax hikes and spending reductions that will start to go into effect at the beginning of next year could send the economy back into recession if politicians don\u2019t come to an agreement to avoid it.\n\nObama stuck to his case on Tuesday for raising taxes for wealthier Americans.\n\nThe euro had surged to a seven-week high against the dollar in early trading but went into reverse, falling to $1.3064 as markets digested the disappointing Spanish bond sale.\n\nBond markets also reacted poorly to the auction, with Spanish 10-year yields rising to 5.42 percent after demand for the sale was below expectations.\n\nEuro zone experts still expect Madrid to request a sovereign bailout which would pave the way for the European Central Bank to buy its debt but doubts have started to creep in again following a drop in tensions and yields in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cSpanish yields are trading at quite tight levels so investors may be starting to get scared about whether the current level can be sustained in the near term,\u201d said Alessandro Giansanti, a rate strategist at ING in Amsterdam.\n\n\u201cThis level of yields is implying that the Spanish government will ask for support in the next few months and if it doesn\u2019t happen it\u2019s quite likely that yields will start to move higher.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average slipped 14.90 points, or 0.12 percent, to 12,936.88.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google unit Motorola Mobility is not entitled to ask a court to stop the sale of Apple iPhones and iPads that it says infringe on a patent that is essential to wireless technology, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.\n\nIn June, Judge Richard Posner in Chicago threw out cases that Motorola, now owned by Google, and Apple had filed against each other claiming patent infringement. Both companies appealed.\n\nIn rejecting the Google case, Posner barred the company from seeking to stop iPhone sales because the patent in question was a standard essential patent.\n\nThis means that Motorola Mobility had pledged to license it on fair and reasonable terms to other companies in exchange for having the technology adopted as a wireless industry standard.\n\nStandard essential patents, or SEPs, are treated differently because they are critical to ensuring that devices made by different companies work together.\n\nGoogle appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The FTC said in its court filing that Posner had ruled correctly.\n\nThe commission, which has previously argued against courts banning products because they infringe essential patents, reiterated that position on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cPatent hold-up risks harming competition, innovation, and consumers because it allows a patentee to be rewarded not based on the competitive value of its technology, but based on the infringer\u2019s costs to switch to a non-infringing alternative when an injunction is issued,\u201d the commission wrote in its brief.\n\nThe case is Apple Inc. and NeXT Software Inc. V. Motorola Inc. and Motorola Mobility Inc., in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, no. 2012-1548, 2012-1549."
