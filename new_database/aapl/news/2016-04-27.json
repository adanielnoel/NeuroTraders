        "body": "(Reuters) - The S&P 500 stock index ticked up on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in the energy and materials sectors, even though lackluster economic data weakened the U.S. dollar, thereby giving support to oil and gold prices.\n\nAfter the closing bell, however, S&P500 futures pared gains and Nasdaq added to losses following a more than 6.0 percent fall in Apple\u2019s shares after the company reported earnings below expectations.\n\nEarlier, the U.S. Commerce Department reported U.S. durable goods orders recovered far less than expected in March as demand for cars, computers and appliances slumped, dragging down the U.S. dollar. Consumers also appeared slightly pessimistic on the economy\u2019s short-term outlook and sent a measure of confidence lower in April.\n\nThe data came as Federal Reserve officials started a two-day policy meeting in Washington, D.C. Policymakers are expected to hold interest rates steady but may be more upbeat on the economic outlook, leaving the path open for future interest rate rises.\n\n\u201cCommodities and oil are up, the dollar trending lower, the things that started this rally are still there but there\u2019s a pause on temporary uncertainties,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cTechnical resistance, weaker data, uncertainty about the Fed, weak earnings numbers are giving people pause.\u201d\n\nHe said it is encouraging for market bulls that the S&P500 index is holding near the record high it set almost a year ago after a 15 percent rally from the lows in February.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.08 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,990.32, the S&P 500 gained 3.91 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,091.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.48 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,888.31.\n\nThe S&P 500 has ended little changed since last Thursday, with sector gains and losses hinging on the direction of oil prices each day. The energy sector, up 1.4 percent on Tuesday, posted the session\u2019s biggest gains, tracking a 3.3 percent increase in the price of U.S crude oil futures.\n\nApple shares dropped almost 7.0 percent to $97.31 after the bell as its earnings fell below expectations and its outlook also disappointed. Shares were down 0.7 percent at $104.35 at the end of the regular session.\n\nTwitter shares lost more than 10 percent in late trading after it reported lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter, hurt by weaker spending by big advertisers.\n\nDuring the regular session DuPont rose 2.4 percent to $67.55 as the largest gainer on the Dow industrials after it said it is aiming to buy back $2 billion in shares this year.\n\nDow components 3M and Procter & Gamble were down 1.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively after reporting declining sales.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of 3.4-to-1 and on the Nasdaq a 1.7-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq recorded 60 new highs and 24 new lows.\n\nAbout 6.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared to the 6.9 billion average over the past 20 sessions."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues.\n\nIts shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple\u2019s share buyback and dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors.\n\nApple\u2019s results followed disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and microblog Twitter (TWTR.N) also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations.\n\nApple said it sold 51.2 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down from 61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts\u2019 estimates of about 50 million devices.\n\nWhile Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.\n\nAfter years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple\u2019s exponential growth.\n\n\u201cApple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products. This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth,\u201d said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.\n\nApple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. \u201cThe iPhone 6 is an anomaly,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing, reinforcing wider concerns of saturation.\n\nCook also conceded that the iPhone 6S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the 6. \u201cI don\u2019t mean just a hair lower; it\u2019s a lot lower,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019d had the same rate on 6S as 6, it would be time for a huge party.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales.\n\nCook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come. \u201cThe future of Apple is very bright,\u201d he said. \u201cOur product pipeline has amazing innovations in store.\u201d\n\nEarnings of $1.90 per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $50.56 billion missed expectations of $51.97 billion.\n\nApple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion.\n\nApple also said it was raising its capital return program by $50 billion through a $35 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a 10 percent rise in the quarterly dividend.\n\nIn March, Apple released the iPhone SE, a smaller, 4-inch-screen phone featuring much of the company\u2019s latest technology. Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter, the device is off to a strong start, particularly in emerging markets, Maestri said.\n\n\u201cThe situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,\u201d he said. \u201cThe demand has been very, very strong.\u201d\n\nAlthough Apple\u2019s revenue in Greater China fell 26 percent from the year-ago quarter, Maestri stressed that the company was \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about China. \u201cWe continue to make a lot of investment there,\u201d he said.\n\nCook said that mainland China sales were down only 7 percent in constant currency, attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong, where strength in the local dollar, which is pegged to U.S. currency, deterred tourist shopping.\n\nThe company did not comment on prospects for its iBooks Stores and iTunes Movie service, which were shut down last week in China.\n\nThe drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N).\n\nIn reaction to Apple\u2019s results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), Qorvo (QRVO.O), Broadcom (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday."

Image sensor makers Alps Electric Co Ltd and Mitsumi Electric Co Ltd fell 2.5 percent and 2 percent, respectively, while electronics and optics company Taiyo Yuden Co Ltd was 2.2 percent lower.\n\nPrecision parts maker Minebea Co Ltd slipped 1.8 percent while screen maker Japan Display Inc edged down 0.9 percent and Nitto Denko Corp fell 1.6 percent.\n\nApple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters the company was \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about China, but investors remained wary.\n\n\u201cFollowing the Chinese regulators\u2019 decision to shut down the iBook and iTunes movie store despite previous government approval, Apple and its tech peers must be seriously concerned about the feasibility of Chinese market penetration,\u201d said Martin King, co-managing director at Tyton Capital Advisors.\n\n\u201cCouple this with a slowdown in China, continuing ambivalence towards intellectual property law and a penchant for replicating successful foreign products and you have a large mountain to climb for any tech company banking on Chinese marketshare.\u201d\n\nShares of Mitsubishi Motors Corp were 2.5 percent lower amid media reports that the company\u2019s top two executives are likely to resign over the Japanese automaker\u2019s manipulation of fuel economy data. Its stock has lost more than half its value since closing at 864 yen on April 19, a day before the fuel economy scandal came to light.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s policy decision, due on Thursday, is also a key focus for investors. While many in the central bank are worried about the gloomy economic prospects, they are equally wary of using their diminishing policy tools having just introduced the negative rate policy in January.\n\nCanon Inc tumbled 5.8 percent after a Nikkei business daily report said the company expects sales to decline five percent this year, falling below its own initial estimate.\n\nThe Topix subindex for iron and steel shares was 1 percent lower, weighed down by weak earnings and the prospect of more to come as demand slides at home and abroad.\n\nShares of JFE Holdings Inc were 3.7 percent lower after the steel giant reported declines in sales and operating profit on Tuesday.\n\nThe broader Topix fell 0.7 percent to 1,381.37 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 sat 0.8 percent lower at 12,513.09.

Without that, the FBI could not share it even if it wanted to, sources said.\n\nReuters reported on April 13 that the unnamed contractor had sole ownership of the method it used, making it unlikely that the government could share it.\n\nA day later, the FBI warned Apple of a separate flaw in its iPhone and Mac software, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nIt was the first time the government had alerted Apple to a vulnerability under a White House interagency procedure, known as the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, for reviewing technology security flaws and deciding which ones should be made public, the company said.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s provisional decision means that the unlocking mechanism used on the San Bernardino iPhone will not be referred to the interagency procedure for review.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, FBI Director James Comey said his agency was assessing whether the mechanism would go through the review.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of trying to sort that out,\u201d Comey said.\n\nOfficials have said that the interagency review process leans toward disclosure of technological flaws.
