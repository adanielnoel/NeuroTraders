        "body": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn Technology Group said on Wednesday the company\u2019s flagship Hon Hai unit is finding it difficult to cope with the massive demand for Apple Inc\u2019s iPhones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to make the iPhones. We are falling short of meeting the huge demand,\u201d Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou told reporters after a business forum.\n\nHowever, he declined to comment on brokerage reports saying that the group\u2019s other unit, Foxconn International Holdings (FIH), had taken on some production.\n\nHon Hai Precision Industry, the main listed entity of the parent Foxconn Technology Group, is the key assembler of Apple\u2019s iPhones.\n\nThe group also owns FIH, which traditionally assembles non-Apple products, such as phones from Nokia Oyj and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.\n\nShares of Foxconn International Holdings Ltd (FIH), the world\u2019s biggest contract maker of cellphones, surged as much as 35 percent on Monday after Citigroup upgraded the stock to a \u2018buy\u2019 and said it expected the firm to start assembling iPhones this year.\n\nShares of FIH fell 5.7 percent in Hong Kong on Wednesday, while Hon Hai was up 0.6 percent in Taipei.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple shares could come under further selling pressure and drop to $425 a share over the next year on lack of innovation, said Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer and chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital LP.\n\nGundlach, who recommended betting against Apple in mid-May at the Ira Sohn Investment Conference in New York, told CNBC the company\u2019s stock is \u201coverbelieved\u201d and that its recent debut of the iPad mini is not an innovation.\n\n\u201cThe product innovator, as I\u2019ve said over and over again, isn\u2019t there anymore,\u201d Gundlach said in reference to Apple\u2019s late founder Steve Jobs.\n\nShares of Apple, whose latest quarterly results failed to meet Wall Street\u2019s lofty expectations, has fallen more than 20 percent from a record high of $705.07 in September. Shares slid as much as 4.6 percent on Wednesday to a low of $555.75 before ending the day down 3.8 percent at $558.0019.\n\nWednesday, Apple shares were under pressure as investors grew more uncertain about its ability to fend off unprecedented competition and untangle a snarled iPhone 5 supply chain.\n\nGundlach, whose firm oversees more than $45 billion in assets, said that the stock could fall to around $425 a share.\n\nWith regard to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 2 percent decline on Wednesday, Gundlach said that investors may be anticipating the impact of higher taxes on capital gains that U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to implement.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to think about higher tax rates, maybe you want to sell the stocks before the tax rates go up, and I think that may be pressuring stocks in general,\u201d Gundlach said.\n\nGundlach said that the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d of tax increases and spending cuts set to begin at the start of next year could be \u201cpunted down the road,\u201d but that it could also prove a \u201cmonumental\u201d shock to markets if investors doubt its potential impact.\n\nGundlach also said that his DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund has roughly 15 percent of its assets in cash and that he expects markets to become more volatile.\n\n\u201cI really am looking for higher volatility in the market as a general theme,\u201d he said."
