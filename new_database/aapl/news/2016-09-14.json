        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) said on Tuesday they received strong pre-orders for Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) iPhone 7, sending shares of the world\u2019s most valuable listed company up 3 percent.\n\nSprint said pre-orders were up nearly four times, compared to last year. Pre-orders also rose nearly four times at T-Mobile, compared with its next most popular iPhone.\n\nHowever, the companies did not disclose specific sales numbers. Pre-orders started on Friday.\n\nDetails about sales of the new iPhone are scarce after Apple announced last week it would not release weekend sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand.\n\n\u201cWhile the iPhone 7 update is more revolutionary than evolutionary, we believe investors could consider these strong early pre-order indications as being reflective of the impact of Apple\u2019s significant iPhone installed base expansion over the past few years,\u201d Stifel analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note.\n\nRival carriers AT&T Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) were not immediately available for comment.\n\nApple\u2019s shares were up 2.8 percent at $108.19 in morning trading. Up to Monday\u2019s close, they had fallen 2.1 percent since the iPhone 7 was launched on Wednesday."
