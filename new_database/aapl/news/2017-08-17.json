        "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Ireland\u2019s finance minister said the European Commission\u2019s demand that Dublin collect up to 13 billion euros ($13.8 bln) in back taxes from Apple (AAPL.O) was unjustified, in an interview with Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine (FAZ) newspaper.\n\nThe European Commission ordered Apple to repay taxes to Ireland after ruling last year that the U.S. technology company paid so little tax on its Ireland-based operations that it amounted to state aid.\n\nIn the interview, extracts from which the FAZ published on Wednesday, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the tax rules from which Apple benefited had been available to all and were not tailored for the U.S. technology giant. They did not violate European or Irish law, he added.\n\nThe Irish government has said it will collect the money pending an appeal of the ruling by Apple, but Donohoe said it was not Dublin\u2019s job and the request was not justified.\n\n\u201cWe are not the global tax collector for everybody else,\u201d FAZ quoted him as saying.\n\nThe money is currently being deposited in escrow.\n\nDonohoe also distanced himself from French and German proposals that the EU do more to prevent Chinese investors from buying strategically important European companies, saying this would endanger Europe\u2019s reputation for openness.\n\n\u201cWe must be very careful not to endanger our reputation as advocates for free trade,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also appeared lukewarm on proposals by French President Emmanuel Macron for a euro zone budget and finance minister, saying the bloc\u2019s focus for the next two years should be further developing its banking union."
