        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc told a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday that rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd should be barred from selling products that infringe on its smartphone patents, but the judges were skeptical.\n\nJudge Kimberly Moore was skeptical that Apple was being harmed since it already licenses some technology to other companies. \u201cYou\u2019ve already licensed these patents up the wazoo!\u201d she said.\n\nIn three years of gloves-off patent litigation, Apple and Samsung have battled to a virtual draw. The sole exception was when jurors awarded the iPhone maker about $930 million after a 2012 trial. Samsung is appealing that judgment.\n\nIn the latest round, Apple is seeking an injunction against sales of some Samsung products it says infringe on its patents for technologies such as slide-to-unlock, auto-correct and quick links that can, for instance, send a telephone number from an email to the phone dialer.\n\nApple lawyer William Lee of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hall & Dorr LLP said Samsung could quickly design work-arounds for the patents but did not do so. He told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington that Samsung was harming Apple.\n\nMoore disagreed: \u201cYou\u2019ve licensed them to everyone. So why is it irreparable harm if Samsung uses the patents?\u201d\n\nJudge Sharon Prost said she was \u201chaving a hard time getting past irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nBut on rebuttal, Lee said other smartphone companies, like Google Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], had not licensed the technology.\n\nSamsung lawyer Kathleen Sullivan of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP said the South Korean company had all but stopped using the patents, so no injunction was needed.\n\n\u201cWhy are you fighting it?\u201d said Moore. \u201cWhy am I wasting my time?\u201d\n\nSome industry observers see the dispute as an attempt by Apple to curtail the rapid growth of phones based on Google\u2019s rival Android software. Samsung was by far the largest adopter of the operating platform.\n\nThe case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Apple Inc vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 12-630.\n\nThe case at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics, 14-1802."
