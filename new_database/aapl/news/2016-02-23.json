        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion on Friday seeking to compel Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to comply with a judge\u2019s order to unlock the encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, portraying the tech giant\u2019s refusal as a \u201cmarketing strategy.\u201d\n\nIn response, a senior Apple executive, speaking with reporters on condition of anonymity, characterized the Justice Department\u2019s filing as an effort to argue its case in the media before the company has a chance to respond.\n\nThe back and forth escalated a showdown between the Obama administration and Silicon Valley over security and privacy that ignited earlier this week.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking the tech company\u2019s help to access shooter Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s phone by disabling some of its passcode protections. The company so far has pushed back and on Thursday won three extra days to respond to the order.\n\nAnother senior Apple executive said Congress is the right place for a debate over encryption, not a courtroom.\n\nThe executive said Apple was stunned that such a legal request had come from the U.S. government rather than a country with weaker traditions of protecting privacy and civil liberties.\n\nThe motion to compel Apple to comply did not carry specific penalties for the company, and the Justice Department declined to comment on what recourse it was willing to seek.\n\nIn the order, prosecutors acknowledged that the latest filing was \u201cnot legally necessary\u201d since Apple had not yet responded to the initial order.\n\nThe clash between Apple and the Justice Department has driven straight to the heart of a long-running debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications.\n\nA federal court hearing in California has been scheduled for March 22 in the case, according to Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California.\n\nThe Justice Department said its Friday motion was a response to Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s public statement Wednesday, which included a refusal to \u201chack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack ... Apple has responded by publicly repudiating that order,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the Friday filing.\n\n\u201dApple\u2019s current refusal to comply with the court\u2019s order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nThe two senior Apple executives said the company had worked hard to help investigators and tried multiple avenues including sending engineers with FBI agents to a WiFi network that would recognize the phone and begin an automatic backup if that had been enabled.\n\nThey criticized government officials who reset the Apple identification associated with the phone, which closed off the possibility of recovering information from it through that automatic cloud backup.\n\nSan Bernardino County reset the password on the iCloud account at the request of the FBI, said county spokesman David Wert.\n\nThe government first disclosed the identification change in a footnote to its filing Friday. The Apple executives said that the reset occurred before Apple was consulted. The Justice Department declined to comment on that contention.\n\nThe two sides have been on a collision course since Apple said it would offer strong encryption by default on its devices in 2014, a move prompted in part by the surveillance revelations from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nBut the Justice Department struggled to find a compelling case where encryption proved to be an insurmountable hurdle for its investigators until the Dec. 2 shooting rampage by Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, California, which killed 14. Authorities believe the couple was inspired by the Islamic State.\n\nSome technology experts and privacy advocates backing Apple suggest Farook\u2019s work phone likely contains little data of value. They have accused the Justice Department of choreographing the case to achieve a broader goal of gaining support for legislation or a legal precedent that would force companies to crack their encryption for investigators.\n\nThe case has quickly become a topic in the U.S. presidential race. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on Friday called for a \u201cboycott\u201d against Apple until the company complied with the court order.\n\nThe two Apple executives said they felt in good company, noting that Trump has faulted many other groups and individuals.\n\nThe debate will also play out on Capitol Hill. Bipartisan leaders of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee late Friday invited Apple\u2019s Cook and FBI Director James Comey to testify at an upcoming hearing on encryption, though a date was not set.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is also planning an encryption hearing for March and has invited Apple to attend, according to a congressional source."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Some victims of the San Bernardino attack will file a legal brief in support of the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to force Apple Inc to unlock the encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters, a lawyer representing the victims said on Sunday.\n\nStephen Larson, a former federal judge who is now in private practice, told Reuters that the victims he represents have an interest in the information which goes beyond the Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cThey were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen,\u201d Larson said.\n\nLarson said he was contacted a week ago by the Justice Department and local prosecutors about representing the victims, prior to the dispute becoming public. He said he will file an amicus brief in court by early March.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the matter on Sunday.\n\nLarson declined to say how many victims he represents. Fourteen people died and 22 others were wounded in the shooting attack by a married couple who were inspired by Islamic State militants and died in a gun battle with police.\n\nEntry into the fray by victims gives the federal government a powerful ally in its fight against Apple, which has cast itself as trying to protect public privacy from overreach by the federal government.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment. In a letter to customers last week, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected,\u201d saying that the company has \u201cworked hard to support the government\u2019s efforts to solve this horrible crime.\u201d\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter released on Sunday night that the agency\u2019s request wasn\u2019t about setting legal precedent, but rather seeking justice for the victims and investigating other possible threats.\n\n\u201cFourteen people were slaughtered and many more had their lives and bodies ruined. We owe them a thorough and professional investigation under law. That\u2019s what this is,\u201d Comey wrote.\n\nThe FBI is seeking the tech company\u2019s help to access shooter Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s phone by disabling some of its passcode protections. The company so far has pushed back, arguing that such a move would set a dangerous precedent and threaten customer security.\n\nThe clash between Apple and the Justice Department has driven straight to the heart of a long-running debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications.\n\nThe Justice Department won an order in a Riverside, California federal court on Tuesday against Apple, without the company present in court. Apple is scheduled to file its first legal arguments on Friday, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, who served as a federal prosecutor before being appointed to the bench, has set a hearing on the issue for next month.\n\nLarson once presided over cases in Riverside, and Pym argued cases in Larson\u2019s courtroom several times as a prosecutor while Larson was a judge, he said. Larson returned to private practice in 2009, saying at the time that a judge\u2019s salary was not enough to provide for his seven children.\n\nHe said he is representing the San Bernardino victims for free."

        "body": "PAWLEYS ISLAND, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called on Friday for a boycott of Apple Inc products until the tech company agreed to help the U.S. government unlock the cellphone of one of the killers in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, California, shooting.\n\n\u201dBoycott Apple until such time as they give that information,\u201d Trump said at a campaign event in Pawleys Island, South Carolina. \u201cIt just occurred to me.\u201d\n\nTrump, front-runner for the Republican nomination ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, made the off-the-cuff comment at a town hall-style event at a country club, a day before the state\u2019s nominating contest.\n\nEven as he was still speaking, Trump\u2019s campaign posted on his Twitter handle (@real Donald Trump) from an iPhone, with the timestamp labeled \u201cvia Twitter for iPhone.\u201d\n\nTrump later posted on Twitter that he used both an iPhone and a Samsung device.\n\nIn response, senior Apple executives, on a call with reporters on Friday, said they felt they were in good company given the other groups and people Trump has criticized in the past. They defended encryption as a way to protect Apple customers\u2019 rights.\n\nIt was not the first attack on the world\u2019s best-known technology company by the real estate mogul and reality TV personality. Trump has previously been critical of Apple, which has its headquarters in Cupertino, California, for not producing enough of its products in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,\u201d Trump said in a January speech at Liberty University in Virginia.\n\nApple is resisting U.S. government demands that it unlock an iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party in San Bernardino last December.\n\nTrump made his comments as the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion seeking to force Apple to comply with a judge\u2019s order for the company to unlock the phone, portraying the tech company\u2019s refusal as a \u201cmarketing strategy.\u201d\n\nThe filing increased tension in a showdown between the Obama administration and Silicon Valley over security and privacy. The government has said the couple were sympathizers of Islamic State militants and wants to open the phone to find out more about possible connections and contacts.\n\n\u201cIf Apple doesn\u2019t give the information to the authorities on the radical Islamic terrorists, I\u2019ll only be using a Samsung - until such time as they give the information,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cHopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs and should demand security. It is time to get tough and be smart!\u201d\n\nIt was not the first time Trump has called for a boycott. In November, he lobbied for a Starbucks Corp boycott because the coffee chain\u2019s red holiday cups lacked Christmas-related decorations.\n\nHe has repeatedly urged people not to shop at Macy\u2019s after the department store dropped his signature business clothing line because of comments he made about Mexicans.\n\nThis article was funded in part by SAP.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday urged the creation of a government panel on encryption, the latest salvo in a standoff over a locked iPhone linked to the San Bernardino shooting that has escalated into a public relations battle between the revered technology company and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook also sent a letter to employees Monday morning, making clear the company\u2019s hardline stance refusing to make software to unlock the phone addresses broader issues, not just a single device linked to a grisly attack.\n\n\u201cThis case is about much more than a single phone or a single investigation,\u201d Cook said in the email to employees, seen by Reuters. \u201cAt stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people, and setting a dangerous precedent that threatens everyone\u2019s civil liberties.\u201d\n\nBut FBI Director James Comey, in an article published late Sunday on the national security legal blog Lawfare, asserted the case was not about setting a new legal precedent but rather about \u201cvictims and justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFourteen people were slaughtered and many more had their lives and bodies ruined,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cWe owe them a thorough and professional investigation under law. That\u2019s what this is.\u201d\n\nA federal judge last week ordered Apple to create new software and take others steps to retrieve data from the locked phone, used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters, who was killed in a gun battle with police.\n\nThe company is fighting the order, arguing that creating such a key will jeopardize the security of all iPhones. The company\u2019s formal legal arguments are expected Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s manoeuvres over the past week have prompted Apple supporters to suggest the case is as much about putting political pressure on Apple and influencing the broader policy debate on encryption as it is about getting data from Farook\u2019s phone.\n\nThe Justice Department launched its unusually public campaign to force Apple\u2019s hand by publicizing the court order itself, which normally would have been under seal, according to legal experts. Then, on Friday, the Justice Department filed additional court papers that repeated its legal arguments and criticized the company\u2019s resistance as a \u201cbrand marketing strategy.\u201d The government acknowledged that the Friday filing was \u201cnot legally necessary.\u201d\n\nApple responded hours later by holding a conference call with reporters - a rare move by a generally reticent company that is accustomed to making news rather than reacting to it. That was followed early Monday by a public blog post and an internal email to employees arguing the company\u2019s case.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has actively solicited victims of the shooting to join its case against Apple.\n\nFarook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, destroyed their personal phones before carrying out the Dec. 2 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, which killed 14 and wounded 22. Authorities believe the couple was inspired by the Islamic State. The phone at issue is an iPhone 5c issued to Farook by San Bernardino County in his role as a health inspector.\n\nThe case has revived interest on Capitol Hill in pursuing legislation to address the problem of what law enforcement officials call \u201cgoing dark\u201d - where tight digital security prevents them from accessing the data of criminal suspects.\n\nThe idea of setting up a commission - which may be a prelude to a broader legislative solution - is not new, although a political resolution of the data privacy and encryption debate has proven elusive for many years.\n\nA digital security commission comprising technology, business and law enforcement experts has been proposed by Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, to help break the impasse over encryption.\n\nThe bipartisan pair is scheduled to unveil details of legislation that would create a panel at a Washington event on Wednesday.\n\nApple indicated it would work with a commission or panel of experts to discuss the matter further.\n\n\"Apple would gladly participate in such an effort,\" the company wrote in the Monday post on its website addressing questions about the case.(apple.co/1QthT10)\n\nThe company could not be immediately reached for further comment.\n\nThe Justice Department has pushed back on framing the dispute as an encryption issue, insisting that it is only trying to get past the lock screen on one phone. Apple has argued that while it is technically possible to bypass the security features of the iPhone by building a new operating system, such a move would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nBipartisan leaders of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee late Friday invited Apple\u2019s Cook and FBI Director James Comey to testify at an upcoming hearing on encryption, though no date was set.\n\nSenators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat of the Senate Intelligence Committee respectively, have long said they intend to introduce legislation that would force a company to be able to grant authorities access to a suspect\u2019s data, though a bill has not yet materialized.\n\nSome victims of the attack will file a legal brief in support of the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to force open to unlock the phone, a lawyer representing the victims told Reuters on Sunday."
