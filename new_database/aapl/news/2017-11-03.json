        "body": "* Dow down 0.02 pct, S&P off 0.06 pct, Nasdaq 0.09 pct (Updates to open)\n\nNov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were flat in early trading on Friday after October payrolls data triggered concerns about weak wage growth and drop in labor force participation.\n\nHowever, a 3 percent surge in Apple\u2019s shares provided support after the company\u2019s blowout quarterly results and reports of strong initial demand for its new iPhone X.\n\nApple\u2019s gains helped Dow open at a record level. The stock opened at $174, briefly breaching the $900 billion market capitalization mark.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s closely watched employment report showed U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month.\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 jobs last month but was below economists\u2019 expectations for a rise of 310,000.\n\n\u201cEmployment growth is indeed slowing ... This is basically healthy but certainly we\u2019re moving toward the end of the cycle,\u201d said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial.\n\nUnemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that was because 765,000 people dropped out of the labor force.\n\nAverage hourly earnings slipped by one cent, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms. That lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent, the smallest since February 2016.\n\n\u201c(Wage growth) is worrying. There\u2019s not a lot of good news there. Lower paid workers going back to work after the hurricane would drag it down but you\u2019d expect to see some small wage growth, not flat,\u201d said McMillan.\n\nThe data, however, did little to move the case for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve in December.\n\nAt 9:40 a.m. ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.2 points, or 0.02 percent, at 23,512.06, the S&P 500 was down 1.47 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,578.38.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 6.15 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,721.09.\n\nFive of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by losses in financial index.\n\nIt has been a busy week for market, with President Donald Trump on Thursday tapping Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank and House Republicans disclosing their long-delayed plans for tax cuts.\n\nAIG fell 4.69 percent after the insurer posted a bigger loss on huge catastrophe losses and said it set aside more in reserves.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,480 to 1,079. On the Nasdaq, 1,320 issues fell and 971 advanced. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"

        "body": "NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shoppers surged into Apple Inc stores across the world on Friday to buy the new iPhone X, signaling stronger demand for the 10th anniversary version of the premium smartphone than the last two iterations.\n\nInvestors and analysts took the swell of interest, alongside the company\u2019s better-than-expected sales forecast for the upcoming holiday shopping season, as signs that Apple could be the first ever company worth $1 trillion.\n\nApple\u2019s shares rose 3 percent on Friday, hitting a record high and giving the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company a market capitalization of almost $890 billion.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get to my office and plug it in, back it up and play around with it,\u201d said Jordan Shapiro, a 34-year-old recruiter from New Jersey who was one of the first to get into Apple\u2019s flagship store on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue, at the head of a line that stretched for a block.\n\nJasmine Rivera, a 16-year-old from Las Vegas, said getting one of the new phones was the highlight of her New York trip with her aunt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited and can\u2019t wait to show this to my friends,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.\u201d\n\nThe glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as \u201cthe biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,\u201d starts at $999 in the United States.\n\nThe handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone.\n\nCook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the company\u2019s store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino.\n\nIn nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good, but my socks are wet,\u201d said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night.\n\nSimilar scenes of excitement occurred earlier in the day in Asia and Europe.\n\nIn Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apple\u2019s main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone. Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful bro, what a feeling, I\u2018m excited,\u201d builder Bishoy Behman, 18, told Reuters after picking up two iPhone X as the first in line. He said he camped outside the store for a week before paying to improve his place in the queue overnight.\n\nIn Apple\u2019s Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m going home, and after having a rest, I\u2019d like to have fun (with the phone),\u201d said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue.\n\nIn Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.\n\nArbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand. In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased.\n\nNewly purchased iPhone X were reselling for HK$11,800 ($1,512) soon after sales began, but the price quickly fell to HK$10,300, a trader told Reuters. In mainland China - where Hong Kong traders often sell newly purchased goods - the anniversary model\u2019s starting price is 8,388 yuan ($1,267).\n\nAnalysts had expressed concern that supply issues might stop Apple satisfying early demand. The camera, for instance, has never before been manufactured in the volume Apple demands.\n\nBut Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was \u201cquite happy\u201d with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.\n\n\u201cProduction is growing every week, and that\u2019s very, very important during a ramp period,\u201d he said.\n\nDemand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple\u2019s online store. While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks.\n\nThe rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.\n\nWall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apple\u2019s market value past $1 trillion.\n\nFriday\u2019s lines signaled the company was \u201con track for a pretty good replacement cycle\u201d said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\n\u201cWe do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for,\u201d said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings and offered a rosy forecast for the holiday shopping season, allaying investor concerns about production delays on the new iPhone X and demonstrating remarkable strength across its growing line of products and services.\n\nThe stellar earnings report came just as the iPhone X went on sale Friday morning in Australia. Long lines were forming at Apple stores around the world, recalling the consumer frenzy that greeted early versions of the iPhone, but had faded with more recent launches.\n\nWith supplies potentially tight, some Australian purchasers were already planning to sell their phones for as much as A$3,000, nearly double the A$1,579 selling price.\n\nApple shares rose 4 percent in after-hours trading to hit an all-time high, with analysts lavishing praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook and speculating on when Apple might become the first public company worth a trillion dollars.\n\nThe earnings demonstrate how Apple is able to drive growth across an ever-expanding product line that now includes five different iPhone models along with the iPad, the Mac, the Apple Watch and a suite of fast-growing services offerings.\n\n\u201cWe had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones,\u201d Cook said on a call with analysts. \u201cWe tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone, but may have a more limited budget.\u201d\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Apple appeared to be facing a rare stumble with a delay in the iPhone X launch and rumors of production problems that could limit supply.\n\nBut Apple executives on Thursday shrugged off the concerns as Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters the company was \u201cquite happy\u201d with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.\n\nAnalysts have been eager to see whether Apple can meet demand for the iPhone X during the crucial holiday quarter, with most saying it will likely take it until next year or early spring to do so.\n\n\u201cWhere the demand curve and supply curve are going to intersect, we do not know. It does not have a predecessor product,\u201d Maestri told Reuters.\n\nApple forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion, at the high end of analysts average expectations of $84.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\n\u201cA trillion-dollar market cap may now be in Cook\u2019s sights in light of these results and guidance around iPhone X,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, referring to Apple\u2019s chief executive.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s market capitalization of about $868 billion already makes it the world\u2019s most valuable publicly-traded company.\n\nThere are still questions around supplies of the new phone and longer-term demand.\n\nBob O\u2018Donnell, head of Techanalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple is not able to fill demand for iPhone X over the holiday quarter, it would push buyers to wait until Apple\u2019s March quarter, by which time they may have spent their money elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is, how long will this first group of (iPhone X buyers) last?\u201d O\u2018Donnell said.\n\nApple said it sold 46.7 million iPhones in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, above analysts\u2019 estimates of 46.4 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. However, average selling prices of $618 fell short of forecasts of $638.\n\nThe company\u2019s net income rose to $10.71 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the quarter, from $9.01 billion, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier. That beat the average analyst estimate of $1.87 per share.\n\nApple forecast a gross margin of 38 percent to 38.5 percent, higher than many analysts expected because new products often have higher costs.\n\nMaestri attributed the margin strength to Apple\u2019s growing services business, which brought in $8.5 billion in revenue compared to analyst estimates of $7.5 billion. That included a favorable $640 million adjustment, though Apple officials did not elaborate.\n\nThe $28.85 billion revenue from iPhone sales accounted for nearly 55 percent of total revenue, which rose 12.2 percent to $52.58 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting total revenue of $50.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nApple also said it returned to revenue growth in China, bringing in $9.8 billion compared with $8 billion a year ago, driven by double-digit unit sale increases of the iPhone. Maestri also told Reuters the company had doubled its revenue in India during the fiscal fourth quarter, though he did not give any details."
