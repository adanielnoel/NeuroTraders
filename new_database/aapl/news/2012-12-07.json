        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 advanced modestly on Friday, though another sell-off in Apple depressed technology shares and kept the Nasdaq negative, overshadowing a sharply better-than-expected jobs report.\n\nTrading was light, continuing the week\u2019s trend of slight moves and anemic volume. The S&P 500 ended up a mere 0.1 percent for the week, following several volatile sessions that repeatedly pushed it in and out of positive territory. The benchmark index is just 3.8 percent below the 2012 intraday high of 1,474.51 reached in mid-September.\n\nEquities opened higher after the non-farm payrolls report, which showed 146,000 jobs added in November, far more than had been expected, while the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent. A sour reading on consumer sentiment caused an erosion of those gains, though markets rebounded going into the close.\n\nThe Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index for early December fell to its lowest level since August. Sentiment fell on growing concerns over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d debates in Washington, which have been a major factor preventing broader moves as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not as concerned as we were a few months ago because of improvement like you can see in the employment number, but there\u2019s such a wild card over the cliff,\u201d said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cThere are such concerns about what could happen that markets will be overhung until a resolution is more certain.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest drags on the Nasdaq was Apple (AAPL.O) which fell 2.6 percent to $533.25, extending its losses for the week to 8.9 percent. This was the worst week for the stock since May 2010, and with the losses, the stock of the largest U.S. company by market value is now down 24.4 percent from an all-time intraday high reached in late September.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s session, Apple\u2019s 50-day moving average fell to $599.52 - below its 200-day moving average at $601.38. The weakness drove the S&P information technology sector .GSPT lower. The index fell 0.6 percent and was the weakest of the S&P 500\u2019s 10 major industry sectors on Friday.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 81.09 points, or 0.62 percent, to 13,155.13 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 4.13 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,418.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC slipped 11.23 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 2,978.04.\n\nFor the week, the Nasdaq is down 1.1 percent, hurt largely by the decline in Apple.\n\nThe Dow, which does not count Apple as a component, rose 1 percent for its third straight week of gains. The S&P 500 is also up for three straight weeks, rising 4.3 percent over that period.\n\nThe equity market has regained most of the ground it lost following President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election as markets turned their focus to the coming \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d Market response to the macroeconomic data remained muted as negotiations continued to command investor attention.\n\nU.S. House Speaker John Boehner said that talks this week with President Barack Obama produced no progress, and he renewed his demand that the president provide a new offer to avert the series of tax increases and spending cuts that are likely to hurt economic demand in 2013.\n\nMaterial shares .GSPM were the strongest performers of the day, with that index up 0.8 percent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Co (FCX.N) gained 2.9 percent to $31.70 while Dow Chemical DOW.N added 2.2 percent to $30.30.\n\nAmarin Corp (AMRN.O) fell 18.9 percent to $9.69 after the biopharmaceutical company raised $100 million in financing to help it launch its heart drug, Vascepa, but disappointed investors, who had hoped for a sale or partnership.\n\nCombiMatrix Corp (CBMX.O) shares more than quadrupled, soaring 336.6 percent to $8.60 after the company said two studies published in a medical journal favored technology it uses for prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities over traditional technologies.\n\nAbout 52 percent of shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher while slightly more than 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed stocks closed lower.\n\nVolume was light, with about 5.47 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.48 billion shares."

The Xiaomi phone 2 has specifications similar to those of Samsung Electronics\u2019 Galaxy S3 and Apple\u2019s iPhone5 but a top-of-the-line model sells for about $370, half the price of an iPhone5.\n\nUnlike the big domestic smartphone players, such as Lenovo Group, ZTE Corp and Huawei Technologies, which work with telecom carriers to sell a large volume of smartphones, Xiaomi sells most of its phones online and in small batches.\n\nThis small volume strategy creates pent-up demand that gives Xiaomi free marketing buzz. The first batch of 50,000 phones released on October 30 sold out in less than two minutes. Subsequent larger batches have also sold out in minutes.\n\nLei, who has nearly 4 million followers on China\u2019s popular microblogging platform, Weibo, feeds the buzz by dangling teasers about new products and launch dates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a company that chases sales volume. We chase customer satisfaction. We look for ways to give the customer a great surprise,\u201d Lei said.\n\nHis vision for an exclusive mid-tier brand that builds up incrementally, rather than swamping the market, has found financial backers. In June, Xiaomi raised $216 million from Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp, and a few of Lei\u2019s friends, local media reported, giving it a valuation of $4 billion.\n\n\u201cChina is ripe for its own Apple, HTC or Samsung,\u201d said Hans Tung, managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, a venture firm backing Xiaomi. \u201cThe country is big enough, there are enough mobile Internet users and mobile phone consumers. Therefore having its own mobile ecosystem built up by a domestic brand makes sense.\u201d\n\nXiaomi, which was founded in April 2010 and only started selling smartphones in October 2011, is on track to sell 7 million units this year, exceeding its target of 2 million.\n\nXiaomi is already profitable and is expected to rake in sales of up to 13 billion yuan ($2 billion) this year.\n\n\u201cOur product only sold for a year and hit sales of $2 billion. That is pretty impressive,\u201d Lei said, adding Xiaomi was not considering an initial public offering within the next five years.\n\nTung said Xiaomi\u2019s net margins were 10 percent. This suggests its net profit could hit $200 million this year.\n\nMo Xiaohua, a 24-year-old accountant, is a proud Xiaomi fan who only recently bought her first Xiaomi phone. For many who use Xiaomi phones, the customizable themes and the weekly updates are a big draw.\n\n\u201cI like Xiaomi because among China\u2019s brand smartphones, its value is the best,\u201d Mo said. \u201cNow that we have such a good China branded phone, we need to support it.\u201d\n\nXiaomi has its fair share of detractors who doubt it will have a happy ending. They say the smartphone game in China can only be won with wide distribution and high volume or a big brand with distinctive designs.\n\nXiaomi, whose attraction is its price and high technical specifications, does not win points for cutting-edge design.\n\n\u201cThis is a world where people are now cranking out \u2018black back flats\u2019, that\u2019s what all these phones are when you put 10 on the table...

However, the gains faded, and selling increased after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index for early December fell to its lowest level since August.\n\nApple shares resumed a recent slide, falling 2.9 percent to $531.27. The stock of Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, is down 10 percent this week. It has dropped 24 percent from its all-time intraday high of $705.07 reached in late September.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s session, Apple\u2019s 50-day moving average fell to $599.52 - below its 200-day moving average at $601.38 - and putting the stock on track for its worst week since May 2010.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of contributing factors to the weakness today. One is the return to the negative slide in Apple. It\u2019s a pretty big proxy for tech in general, and the market overall,\u201d said Michael James, senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s session, Apple\u2019s 50-day moving average fell to $599.52 - below its 200-day moving average at $601.38 - and putting the stock on track for its worst week since May 2010.\n\nApple\u2019s weakness drove the S&P information technology sector lower. The index fell 0.7 percent and was the weakest of the S&P 500\u2019s 10 major industry sectors on Friday.\n\nThe equity market has regained most of the ground it lost following President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election as markets turned their focus to the coming \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d Market response to the macroeconomic data remained muted as negotiations continued to command investor attention.\n\nThe conflicting reports \u201cwould have had more of a lasting effect in a normal environment, but in the current environment? No. There\u2019s total uncertainty with what\u2019s going to transpire here and abroad. Too many questions,\u201d said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia.\n\nU.S. House Speaker John Boehner said that talks this week with President Barack Obama produced no progress, and he renewed his demand that the president provide a new offer to avert the series of tax increases and spending cuts that are likely to hurt economic demand in 2013.\n\nStill, the S&P 500 is just 4.1 percent below the 2012 intraday high of 1,474.51 reached in mid-September.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 53.67 points, or 0.41 percent, to 13,127.71. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index gained 1.80 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,415.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 15.55 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,973.72.\n\nAmarin Corp shares lost 18.5 percent to $9.74 after the biopharmaceutical company raised $100 million in financing to help it launch its heart drug, Vascepa, but disappointed investors, who had hoped for a sale or partnership.\n\nCombiMatrix Corp shares soared 250.3 percent to $6.90 after the company said two studies published in a medical journal favored technology it uses for prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities over traditional technologies.\n\nShares of Netflix Inc, which had fluctuated between positive and negative territory earlier in the session, turned higher once more by early afternoon. Netflix was up 0.6 percent at $86.66 following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission was considering taking action against the company and its Chief Executive Reed Hastings for violating public disclosure rules with a Facebook post.
