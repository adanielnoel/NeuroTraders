        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Wednesday it did not own the rights to the technical method a contractor used to open an Apple iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters and therefore could not submit details of the mechanism for an interagency government review.\n\nAmy S. Hess, the FBI\u2019s executive assistant director for science and technology, said in a statement that when it hired an outside party to unlock the phone, the agency did not purchase the rights to the technique.\n\nAs a result, Hess said, the FBI does not \u201chave enough technical information about any vulnerability\u201d in the iPhone to submit for the interagency review.\n\nIf an interagency review, conducted in secret, had been initiated, it would have decided whether the vulnerability could be disclosed to government agencies or the private sector.\n\nThe iPhone in question was owned by the San Bernardino County Health Department and assigned to employee Syed Farook, who, with his wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people and wounded 22 during an attack on his co-workers last December.\n\nWhile officials have not identified the contractor who provided the technique for opening the shooter\u2019s phone, a law enforcement official said that the FBI can re-use the unlocking mechanism on other phones, provided it works on those phones.\n\nHess said the FBI usually does not comment on vulnerabilities found in cyber products, but the agency decided to make a statement because of the \u201cextraordinary nature of this particular case, the intense public interest in it, and the fact that the FBI already has disclosed publicly the existence of the method.\u201d\n\nHess\u2019 statement confirmed information from U.S. government sources on Tuesday that the FBI had provisionally decided not to share the iPhone unlocking mechanism because the agency did not own it."

        "body": "SYDNEY, April 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc expanded its Apple Pay digital wallet in Australia on Thursday after ANZ became the country\u2019s first bank to support the mobile payment service, executives at the pair told Reuters.\n\nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year with American Express Co.\n\nThe latest partnership extends the service to ANZ customers and represents the culmination of months of talks with the bank and three bigger peers. Of the four, ANZ and Westpac Banking Corp have already agreed to support rival Android Pay from Alphabet Inc unit Google.\n\nCollectively, the four account for 80 percent of all credit cards that consumers have linked to mobile payment systems, in a country with a relatively high rate of contactless payment.\n\nThe partnership also coincides with Apple\u2019s first-ever drop in iPhone sales during a quarter in which services such as apps, music and payment emerged as the firm\u2019s second-largest business.\n\n\u201cOur customers ... are much closer to being able to leave their wallets at home,\u201d Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said in an interview.\n\nApple has partnered with a bank widely seen as trailing its three bigger peers in digital technology, a situation ANZ\u2019s new Chief Executive Shayne Elliott has set out to change with Apple Pay, as well as by hiring Google\u2019s Australia managing director.\n\n\u201cIt would be pretty hypocritical of me to ... do all this hoo-ha about digital banking and then not be at the forefront of change,\u201d Elliott said in an interview.\n\nDigital technology such as Apple Pay is making inroads in the financial industry, prompting traditional banks such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac, National Australia Bank Ltd and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) to beef up digital services.\n\nOver a quarter of banking revenue, or about A$27 billion ($20.82 billion), is at risk from \u201cdigital disruptors\u201d, consultancy KPMG recently estimated.\n\nApple has introduced Apple Pay to countries such as the United States and Britain where banks were also reluctant to sign up. It has since launched in China in February and in Singapore last week.\n\nApple continues to speak with other Australian banks, Bailey said, hoping ANZ customers\u2019 experience will create demand among competitors.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues.\n\nIts shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple\u2019s share buyback and dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors.\n\nApple\u2019s results followed disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and microblog Twitter (TWTR.N) also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations.\n\nApple said it sold 51.2 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down from 61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts\u2019 estimates of about 50 million devices.\n\nWhile Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.\n\nAfter years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple\u2019s exponential growth.\n\n\u201cApple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products. This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth,\u201d said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.\n\nApple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. \u201cThe iPhone 6 is an anomaly,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing, reinforcing wider concerns of saturation.\n\nCook also conceded that the iPhone 6S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the 6. \u201cI don\u2019t mean just a hair lower; it\u2019s a lot lower,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019d had the same rate on 6S as 6, it would be time for a huge party.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales.\n\nCook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come. \u201cThe future of Apple is very bright,\u201d he said. \u201cOur product pipeline has amazing innovations in store.\u201d\n\nEarnings of $1.90 per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $50.56 billion missed expectations of $51.97 billion.\n\nApple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion.\n\nApple also said it was raising its capital return program by $50 billion through a $35 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a 10 percent rise in the quarterly dividend.\n\nIn March, Apple released the iPhone SE, a smaller, 4-inch-screen phone featuring much of the company\u2019s latest technology. Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter, the device is off to a strong start, particularly in emerging markets, Maestri said.\n\n\u201cThe situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,\u201d he said. \u201cThe demand has been very, very strong.\u201d\n\nAlthough Apple\u2019s revenue in Greater China fell 26 percent from the year-ago quarter, Maestri stressed that the company was \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about China. \u201cWe continue to make a lot of investment there,\u201d he said.\n\nCook said that mainland China sales were down only 7 percent in constant currency, attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong, where strength in the local dollar, which is pegged to U.S. currency, deterred tourist shopping.\n\nThe company did not comment on prospects for its iBooks Stores and iTunes Movie service, which were shut down last week in China.\n\nThe drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N).\n\nIn reaction to Apple\u2019s results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), Qorvo (QRVO.O), Broadcom (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Apple (AAPL.O) could cash in the value it lost in the first minute of trading on Wednesday, it would be nearly enough to buy General Motors, Target or Caterpillar.\n\nIn fact, the $48 billion-or-so the iPhone maker\u2019s stock shed at its session low could buy any one of nearly 400 components of the S&P 500. Various measures of valuation suggest the stock is probably still cheap - and has been for some time - but that may not motivate buyers concerned shares may fall further on saturation in iPhone sales.\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised in the near term for the stock to fall to the high $80s or low $90s, there\u2019s no catalyst right now,\u201d said Channing Smith, managing director at Capital Advisors in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The firm manages about $1.4 billion in assets and Apple accounts for roughly 4 percent of their holdings, he said.\n\nApple shares were recently down 6.3 percent at $97.81.\n\nAt its session low of $95.68, Apple was almost 40 percent below its intrinsic valuation of $153 per share according to StarMine, which projects prices based on earnings per share growth five years forward. That number will likely fall following Tuesday\u2019s earnings miss and reduced expectations.\n\nEven compared to the median target price of 46 analysts, currently $121, the stock trades at a discount of almost 20 percent.\n\nApple\u2019s 12-month forward price to earnings ratio stands at 11.1 compared with an average of 17.5 over the past 10 years -roughly the life span of the iPhone - according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.\n\nThe stock\u2019s price momentum as measured by the Thomson Reuters Eikon model, which weighs long-, medium- and short-term price movements, is the lowest since October 2013.\n\n\u201cThe stock is likely going to struggle in the coming months but Apple is not going away,\u201d said Capital Advisors\u2019 Smith. \u201cIt is a good risk-reward stock in an otherwise expensive market.\u201d\n\nInvestors are paying 17 times for S&P 500 forward earnings, making the 11.1 times they pay for Apple the widest gap in more than 15 years, according to Datastream.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the stock could see a short term rebound, as a measure of its internal relative strength indicates shares are oversold.\n\nGene Munster, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray, said he doubts Apple stock will fall further, predicting the anticipated launch of the iPhone 7 will return the company to growth in the fall.\n\n\u201cThings are going to be more optimistic in the future, and the irony of this whole collapse is that it creates an easier comparable for the future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dIt basically is resetting the bar to make the story, at least for investors, more attractive."

And executives have cheered the progress they are making in subscriptions, touting Apple Music\u2019s 13 million paying subscribers.\n\nThe size of Apple\u2019s installed base with 1 billion devices in consumer hands suggests it has plenty of room to grow in services. Services also promise a recurring revenue stream, unlike hardware sales.\n\nBut analysts say Apple faces an uphill battle in carving out the same sort of position in services that it has achieved with its hardware. The $6 billion in services revenue also pales in comparison to iPhone sales which accounted for about two-thirds of the company\u2019s $50.6 billion quarterly sales.\n\nFirms such as music service Spotify, cloud storage rivals Google and Microsoft Corp and map makers have claimed major audiences among iPhone users, even when Apple has offered its own products as a default.\n\nAlso raising the stakes for its services business has been Apple\u2019s decision to release in March the smaller, much cheaper iPhone SE - a move that is seen as trading revenue per device for broader adoption of its phones.\n\n\u201cFor the strategy to really make a lot of sense, you want to be more aggressive in building that services revenue,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners.\n\nApple may also have to speed up its game.\n\n\u201cApple has settled into this annual upgrade cycle for hardware and software,\u201d said analyst Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research. \u201cThat\u2019s quite different than the way that say Facebook pushes out updates to its app or Google makes changes to its search engine - they do that almost in real time.\u201d\n\nGillis at BGC Partners calculates that margins for Apple\u2019s services businesses are not as strong as the iPhone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any one is ever going to find that kind of sweet spot,\u201d he said.\n\nApple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on Tuesday services achieve a similar level of profitability for the company as the average of its other businesses.\n\nPushing ahead in services in China - Apple\u2019s second largest market - may also be challenging due to regulatory concerns. Chinese regulators have demanded that Apple halt its sales of books and movies in the country, the New York Times reported last week.\n\n\u201cThey need (services) in China - it has to be part of the growth story,\u201d said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Ask Siri if iPhone 7 will be the answer to Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) problems, and you\u2019re told that a visit to Apple\u2019s website should answer that question \u201cand more\u201d.\n\nIf only it was that easy.\n\nApple\u2019s shares closed down 6.3 percent at $97.82 on Wednesday, wiping off about $36 billion in market value, a day after the company reported its first-ever fall in smartphone sales, arousing talk of \u201cpeak iPhone\u201d.\n\nFor many analysts, the company\u2019s immediate future rests with iPhone 7, which Apple is expected to launch in September.\n\n\u201cIf iPhone 7 doesn\u2019t surprise with meaningful new useful features, we worry that consumers won\u2019t upgrade,\u201d Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cAnd unfortunately, nothing that we\u2019ve seen about iPhone 7 thus far strikes us as particularly innovative,\u201d said Schachter, who cut his price target to $112 from $117 while maintaining his \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the stock.\n\nThe iPhone 7 is expected to sport a new look with features such as waterproofing, wireless headphones and force touch as the home button.\n\nBut many wonder if that will be enough to entice users to dump their existing iPhones or switch from the Android-based phones that have come to dominate the smartphone market.\n\nGoldman Sachs removed Apple from its conviction list after Apple\u2019s results and said it expected the company\u2019s shares to remain weak until the market gets more comfortable with the prospects for iPhone 7.\n\nGoldman was among at least 16 brokerages that cut price outlooks on Apple\u2019s stock, cutting its target to $136 from $155 while retaining a \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\n\nOf the 46 analysts covering the stock, 36 rate it \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy\u201d or the equivalent. The median price target is $121, according to Reuters data.\n\nApple usually launches new iPhones in September and sells the most devices in the December quarter.\n\nUnit sales typically drop over the next few quarters, picking up after the next iPhone launch.\n\nAlong with the weaker-than-expected iPhone sales, Apple reported its first drop in revenue in a decade. Sales in China, the company\u2019s most important market after the United States, fell 26 percent.\n\nApple also forecast another disappointing quarter for sales.\n\nThe bad news overshadowed strong results from the company\u2019s growing service business and an increase in share buybacks.\n\nAs of Wednesday\u2019s close, nearly $200 billion has been wiped off the value of the world\u2019s most valuable listed company over the past year - almost the equivalent of the market cap of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world\u2019s biggest retailer. The stock last closed below $100 in February.\n\nApple\u2019s disappointing results fit a recent pattern for tech companies. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) came up short of expectations.\n\nPiper Jaffray\u2019s Gene Munster said that while there were few bright spots in Apple\u2019s report, he believed Apple\u2019s shares would rebound in 2016 as iPhone sales start to grow again in the fourth quarter.\n\nStill, there was a bigger question about the iPhone\u2019s longer-term growth and other factors that can drive revenue, he wrote. \u201cThat question remains unanswered after the March report.\u201d"

        "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - After announcing its first-ever drop in iPhone sales on Tuesday, Apple Inc sought to reassure investors by saying its latest and cheapest model was in strong demand after being launched in late March. Some retailers and suppliers in Asia aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nIn a Reuters survey of 10 retailers in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, seven - including four Apple Stores - reported solid early demand, but three third-party retailers said sales were weak. Two suppliers of components for Apple phones, including the new iPhone SE, said they were seeing lower orders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with iPhones for five to six years now. This current quarter for Apple feels weak,\u201d said an executive at a Taiwan-based company whose components are used in iPhones including the SE model, which markets for $399. \u201cOur current shipment situation for Apple is not like the last two years. There are more iPhone models, but the total volume of iPhones is falling.\u201d\n\nSuch a mixed outlook from Greater China, its most important market after the United States and generator of a quarter of the company\u2019s revenue, could be a major cause of concern for Apple.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue from the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 26 percent in the March quarter, making it the weakest region in the world.\n\nApple did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters survey.\n\n\u201ciPhone is still popular but sales have dropped because... there\u2019s no new model and the SE is similar to 5C. So it doesn\u2019t sell well,\u201d said Zhu You Peng, a salesman at Apple product reseller Xiongyu in Shenzhen. The 5C was Apple\u2019s last attempt to produce a cheaper phone, back in 2013.\n\nZhu said it sold around 300 iPhones per month last year but the number has dropped to around 100-200 this year.\n\nThat view contrasts with upbeat comments about the phone from Apple\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,\u201d he told Reuters, referring to the iPhone SE. \u201cThe demand has been very, very strong.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone SEs are sold out in Apple\u2019s own stores in mainland China and customers have to wait about three weeks to get the product delivered by Apple, according to Apple\u2019s websites. The size of the original supplies to the stores is unclear.\n\nApple, whose shares dropped about 8 percent after it reported the disappointing first-quarter results on Tuesday, is under pressure to show that the decline in iPhone sales represents just a hiccup, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the only challenge facing the U.S. technology giant. Its mobile entertainment services were blocked online in China earlier this month just at a time when it wants to grow services business as potential source of revenue against tapering iPhone sales. The New York Times reported that a state regulator had demanded Apple halt the services.\n\nThe new phone was seen as an important offsetting influence in subsequent periods until Apple launches its iPhone 7 - widely expected around September. The lower price point was part of a strategy to compete against Asian rivals in emerging markets such as China.\n\nAt the iPhone SE product launch in March, Apple vice president of iPhone Product Marketing Greg Joswiak singled out China as a target market, saying four-inch displays like that on the iPhone SE were still popular with first-time smartphone buyers. Apple\u2019s mainstream iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens.\n\nAnother supplier said iPhone orders will be lower in the second quarter and second half of this year. It also provides a component for the SE model.\n\n\u201cOur customer is aiming for a higher target, but we are more conservative on that,\u201d the person said, referring to Apple.\n\nThat adds to concern that Apple may further lose momentum in China, where slowing economic growth may prompt more consumers to snap up cheaper phones.\n\n\u201cLocal brands are taking up more sales, especially among low income people who earn less than 3,000 yuan a month. OPPO, Vivo phones that cost around 1,000-2,000 yuan sells the best among them,\u201d said Zhu at Xiongyu.\n\nAided by strong market share gain in China, Chinese smartphone vendors shipped more smartphones globally than Apple and Samsung Electronics Co combined had supplied for the first time in the first quarter, according to research firm TrendForce.\n\nUnderscoring the surging growth for Chinese vendors, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, third-largest after Samsung and Apple, reported earlier this month a 62 percent growth in global smartphone shipments in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cConsumers who want to show they are rich enough, they will buy an iPhone... those who want to use something different, they will choose Samsung,\u201d Joonsuh Kim, chief design officer of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, told Reuters, referring to consumers in China.\n\n\u201cBut these days consumers are not that old fashioned. They are getting much smarter, and this is why we have much chance,\u201d said the former Samsung mobile design director."

The index rose half a percent led by 1.5 percent gains on Saudi Basic Industries .\n\nRussia\u2019s rouble-denominated equity index and the rouble were flat on the day .\n\nCosta said the market remained wary of pushing the rouble higher, given its 30 percent rally in the past three months and before Friday\u2019s central bank meeting. The meeting should leave rates unchanged but could signal easing in coming months.\n\nThe Hungarian forint slipped a quarter percent to the euro after Tuesday\u2019s expected 15 basis-point (bps) rate cut, trading just off two-week lows. Hungarian short-dated bond yields hit new record lows after the cut.\n\nThe zloty resumed its fall, losing 0.4 percent to the euro on fears Poland\u2019s plans for Swiss franc mortgage conversions will lead to ratings downgrades.\n\nEarlier, Malaysian shares hit two-month lows as the crisis around state fund 1MBD continued. But default fears have been contained as Abu Dhabi-backed IPIC is paying a missed coupon on a bond that it guarantees.\n\nThe Brazilian real was marginally firmer before a central bank meeting that should hold rates steady.
