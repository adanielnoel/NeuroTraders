        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Android and Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company\u2019s operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world\u2019s biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is making a major play to win back developers,\u201d said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \u201cThey\u2019ve opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft\u2019s developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nThe apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft\u2019s online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft\u2019s services such as Bing maps, rather than Google\u2019s services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft\u2019s developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia\u2019s handset business last year, has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung (005930.KS), control 81 percent of the market and Apple 15 percent, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones. It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said."
