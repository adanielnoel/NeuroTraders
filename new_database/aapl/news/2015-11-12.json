        "body": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland does not expect European Union regulators to issue a decision on the country\u2019s tax deal with Apple until after Christmas, the finance minister said on Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday, Noonan had said that a decision was expected before Christmas. But on Tuesday the Irish government got \u201csome low level information that it probably wouldn\u2019t come until after Christmas,\u201d Noonan said.\n\nNoonan, who has expressed confidence in the past that Ireland would be cleared of any wrongdoing, said the government did \u201cnot have a straight read\u201d of what the ruling would be, adding that he did not want to be seen as prejudicing the decision."
