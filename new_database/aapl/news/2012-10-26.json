        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc delivered a second straight quarter of disappointing results and iPad sales fell well short of Wall Street\u2019s targets, marring its record of consistently blowing past investors\u2019 expectations.\n\nShares in the world\u2019s most valuable technology company briefly dipped to levels not seen since the start of August, after it delivered a 27 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue and a 24 percent increase in earnings.\n\nThe numbers, while in line with expectations, lacked the positive surprises that investors have grown used to, and came after Apple undershot revenue targets in the previous quarter. Its shares bounced back after CEO Tim Cook told analysts on a conference call that the latest iPhone 5 was heavily backlogged but the company had mostly worked out kinks in its supply chain.\n\nApple shipped 26.9 million iPhones in the last quarter, just ahead of analysts\u2019 predictions, but iPad sales of 14 million were well below lowered forecasts for the tablet as the economy remained weak and consumers awaited the iPad mini, which will hit store shelves next month. South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co sold 56.3 million smartphones in the quarter, according to research firm IDC, giving it 31.3 percent global market share, more than double that of Apple.\n\nAnalysts say the real test for Apple will come during the crucial year-end holiday shopping season, when competition will reach fever-pitch against new gadgets from Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cGoing into earnings we were wondering if the slowing economy will catch up with Wall Street, and it has,\u201d said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund.\n\n\u201cApple is very well positioned with the iPad and now the iPad mini. It has a great smartphone and we expect the iPhone 5 to sell very well. The outlook is conservative, but that\u2019s not surprising. Err on the side of caution is a proven formula.\u201d\n\nApple heads into the current quarter after refreshing almost all of its product lines, including introducing an upgraded, fourth-generation full-sized iPad. The December quarter will show how well consumers respond to its latest gamble - the iPad mini - which goes on sale on November 2.\n\nQuarterly revenue in China, Apple\u2019s second-largest market, rose 26 percent, and jumped nearly 80 percent to $23.8 billion over the full year, contributing 15 percent of Apple\u2019s total, Cook told analysts. Apple plans to launch the iPhone 5 in China in December, hoping to staunch market share loss in what is set to become the world\u2019s largest smartphone market this year.\n\nApple\u2019s China smartphone market share almost halved to 10 percent in April-June as buyers waited for the iPhone 5.\n\nFor the December quarter, Apple forecast revenue of $52 billion, below the average estimate of $55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It expects margins of 36 percent, far lower than analysts\u2019 expected 43 percent.\n\nChief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer mostly attributed the lower margin and conservative guidance to a combination of a stronger dollar, higher costs associated with new products, and the fact that Apple\u2019s next fiscal quarter has one less week than the same period a year ago.\n\nApple\u2019s stock was holding steady at $609.40 in extended trade after flirting with the $600 level. The shares had ended regular trade at $609.54.\n\nSupply constraints holding up sales of the iPad and iPhone dominated discussions between analysts and Apple executives during the post-results conference call. Apple had struggled to deliver large quantities of the iPhone 5 since its launch in late September, with the waitlist for the device at one point stretching to three weeks in some regions.\n\n\u201cOur supply output is significantly higher than it was earlier in October,\u201d Cook said, referring to the iPhone 5. \u201cAnd I\u2018m confident we\u2019ll be able to supply quite a few during the quarter.\u201d\n\nCook also opined on Microsoft\u2019s new Windows 8-based Surface tablet that will hit stores early on Friday.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t personally played with the Surface yet, but what we\u2019re reading about it, is that it\u2019s a fairly compromised, confusing product,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don\u2019t think it would do all of those things very well.\u201d\n\nDespite the lackluster fourth quarter, Apple put up big numbers for the year, ending its fiscal 2012 with a 45 percent increase in revenue to $156.5 billion, while net income was up 61 percent at $41.7 billion.\n\nFor the final fiscal quarter, it posted net income of $8.2 billion, or $8.67 a diluted share, on revenue of $35.96 billion, versus $6.6 billion, or $7.05 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected on average that Apple would earn $8.75 per share.\n\nApple ended the quarter with $121.3 billion in cash and securities, of which $83 billion was offshore."

Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 106 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 17 points.\n\n* Economic data expected later in the session includes the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers final October consumer sentiment index at 9:55 a.m. (1355 GMT). Economists in a Reuters survey expect a reading of 83.0 compared with 83.1 in the preliminary October report.\n\n* Dean Foods Co\u2019s gained 1.7 percent to $19.11 in light premarket trade as its Morningstar business has attracted takeover interest from Michael Foods and Mexican dairy company Grupo Lala, people familiar with the matter said, in a deal that could be valued in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range.\n\n* Newell Rubbermaid Inc reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its quarterly dividend by 50 percent to 15 cents a share but also said it would cut about 2,000 jobs over the next 2 1/2 years as it attempts to combat slower sales.\n\n* European equity markets eased, weighed down by a fresh batch of gloomy corporate outlooks, as the euro zone crisis put a dent in demand for everything from cars to building materials.\n\n* Asian shares and commodities slid as investors shunned risk on concerns over corporate earnings, with the region\u2019s exporters struggling against shrinking global demand."
