Apple is widely believed to be a major client of TDK, although the company has never publicly named it.\n\nTDK, once a successful audio tape maker, prospered in magnetic heads for hard disk drives until demand for personal computers peaked out.\n\nOver the last few years, it has revamped itself into a key smartphone parts supplier, with main products including rechargeable batteries, high-frequency filters that sort out radio signals, and tiny parts called capacitors that control the flow of electricity.\n\nTDK forecasts sales of smartphone-related components to grow to over 300 billion yen ($2.44 billion) in the next fiscal year from around 250 billion yen this year, Kamigama said.\n\nHe shrugged off growing concerns that smartphone shipments in China, the world\u2019s largest market, may continue to slow down. \u201cWe are confident on increasing our share in rechargeable batteries, because winners in the Chinese handset market are saying they want our batteries,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Kamigama stressed that the company is seeking to develop more stable revenue sources to reduce reliance on the volatile smartphone market. \u201cToo much reliance on smartphones is not good,\u201d he said.\n\nTDK is aiming to increase automobiles-related revenue to 350 billion yen in three years from 180 billion yen for the year that ended in March, the CEO said.\n\nKamigama is betting TDK\u2019s magnetic sensors, which measure the angle in the electric power steering systems and other devices in vehicles, will draw strong demand.\n\n\u201cWe are currently in talks with 40 major automakers and parts suppliers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company has applied its magnetic head technology to develop magnetic sensors. Its sensors have already been supplied to global parts suppliers such as Denso. ($ 1 = 123.1400 yen) (Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki and Reiji Murai; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"
