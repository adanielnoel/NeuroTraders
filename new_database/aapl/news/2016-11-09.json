        "body": "(Reuters) - TripAdvisor Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as the travel review website operator earned less from referrals to third-party hotel websites.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 13 percent at $54.89 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.\n\nTripAdvisor, which aggregates reviews and opinions about destinations and hotels, said its desktop-based platform is facing challenges as more people switch to mobile devices.\n\nThe company said its referral and transaction revenue fell 9.6 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.\n\nTripAdvisor\u2019s referral revenue has come under pressure after the company rolled out the instant booking feature, which allows booking of hotel rooms directly through the company\u2019s website.\n\nThe company is trying to aggressively promote the feature by partnering with hotel chains such as Marriott International Inc and travel website operators such as Priceline Inc\u2019s Booking.com.\n\nTripAdvisor said on Tuesday that it had made instant booking more prominent on the mobile app by favoring user engagement over generating revenue in the near term.\n\nThe company, which depends on ads and subscriptions for revenue, said hotel revenue fell 5.9 percent to $320 million. The division accounted for 76 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue in the third quarter.\n\nTotal revenue edged up 1.4 percent to $421 million, supported by higher sales in its non-hotel business, which includes restaurants and vacation rentals.\n\nNet income fell to $55 million, or 37 cents per share, in the latest quarter from $74 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2flaYx5)\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 53 cents per share.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of 52 cents per share and revenue of $436.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nUp to Tuesday\u2019s close, TripAdvisor\u2019s shares had shed a quarter of their value this year."

The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission\u2019s analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\u201d Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels."
