        "body": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan\u2019s export orders rose for a 13th straight month but at a slower pace in August, a boon for the region\u2019s tech-manufacturing economies riding the surge in global demand for electronics products.\n\nStrong exports of chips and other tech devices will set the export-driven economy up for a strong year-end and help Taiwan meet its bumped-up growth forecast of 2.11 percent this year. The solid outlook will also give the central bank leeway to stand pat on interest rates at its policy review on Thursday.\n\nExport orders in August jumped 7.5 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday, slower than the 8.5 percent median estimate in a Reuters poll and 10.5 percent in July. Total export order value for August was $40.8 billion.\n\nThe economics ministry said it expects September export orders to grow in the range of 1.3 to 3.6 percent, and total $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion, due to the deferred launches of some new smartphone models, Lin Li-chen, director of the ministry\u2019s statistics department, told a news conference.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s situation is not quite the same compared to the past where there was one main smartphone model type...It is related to the effect of the iPhone models,\u201d Lin added.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia\u2019s exports and for hi-tech gadgets such as Apple\u2019s new iPhone 8 and iPhone X, whose models will be launched in September and November, respectively.\n\nWhile both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will be available in September, the premium iPhone X won\u2019t be launched until November, slightly later than some expectations.\n\nThe product launches are likely to keep manufacturers busy well into the fourth quarter, as orders typically lead actual shipments by two to three months.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s near-term outlook for electronics exports will largely depend on Apple\u2019s supply chain pattern of production and shipments, DBS said in a research note ahead of the data.\n\nLast week, Apple announced three new iPhone models, including the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, and a premium version iPhone X which includes OLED screen and facial recognition technology.\n\n\u201cThe implications for Taiwan are that electronics exports will still enter a seasonal upturn from 3Q onwards, similar as in the previous years. But a strong rise may only emerge in 4Q when the mass production of iPhone X kicks in,\u201d DBS said in its note.\n\nDBS said demand for electronics components could remain buoyant well into the first half of 2018, due to belated support from the iPhone X.\n\nOrders from Taiwan\u2019s two biggest markets showed a mixed picture. While August export orders from China grew 11.6 percent on year, faster than 10.7 percent the previous month, they fell 0.8 percent from the United States versus 7.7 percent growth in July.\n\nFor 2017, U.S. export orders are still expected to be the biggest in volume terms, as many communications products orders come from the United States and Europe, particularly Apple orders, Lin said.\n\nExport orders leapt 21.3 percent from Europe and rose 13 percent from Japan.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Japan reported its strongest export growth in nearly 4 years on booming global demand for its cars and electronics."

        "body": "* Fed not expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday\n\n* Apple down on reports of connectivity issues with its smartwatch\n\nSept 20 (Reuters) - The S&P and the Dow were little changed on Wednesday but hovered near record levels as investors waited to hear from the Federal Reserve on future interest rate hikes this year while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was pulled lower by a drop in Apple.\n\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s shares fell 2.5 percent and was the biggest drag on all three indexes after reports that the company admitted to connectivity issues with its latest smartwatch.\n\nInvestors focused on Fed\u2019s policy statement and projections due to be released at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference half an hour later, which will be closely watched for views on inflation. The central bank is likely to keep interest rate unchanged and say that it will start unwinding its holdings of about $4.2 trillion in bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Inflation has remained below the Fed\u2019s 2-percent target rate, but a recent data showed uptick in domestic consumer prices, which raised the chances of a December rate hike by more than 50 percent for the first time since July.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is continuing to confirm the narrative that the lack of inflation has been somewhat transitory and expect inflation to pick up,\u201d said Emily Roland, head of investment research at John Hancock Investments in Boston.\n\n\u201cCertainly that will have a big influence as we look towards the readings on inflation going forward.\u201d\n\nTraders were betting on a 55.8 percent chance of a December hike, compared with 37.3 percent a month ago, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nAt 11:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.88 points, or 0.01 percent, at 22,368.92, the S&P was down 1.73 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,504.92 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 26.50 points, or 0.41 percent, at 6,434.82.\n\nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by 0.51 percent gain in the telecom services sector.\n\nThe technology index was the biggest laggard, weighed down by Apple, Adobe and Western Digital.\n\nAdobe fell 4 percent after the Photoshop maker\u2019s revenue forecast came in line with estimates.\n\nGeneral Mills was down about 5 percent after its quarterly profit missed estimates, hurt by lower sales of its yogurts and cereals in North America.\n\nShares of other food companies, including JM Smucker and Kellogg, were down about 2 percent.\n\nWestern Digital slipped more than 4 percent after Japan\u2019s embattled Toshiba agreed to sell its semiconductor business to a group led by private equity firm Bain Capital. The stock was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P technology index.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond sank 17 percent to its lowest since 2009 after the home furnishing retailer reported earnings and sales below estimates, prompting a slew of price target cuts.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,684 to 1,010. On the Nasdaq, 1,515 issues rose and 1,177 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)"

        "body": "HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Slowing innovation at iPhone maker Apple gives Asian rivals their best chance yet to conquer developed markets, retailers and consumers say - thanks to better designs and lower prices.\n\nApple last week unveiled new iPhones with wireless charging, an edge-to-edge screen and dual cameras - all features already widely available in phones from China\u2019s Huawei and Oppo, and Samsung Electronics.\n\nWhile Apple must convince buyers to fork out nearly $1,000 for its high-end model, challengers are tilting at the luxury market, offering similar features for less money.\n\nChinese vendors, formerly seen as churning out cheap phones with copycat innovation, have upped their quality game and now control nearly half the global mobile market. By cramming high-end features into affordable devices, and using a canny mix of promotion, advertising and retail reach, they have also won over some loyal Apple users.\n\n\u201cHuawei is seen as a relevant competitor to Apple and Samsung (by) covering all major price points and placing big investments in marketing and sales,\u201d said a spokeswoman for MediaMarktSaturn, Europe\u2019s biggest electronics retailer.\n\nShe said Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo and TCL - all Chinese firms - were among the top-10 best-selling smartphones in its stores.\n\nChinese manufacturers\u2019 rapid growth has been fueled by strong domestic sales, but they now export 40 percent of their smartphones, almost double the number just three years ago, according to CLSA.\n\nHuawei, whose smartphone shipments to Europe jumped more than 50 percent in the first half of this year, is poised to overtake Apple as the world\u2019s second-largest vendor.\n\nThe Chinese firm\u2019s confidence was on show in a short Facebook video ad ahead of its \u201cRealAIphone\u201d launch next month, using a clown to poke fun at Apple\u2019s facial recognition feature that unlocks the new iPhone.\n\nHuawei plans to unveil its top-of-the-line Mate 10 phone on Oct. 16, with artificial intelligence-powered features such as instant translation and image recognition. And media reports speculate the phone will have an edge-to-edge screen, and undercut the iPhone on price. Huawei declined to comment.\n\nWith their growing scale and the flattening of hardware improvements, other Chinese firms are also looking to crack the high-end smartphone market.\n\nXiaomi, for example, unveiled a full-screen phone this month that features a sleek, all-ceramic \u2018unibody\u2019 design and 12-megapixel front camera. The special edition Mi MIX 2 retails for $720. Also, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are working with Qualcomm to embed ultrasound sensors under smartphone screens to improve the touch function.\n\n\u201cChinese brands with growing scale, access to the same supply chain, rising components buying power, aggressive marketing and value-for-money offerings have stalled Apple\u2019s growth rate and nullified the differentiation points,\u201d said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint.\n\nApple declined to comment beyond what their executives have said publicly about why they hold off on certain technologies.\n\nTo be sure, Apple maintains a healthy market share lead over Chinese rivals in the premium segment, and few experts see Apple fans switching from the iPhone X to Huawei\u2019s Mate 10.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge they (Chinese firms) face would be proving to consumers their products and brand are worth paying that much for,\u201d said Xiaohan Tay, an analyst at research firm IDC.\n\n\u201cApple has taken years to build that premium brand image, and Samsung too. If they can pay a little more to purchase an Apple or Samsung phone, most consumers may still continue to do that.\u201d\n\nIn the $600-plus segment, Apple has 63 percent market share, against just 3 percent for Huawei, and the U.S. firm\u2019s retention rate of around 82 percent, versus Huawei\u2019s 52 percent, suggests it will be tough for Chinese firms to raise their prices, according to UBS.\n\nThe average selling price of smartphones from the top-3 Chinese makers - Huawei, Oppo and Vivo - is just $248, or two-thirds less than the cheapest iPhone 8.\n\nYet experts say the threat of competition is real, especially as buyers pay more attention to smartphone apps than hardware features.\n\n\u201cHow much impact would a $1,000 iPhone really have on UX (user experience) of WhatsApp, or YouTube, or Snapchat?\u201d said Sameer Singh, founder of research firm Tech-Thoughts.\n\n\u201cThe most popular apps being available on both platforms (Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android) really makes the experience a bit of a wash, making it harder to justify the price point based just on features. This isn\u2019t all that different from the PC industry 10-20 years ago. At one point, a PC was a PC irrespective of the manufacturer.\u201d"

The Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s bank sub-index rose 1.7 percent, while the securities sub-index added 1 percent and the index of other financials was 1.1 percent higher.\n\nShares of companies that supply components to Apple Inc slipped, after reports that a Rosenblatt Securities\u2019 analyst said iPhone 8 pre-orders have come in well below those for its predecessors.\n\nSeparately, Apple said on Wednesday its latest smartwatch unveiled a week ago has connectivity issues.\n\nMurata Manufacturing Co Ltd shed 1.1 percent, while Alps Electric Co Ltd tumbled 3.8 percent and Nitto Denko Corp dropped 1.3 percent. Apple shares declined 1.7 percent overnight.\n\nShares of Toshiba Corp skidded 1.9 percent. The beleaguered electronics giant is expected to formalise the sale of its prized memory chip unit on Thursday to a group led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, even as jilted suitor and joint venture partner Western Digital WDC.O took fresh legal action.\n\nElectronic commerce business operator Kakaku.com Inc rose 2.1 percent, after it said it will buy back up to 5 million of its own shares, or 2.3 percent of its shares outstanding.\n\nThe broader Topix and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 were both up 0.7 percent.
