        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will launch an expected \u201ciPhone 8\u201d on Tuesday, hoping the number\u2019s auspicious connotations in China will help turn around fortunes in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market.\n\nThe latest model is tipped to have a price tag upward of $1,000, compared with less than $800 for the top-end iPhone 7 Plus. That is unlikely to make a major dent in U.S. sales, analysts say, but could have a greater impact in China, where the cost is roughly double the average Chinese monthly salary.\n\nThe success of Apple\u2019s next iPhone in China is crucial for the Cupertino-based firm, which has seen its once-coveted phone slip into fifth position in China behind offerings from local rivals Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL].\n\nGreater China, which for Apple includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, accounted for roughly 18 percent of iPhone sales in the quarter ended in July, making it the company\u2019s top market after the United States and Europe. Yet those sales have been declining steadily and are down 10 percent from a year earlier, in contrast with growth in all other regions.\n\nAnd the iPhone\u2019s share of China\u2019s smartphone shipments fell to 9 percent in January-June, down from 14 percent in 2015, showed data from consultancy Counterpoint Research.\n\nWhile the iPhone 6 took China by storm in 2014, models since have received a more muted response.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait for a drop in price, it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d said Angie Chen, 23, a project manager in Nanjing and iPhone 6 owner.\n\nChen said she might wait for the new phone\u2019s successor, when prices will fall. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice number to hear, but there\u2019s no rush.\u201d\n\nEight is the luckiest number in China because it sounds similar to the phrase meaning \u201cto get rich\u201d.\n\n\u201cApple really needs to launch a very innovative product this time around,\u201d said Mo Jia, Shanghai-based analyst at Canalys. However, the rising clout of local rivals would nevertheless make life tough for the U.S. firm, he said. \u201cIt has its work cut out.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 7 suffered from the perception that it was too similar to earlier models. This time, despite talk of wireless charging, advanced touch screen and facial recognition technology, Chinese netizens are yet to replicate the online mania around previous iPhone launches.\n\nMentions of \u201ciPhone 8\u201d on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo - an indicator of consumer interest - were running slightly ahead of the similar period before the iPhone 7 launch, but were far more muted than with the iPhone 6.\n\nApple declined to comment on the new phone, price or supply.\n\nIn the United States, analysts are less certain that a $1,000 price will have a dramatic effect. Around four out of five of the consumers who in the past bought the top end model would likely be willing to do so again despite the price jump, estimated analyst and veteran Apple watcher Gene Munster of Loup Ventures.\n\nBeyond that, Apple is expected to cover other price points by retaining some sort of low-end model similar to the current iPhone SE, which sells for $399. That is likely to ensure iPhone customers stay within the Apple ecosystem even if prices on top-end models rise.\n\n\u201cThey need to still offer something for each market. They still will have that,\u201d Munster said.\n\nAnother factor for U.S. sales will be discounts from carriers, which might opt to use the buzz around the new iPhone launch to lure customers away from their competitors by offering deals that would soften the blow of higher prices.\n\n\u201cThe weapons of competition are increased phone subsidies, discounted phone payment plans and device trade-in offers,\u201d BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk wrote in a note to clients. \u201cPromotions are already on the rise for the Samsung phones introduced earlier this year.\u201d\n\nIn China, one effect of Apple\u2019s costliest phone to date will be the rise of sales on credit.\n\nWang Yang, who runs a bricks-and-mortar smartphone store in Beijing\u2019s largest tech market, said he expected more purchases online this time, as consumers make payments by instalment.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to stock the cheaper models or we won\u2019t sell much,\u201d he said.\n\nFenqile, a service founded by a former Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) executive that allows users to pay in instalments, said shoppers buying iPhones on the site had increased alongside rising prices - spiking in the second quarter of the year.\n\nServices backed by Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (BABA.N) and JD.com Inc (JD.O) have also introduced features this year aimed at price-conscious smartphone buyers, including flexible payment services and second-hand smartphone rentals.\n\nApple itself has launched an instalments plan in China supported by three state-linked banks.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s under $1,100 then I\u2019ll buy it,\u201d said Liu Song, 29, who works for a fintech startup in Beijing."

        "body": "CUPERTINO, Calif., Sept 12 (Reuters) - More than two years after releasing the Apple Watch, Apple Inc has finally been able to replicate 1940s comic strip technology, an advance that analysts say will spur sales.\n\nThe Series 3 of the Apple Watch, released on Tuesday along with the much-anticipated iPhone X, features wireless LTE connectivity. That means customers will be able to make phone calls or send text messages from the watch without needing to have an iPhone nearby, as they do with earlier models.\n\nThe ability to make calls with a wristwatch has captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts at least since it was prominently featured in \u201cDick Tracy,\u201d the comic about a private detective who, starting in 1946, used calls from his wrist to help bust bad guys.\n\n\u201cThis has been our vision from the beginning,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said at the launch event.\n\n\u201cNow you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected. It\u2019s really nice to know you can be reached if needed.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has sold smart watches with mobile data connectivity since 2014, but the first devices were bulky and suffered from poor battery life because the data connection consumed extra power. They also require a separate phone number.\n\nApple claims its new Series 3, on the other hand, will have up to 18 hours of battery life and is just a fraction of a millimeter thicker that its previous Series 2. And it will have the same phone number as a customer\u2019s iPhone, which will still be required for the initial set up of the watch.\n\nApple said that all four major U.S. carriers will offer service for the watch, and AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc both said it would cost an extra $10 a month.\n\nAnalysts generally believe the new connectivity could ignite sales, though there is little consensus as to how much.\n\nAt $399, the new Watch is only slightly more expensive than the previous model, the $329 Series 2, which introduced standalone GPS capability. That $70 extra buys much more useful capabilities - including the ability to stream music from Apple Music.\n\n\u201cThe third time is the charm for the watch,\u201d said Bob O\u2018Donnell of Techanalysis Research.\n\nWhat may hold some consumers back is the monthly recurring charge, which would far exceed the extra cost of the Series 3 over older watches over time, said Brian Blau, an Apple analyst with Gartner. \u201cYes, you do have to pay for that extra data plan, but it sounds like the carriers are at least going to make it relatively easy to do,\u201d Blau said.\n\nApple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi believes Apple will sell 12 million watches in its fiscal 2017 and 14 million to 15 million in fiscal 2018. Gene Munster with Loup Ventures predicted a much bigger bump, to 26 million units in 2018.\n\nEither way, Apple is putting new pressure on smartwatch rivals such as Fitbit Inc and Garmin Ltd, which would be hard-pressed from a technical and business standpoint to match Apple\u2019s wireless features.\n\nBut the new Apple Watch still requires an iPhone, which Fitbit believes leaves it ample market room to sell wearable devices that work with all phones, not just iPhones. \u201cWith Android comprising approximately 80 percent of the global smartphone market, broad compatibility remains a core differentiator for Fitbit,\u201d the company said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nGarmin did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours.\n\nThe Watch will remain a blip in Apple\u2019s sales, which were $215 billion last year. But it may be taking its place as part of a family of products that Apple loyalists cannot do without - all by making a schoolboy fantasy from the 1940s into reality for the masses."

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. consumers who want Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) newest iPhones, including its most expensive model yet, the iPhone X, may find fewer deals as wireless carriers are less willing to offer subsidies on devices in a saturated market.\n\nNew phone launches have long offered carriers a chance to gain market share by offering incentives such as free service and discounts. But customer defection rates fell to record lows in the last quarter as most people already have cell phones, a situation that creates less urgency to launch costly promotions to lure customers, analysts said.\n\nDeals for the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been pared back from the deals offered for the iPhone 7. (tmsnrt.rs/2f2Gche)\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, there\u2019s some regret on how promotional they were,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a telecom analyst at MoffettNathanson. The iPhone 7 trade-in offers were too easily copied by rivals, resulting in a costly move that offered no competitive advantage, he said.\n\nThe iPhone 8 model starts at $699, while the iPhone X will start at $999, Apple announced on Tuesday.\n\nT-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) said Tuesday it will give customers $300 off a new iPhone if they trade in an iPhone 6 or newer. Meanwhile, Sprint Corp (S.N) customers can save 50 percent off the monthly lease price of the iPhone 8 if they trade in an iPhone 6 or newer, as well as eligible Android devices.\n\nAT&T Inc (T.N) said it will include a 32GB iPad for $100 if customers buy the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus on a plan that allows subscribers to upgrade their phones as frequently as every year.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the No. 1 wireless carrier, said customers can get $300 off the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus when they sign up for unlimited and trade in select phones.\n\nBut the offers are less rich than last year, when all four major carriers offered up to a $650 credit if they traded in an iPhone 6, 6S or high-end Android device, BTIG Research said.\n\nJefferies analysts characterized the latest round of offers as a \u201cmore rational\u201d approach in a note on Wednesday, as last year\u2019s free iPhone deals weighed heavily on the carriers\u2019 margins.\n\nRepresentatives for T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T and Sprint did not provide additional details on their marketing plans, such as whether they will offer incentives for the iPhone X.\n\nEven with less generous promotions, the new iPhones should attract enough high-income consumers, including wealthy customers in China, said Brian White, analyst at Drexel Hamilton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great for Apple because they\u2019re starting to segment the market more, and now the consumers have more options,\u201d he said."

        "body": "CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out its much-anticipated iPhone X, a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Chief Executive Tim Cook called \u201cthe biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.\u201d\n\nThe launch contained few surprises, with leaked details on the phone and other products including an updated Apple Watch proving largely accurate. But the iPhone X\u2019s $999 price still raised eyebrows, and its Nov. 3 ship date prompted questions about possible supply constraints ahead of the holiday season.\n\nInvestors and fans have viewed the 10th-anniversary iPhone launch as an opportunity for Apple to refresh a smartphone lineup that had lagged the competition in new features. Last year the company\u2019s revenue declined when many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6.\n\nThe new Apple Watch for the first time will be able to make calls and access the internet without the customer carrying an iPhone -- a major upgrade that one analyst predicted would more than double watch sales.\n\nThe iPhone X has wireless charging, an infrared camera and hardware for facial recognition, which replaces the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone. The home button is also gone, and users instead tap the device to wake it up.\n\nApple normally ships new products within a week or two of announcing them, though the company said the later date was consistent with earlier guidance to investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to have a product but we\u2019d have liked it sooner rather than later, more like the beginning of October or mid- October,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.\n\nApple shares closed down 0.4 percent. They had traded as much as 1 percent higher during the launch event before reversing course.

        "body": "CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out its much-anticipated iPhone X, a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Chief Executive Tim Cook called \u201cthe biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.\u201d\n\nThe launch contained few surprises, with leaked details on the phone and other products including an updated Apple Watch proving largely accurate. But the iPhone X\u2019s $999 price still raised eyebrows, and its Nov. 3 ship date prompted questions about possible supply constraints ahead of the holiday season.\n\nInvestors and fans have viewed the 10th-anniversary iPhone launch as an opportunity for Apple to refresh a smartphone lineup that had lagged the competition in new features. Last year the company\u2019s revenue declined when many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6.\n\nThe new Apple Watch for the first time will be able to make calls and access the internet without the customer carrying an iPhone -- a major upgrade that one analyst predicted would more than double watch sales.\n\nThe iPhone X has wireless charging, an infrared camera and hardware for facial recognition, which replaces the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone. The home button is also gone, and users instead tap the device to wake it up.\n\nApple normally ships new products within a week or two of announcing them, though the company said the later date was consistent with earlier guidance to investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to have a product but we\u2019d have liked it sooner rather than later, more like the beginning of October or mid- October,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.\n\nApple shares closed down 0.4 percent. They had traded as much as 1 percent higher during the launch event before reversing course. The shares are up almost 40 percent on the year.\n\nTim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, said he was not worried about the ship date and liked the new phones features, but also flagged a lack of surprises.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sell on the news,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t talk about the evolution of Apple beyond the iPhone and into artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe screen on the iPhone X is about the size of the current iPhone 7 plus, though the phone is smaller.

        "body": "* Apple dips as iPhone X shipping date later than expected\n\n* Three Wall St indexes closed at record highs on Tuesday\n\nSept 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open slightly lower on Wednesday, after a two-day rally, weighed down by a drop in Apple and as North Korea showed a trademark defiance over new U.N. sanctions.\n\nApple\u2019s shares fell 0.83 percent in premarket trading after the highly-anticipated iPhone X was launched with a pricey $999 tag and a Nov. 3 shipping date that raised questions about supply constraints ahead of the holiday season.\n\nThe stock ended lower after a volatile session on Tuesday. But, the drag by Apple was more than offset by a rise in bank stock, helping the three major Wall Street indexes close at record highs.\n\nWall Street has been eking out record highs for most of this year, recovering from periodic setbacks caused by turmoil in Washington, questions over U.S. interest rate hikes and doubts about the Trump administration to push through its pro-business reforms, and lately, tensions over North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe slight weakness we\u2019re seeing this morning is after a two-day rally. The fundamentals and technicals, however remain strong,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.\n\n\u201cThere are concerns over the bull run, which is on several hope factors. But the list of worries is still there, geopolitical problems are far from solved and perhaps maybe tax reform not happening until 2018 - that would dampen the prospect of a stronger stock market.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea continued to keep the market on edge, after vowing to redouble efforts to fight off what it said was the threat of a U.S. invasion. The simmering tensions pushed gold prices higher.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT), Dow e-minis were down 14 points, or 0.06 percent, with 8,571 contracts changing hands.\n\nS&P 500 e-minis were down 3.75 points, or 0.15 percent, with 143,282 contracts traded.\n\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were down 12 points, or 0.2 percent, on volume of 14,035 contracts.\n\nCentene rose about 6 percent premarket after the health insurer said it would buy privately held Fidelis Care for $3.75 billion to enter New York.\n\nWestern Digital fell more than 3 percent after Toshiba agreed to focus on selling its chips unit to a group led by Bain Capital and SK Hynix, but did not rule out a deal with other bidders.\n\nNordstrom gained 6.28 percent after a source said the Nordstrom family has selected private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners to help take the high-end retailer private.\n\nMicron Technology was up more than 1 percent after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d.
