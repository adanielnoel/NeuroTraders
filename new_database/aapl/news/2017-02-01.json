        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple is working harder to squeeze juice out of its iconic iPhone. The company sold more units in the holiday quarter, yet profit fell. A saturating market and slowing innovation aren\u2019t helping margins. Yet the prospect of a new phone and the ability to sell additional services are bright spots that should keep investors on board.\n\nApple\u2019s figures are astonishing, with quarterly revenue hitting $78 billion and profit dialing in at $17.9 billion. Only a handful of American companies earn more in a year than Apple did in the quarter. Yet its fortunes are tied up in handsets, with the iPhone accounting for nearly 70 percent of sales. With perhaps 2.5 billion smartphones now being used around the world, according to various estimates, it\u2019s getting harder to find new customers. The company\u2019s revenue rose only 3 percent from the same period last year.\n\nMoreover, innovation is slowing. A faster processor, water resistance and better camera provided many users with reasons to upgrade to the company\u2019s latest handset, but these pale in comparison with the improvements of a few years ago. Apple is spending more money in R&D and cramming more expensive features into phones, but receiving less benefit. That\u2019s why despite record revenue and iPhone sales, income fell about 3 percent compared to the same period last year.\n\nTo compensate, Apple is tapping the iPhone in other ways. It\u2019s selling more services such as apps in its store, online data storage, streaming music and payments. They now account for 9 percent of revenue, a line the company hopes to double over the next four years. It\u2019s also selling more related items, such as its new wireless headphones. And Apple is trying to pinch suppliers. The company is suing wireless chip company Qualcomm to recoup $1 billion in rebates it claims it is owed, and slash the $15 \u2013 according to Sanford Bernstein \u2013 in royalties it pays on each iPhone sold.\n\nThe muted prospects explain why investors value Apple at just 13.5 times estimated 2017 earnings \u2013 25 percent below the S&P 500 average. That may be too steep a discount. Services will continue to grow. The company\u2019s cash pile has swelled to nearly $250 billion and investors would benefit from any reduction in taxes on repatriated funds. And the average customers\u2019 phone is getting older. Should Apple\u2019s next phone dazzle later this year, the result could be surprising growth.\n\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

        "body": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - Apple Inc reported its first quarterly increase in iPhone sales in a year, powered by strong demand for the latest version of its flagship smartphone, sending the company\u2019s shares up more than 3 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nApple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million last year. Analysts on average had estimated 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.\n\nThe results, which reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales, come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market.\n\nThe company is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for more than two-thirds of its total revenue.\n\nAnalysts and investors have already set their sights on Apple\u2019s 10th-anniversary iPhone, which is expected to feature better touchscreen technology, wireless charging and a shift to OLED display.\n\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said demand was especially high for the larger iPhone 7 Plus in the first quarter.\n\nRevenue in the services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud - jumped 18.4 percent to $7.17 billion, helped by the popularity of games, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, and increased revenue from subscriptions.\n\nAnalysts expect growth in the segment to help offset declining hardware sales as the smart phone market matures.\n\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on a conference call on Tuesday that he expects services revenue to double in the next four years.\n\n\u201cServices obviously continues to be a real success story for them. It\u2019s one of the fastest-growing segments they have, driven largely by the App Store,\u201d said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson.\n\nApple\u2019s revenue from the Greater China region fell 11.6 percent to $16.23 billion.\n\n\u201cWe were encouraged by our performance in China because it was clearly an improvement over the last couple of quarters. In mainland China in particular, our revenue was flat and actually grew in constant currency terms,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.\n\nThe company also forecast revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the current quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $53.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nAnalysts on average expect the company to sell 53.43 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nThe company\u2019s net income fell to $17.89 billion in the quarter from $18.36 billion a year ago. On a per share basis, it earned $3.36, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.12.\n\nRevenue rose 3.3 percent to $78.35 billion in the quarter, compared with the average estimate of $77.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nUp to Tuesday\u2019s close, Apple\u2019s shares have gained about 15 percent since mid-November, compared with the 5.3 percent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
