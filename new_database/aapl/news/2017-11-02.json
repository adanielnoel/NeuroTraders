        "body": "* Signs of strong demand, but high price may deter some\n\n* New iPhone X seen as key to Apple\u2019s China revival\n\n* Some re-sellers bemoan lack of scope for big premium\n\nSHANGHAI/BEIJING, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Gu Xiaomeng, a 24-year-old primary school teacher in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, says she\u2019s excited about the new iPhone X, set to go on sale on Friday. The challenge for Apple Inc is to persuade her to actually buy one.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m definitely interested, but don\u2019t currently plan to get one,\u201d said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary model\u2019s starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.\n\nFor Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won\u2019t necessarily translate into sales.\n\n\u201cPrice appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,\u201d Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.\n\nInvestors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple\u2019s fortunes in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.\n\nThe cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been \u201coff the charts\u201d.\n\nApple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.\n\nChatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo also signalled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.\n\nXiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8.\n\n\u201cI always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,\u201d he said, adding he likes the new phone\u2019s augmented reality and facial recognition features. \u201cI\u2019ll be very disappointed if I don\u2019t get one on the first day.\u201d\n\nWhile he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. \u201cBefore, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it\u2019s mostly the geeks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy friends don\u2019t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.\u201d\n\nRe-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple\u2019s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.\n\n\u201cPeople are really anticipating this phone because it\u2019s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,\u201d said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.\n\nYiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.\n\nA merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the \u201cE-Feng X\u201d from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were \u201cvery good\u201d.\n\nSome Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already cancelled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn\u2019t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.\n\n\u201cI saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I cancelled mine,\u201d said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. \u201cThe environment is bad for scalpers.\u201d\n\nApple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.\n\nWang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S.\n\n\u201cThe cost is about a month\u2019s salary for me,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cBut I\u2018m just used to it now, and there wasn\u2019t really anything to make me choose another brand.\u201d"

        "body": "* Fed statement on policy meeting at 2:00 p.m. ET\n\nNov 1 (Reuters) - The S&P and the Dow were higher on Wednesday, as energy stocks gained from a jump in oil prices and strong private jobs data pointed to the strength in the labor market, while Apple\u2019s 1 percent drop limited gains on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe recent rally on Wall Street has been supported by strong third-quarter results from technology and consumer companies amid concerns over stretched valuations.\n\n\u201cEarnings drive the markets, and they continue to be really good,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\n\nThird-quarter earnings have been largely positive, with 73 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent profit-beat rate in the past four quarters.\n\nOn Wednesday, cosmetics maker Estee Lauder, US Steel and Garmin all reported strong results. Estee Lauder rose nearly 10 percent, US Steel 11 percent and Garmin 5.51 percent.\n\nInvestors are also tracking the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting that concludes later on Wednesday. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged as speculation swirls on who will be its next leader, but will likely point to a firming economy as it edges closer to a possible rate rise next month.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe anybody in the world thinks the Fed is going to do anything with the interest rates now. What they may say about December or next year is what the market is watching for,\u201d said Kinahan.\n\nThe White House has said President Donald Trump will announce his Fed pick on Thursday. Trump is expected to choose Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who is seen as more stock-market friendly, sources have told Reuters.\n\nAt 10:52 a.m. ET (1452 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 120.91 points, or 0.52 percent, at 23,498.15, the S&P 500 was up 10.24 points, or 0.40 percent, at 2,585.5 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 8.55 points, or 0.13 percent, at 6,736.22.\n\nU.S. private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, the most since March and exceeding a median forecast of 200,000 among economists polled by Reuters, the ADP National Employment Report showed.\n\nThe focus now shifts to Friday\u2019s more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report for October. The report will include both public and private-sector employment.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by gains in the energy sector.\n\nOil hit its highest since mid-2015 on data that showed OPEC significantly improved compliance with its pledged supply cuts and Russia is also widely expected to keep to the deal.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,767 to 960. On the Nasdaq, 1,421 issues rose and 1,286 fell."
