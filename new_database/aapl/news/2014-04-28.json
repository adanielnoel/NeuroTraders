Leading the Nasdaq down was Amazon.com, which extended Friday\u2019s sharp decline a day after its earnings report.\n\nA flurry of merger and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical sector lifted shares. Shares of Pfizer Inc gained 4.2 percent to $32.04 after the U.S. drugmaker was said to be working on its next move in a potential $100 billion bid to take over Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca Plc, after two earlier bids were rejected.
