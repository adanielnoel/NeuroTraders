        "body": "TIPUTINI, Ecuador (Reuters) - Ecuador began drilling for oil on Wednesday near an Amazon nature reserve known as Yasuni, a site that President Rafael Correa had previously sought to protect from development and pollution under a pioneering conservation plan.\n\nCorrea in 2007 asked wealthy countries to donate $3.6 billion to offset revenue lost by not drilling in the Yasuni National Park. But the initiative was scrapped in 2013 after it brought in less than 4 percent of the amount requested.\n\nCorrea\u2019s government blamed the international community for the failure of a plan once seen as a possible model for other developing countries seeking to resist the lure of oil money.\n\nWednesday\u2019s drilling by the state oil company Petroamazonas began in the ITT (Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini) block at Tiputini, which is just outside Yasuni. Ishpingo and Tambococha are within the Yasuni reserve itself.\n\nCorrera has said previously that drilling would affect less than 1 percent of the reserve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the start of a new era for Ecuadorean oil,\u201d said Vice President Jorge Glas after a tour of the site on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn this new era, first comes care for the environment and second responsibility for the communities and the economy, for the Ecuadorean people,\u201d he told reporters, adding that the cost of production was less than $12 per barrel.\n\nEcuador is OPEC\u2019s smallest member and has suffered heavily from the fall in oil prices. Around half its income comes from oil, according to the World Bank.\n\nIt is also one of the world\u2019s most biodiverse nations, boasting Amazon rainforest, Andean mountains and the Galapagos Islands.\n\nThe end of Ecuador\u2019s conservation initiative for the eastern Yasuni, a vast swath of rainforest on the equator, drew outrage from environmentalists when it was first announced.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst imaginable place to be drilling for oil. The world can simply not afford to lose a place like Yasuni,\u201d said Kevin Koenig, Ecuador program director at Amazon Watch, in a statement.\n\nAbout 1.67 billion barrels of oil lie under Yasuni\u2019s soil.\n\nWith output from the Tiputini field, Ecuador\u2019s oil production will rise to some 570,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a current level of about 550,000 bpd, government officials say."
