        "body": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc began offering electronics from third-party sellers to Brazilian shoppers on Wednesday, expanding beyond books in the fiercely competitive e-commerce market in Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe long-awaited move will offer televisions, cell phones and laptops from hundreds of independent sellers on Amazon\u2019s website in Brazil without involving the company in the tricky logistics that have hurt many online retailers in the country.\n\nAlex Szapiro, Amazon\u2019s country manager in Brazil, declined to say if there were plans for the company to stock its own electronics inventory or open a fulfillment center to ship third-party goods more efficiently, as it did simultaneously with the launch of independent sellers in Mexico two years ago.\n\n\u201cEach country has a different playbook,\u201d said Szapiro in an interview with Reuters at Amazon headquarters in Sao Paulo. He helped launch the company\u2019s Brazil business with e-books in 2012 after running operations for Apple Inc in the country for five years.\n\nShares of local e-commerce rivals MercadoLibre Inc, Magazine Luiza SA and B2W Cia Digital have fallen 14 percent, 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the past week on concerns of heightened competition from Amazon.\n\nKeeping pace with the local e-commerce market, Amazon will parcel purchases into as many as 10 monthly installments without interest, a practice the company started in Brazil for Kindle e-reader sales in 2014, then extended to Mexico and other markets.\n\nSellers will be paid up-front, minus a 10 percent commission to Amazon and fees of 19 reais ($6) per month or 2 reais per item. Szapiro called the 10 percent commission a \u201cpromotional\u201d rate without saying when or how much it would eventually rise."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon Studios (AMZN.O) chief Roy Price has resigned, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday, following allegations that he harassed a producer and took no action when an actress told him she was sexually assaulted by producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nPrice went on a leave of absence last week and Albert Cheng, the studio\u2019s chief operating officer, remains interim head of the division, the spokeswoman said.\n\nPrice did not return requests for comment.\n\nMany women have shared their experiences of mistreatment on social media using the hashtag #MeToo, in the wake of allegations of harassment against Weinstein in reports this month by The New York Times and The New Yorker.\n\nWeinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter last week reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc\u2019s shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.\n\nOn Tuesday, a lawyer for Hackett confirmed the allegations.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m pleased Amazon is taking steps to address the issues,\u201d Hackett said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAn important conversation has begun about the need to create a culture in our industry which values respect and decency and rejects the abuse of power and dehumanizing treatment of others.\u201d\n\nThe accusations against Price represented a rare scandal for the online retailer.\n\n\u201cThis is a necessary move because of the sexual harassment allegation, but I think it\u2019s a convenient excuse to replace him,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nAmazon fared poorly for its original TV shows at last month\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards. Pachter said the company has appealed to elite, liberal tastes with its original TV lineup but has lacked \u201ccontent that has mass appeal.\u201d\n\nAmazon did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nAmazon is investing some $4.5 billion this year on video content. The company has said it hopes original shows will encourage people to sign up for its streaming and shopping club Prime."

        "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - Supermarket retailer Casino (CASP.PA) cooled talk of a deal with Amazon (AMZN.O), as it posted higher third quarter sales that lifted its shares.\n\nCasino, whose credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor\u2019s in March 2016 and which has been criticized by U.S. activist fund Muddy Waters, is under pressure to show it can revive profits in its French home market as conditions remain tough for its business in Brazil.\n\nAmazon\u2019s $13.7 billion takeover of Whole Foods Market this year sparked speculation that it might be examining further tie-ups, possibly involving logistics partnerships with French supermarket operators.\n\nHowever, Casino\u2019s finance director Antoine Giscard d\u2018Estaing told reporters that such rumors were \u201cfake news\u201d, and that Casino had not received any demands from Amazon over using its purchasing center or regarding a logistics tie-up.\n\nCasino, which controls Brazil\u2019s top retailer Grupo Pao de Acucar (PCAR4.SA), said group third quarter sales reached 9.2 billion euros ($10.8 billion), compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for 9.119 billion euros.\n\nCasino shares gained 1.5 percent in morning trading, among the best performers on the Paris market. The stock is up nearly 10 percent so far in 2017, outperforming a 3 percent fall on the STOXX Europe 600 retail index .SXRP.\n\nCasino\u2019s sales were up 3.4 percent on an organic basis, marking a moderate improvement from 3.3 percent growth in the second quarter, due to an improvement at its domestic stores in France such as Monoprix, Geant and its online Cdiscount unit.\n\nCasino also reiterated its 2017 financial targets, which include expecting growth of more than 15 percent regarding food retail trading profits in France."

        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - A UK parliamentary report has criticized Amazon and eBay for not doing enough to prevent tax fraud on their online market places and recommended the government hold the online giants accountable for tax lost to evaders.\n\nIn April the National Audit Office said Britain was losing up to 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) a year in value-added-tax (VAT) because of fraud or error by frequently China-based sellers on eBay and Amazon.\n\nThe Public Accounts Committee published the results of an investigation into the problem on Wednesday which said the companies had been slow to take even basic actions to tackle fraud, such as requesting VAT registration numbers.\n\nThe investigation also said the companies had resisted sharing data with Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the UK tax authority.\n\n\u201cThese people are profiting from VAT fraud, because they still take their commission,\u201d said member of parliament Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the committee.\n\nThe companies say they take the problem seriously. A spokeswoman for eBay said it wants a fair marketplace for all its buyers and sellers. An Amazon spokesman said the company was reviewing the committee\u2019s recommendations.\n\nHillier said the fraud was costing jobs at UK online retailers who were being undercut by rivals not charging VAT.\n\nHMRC, which estimates total VAT fraud involving all online marketplaces of up to 1.5 billion pounds, had also not pursued the problem with vigor and had failed to use all the powers at its disposal, the report said.\n\nThe government last year introduced measures to cut down on online VAT fraud, including the potential for marketplaces to be held liable for unpaid VAT where they had ignored calls to remove illegal sellers.\n\nHowever, the committee said these measures were not strong enough and indeed potentially totally ineffective.\n\nThe committee said VAT was regularly being evaded on goods stored in UK-based \u201cfulfillment centers\u201d or warehouses and dispatched by UK-based companies including Amazon\u2019s UK arm.\n\nIn the past the frauds often involved goods dispatches direct from places such as China."

        "body": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil\u2019s Amazon fell 16 percent in the year to July 2017 compared to the same period a year prior, the first decline in three years, the country\u2019s environment minister said on Tuesday.\n\nReasons for the decline included stepped-up enforcement and refinements in real-time monitoring that allow for rapid response to deforestation, Minister Jose Sarney Filho told a news conference at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia.\n\nHowever, Paulo Barreto, a senior researcher for non-profit Amazon institute Imazon, said economic recession in Brazil and a drop in livestock prices were likely the major cause for the decline. The cattle industry is a major contributor to deforestation.\n\nThe Amazon, the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, soaks up vast amounts of carbon and is seen as vital to the fight against climate change.\n\nPRODES satellite data, which serves as the official government benchmark, showed 6,624 square kilometers (2,558 square miles) of forest were destroyed between August 2016 and July 2017, compared to 7,893 square kilometers in 2015/2016.\n\nThe rate remains well above the 4,571 square kilometers deforested in 2012, which was the low since records began in 2004/2005.\n\n\u201cSurveillance and control help, but it is not a solution. We will only end deforestation when we value the standing forest,\u201d Sarney said.\n\n\u201cBut we are reaching the limit. If we do not fulfill international agreements, especially for payment for environmental services, it will be very difficult to maintain the fall in deforestation,\u201d he said, referencing a system of payments to landowners in exchange for maintaining forest on their property.\n\nEnvironmentalists said the fall was important but it was too soon to celebrate.\n\nDeforestation needs to fall much further in order for Brazil to meet its climate change targets, said Alfredo Sirkis, general coordinator for the Brazil Forum for Climate Change.\n\nDeforestation must fall to an annual loss of no more than 4,000 square kilometers by 2020 to meet a climate change target known as a nationally appropriate mitigation action (NAMA), a concept adopted in connection with the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, said Sirkis, a former politician and co-founder of Brazil\u2019s green party.\n\n\u201cAt least we can say the curve has inverted, but there\u2019s lots of stuff to do, and we have to try harder,\u201d Sirkis said."
