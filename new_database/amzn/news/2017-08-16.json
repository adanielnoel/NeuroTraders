        "body": "BERKELEY, Calif (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is rolling out U.S. pickup points where shoppers can retrieve items immediately after ordering them, shortening delivery times from hours to minutes in its latest move into brick-and-mortar retail.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest online retailer has launched \u2018Instant Pickup\u2019 points around five college campuses, such as the University of California at Berkeley, it said on Tuesday. Amazon has plans to add the program to more sites by the end of the year.\n\nShoppers on Amazon\u2019s mobile app can select from several hundred fast-selling items at each location, from snacks and drinks to phone chargers. Amazon employees in a back room then load orders into lockers within two minutes, and customers receive bar codes to access them.\n\nThe e-commerce company, which said in June it would buy Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion, has come to realize that certain transactions like buying fresh produce are hard to shift online. Its Instant Pickup program targets another laggard: impulse buys.\n\n\u201cI want to buy a can of coke because I\u2019m thirsty,\u201d said Ripley MacDonald, Amazon\u2019s director of student programs. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance I\u2019m going to order that on Amazon.com and wait however long it\u2019s going to take for that to ship to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can provide that kind of service here,\u201d he said of the new program.\n\nAmazon\u2019s ability to shorten delivery times has been a sore point for brick-and-mortar retailers, who have struggled to grow sales as customers have turned to convenient online options. Until Instant Pickup, Amazon shoppers could expect their orders within an hour at best via the company\u2019s Prime Now program, or within 15 minutes for grocery orders via AmazonFresh Pickup.\n\n\u201cThis is a natural extension of their larger push into the grocery space,\u201d said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy, noting Instant Pickup could capture small purchases by consumers in between their larger shopping trips.\n\nInstant Pickup also puts Amazon in competition with vending machine services. Yet it is unlikely to threaten those selling snack machines to offices and schools.\n\n\u201cThis might work for some electronic gadgets that are not commonly available at vending machines,\u201d said Forrester analyst Ananda Chakravarty. \u201cTwo minutes is too long to wait for a soda can.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, Amazon has opened 22 U.S. locations for same-day pickup. The Instant Pickup program will rely on these same facilities, launching in Berkeley, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Columbus, Ohio and College Park, Maryland."

        "body": "BERKELEY, Ca. Aug 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is rolling out pickup points in the United States where shoppers can retrieve items immediately after ordering them, shortening delivery times from hours to minutes, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest online retailer has launched \u2018Instant Pickup\u2019 points around five college campuses, such as the University of California at Berkeley, it said. Amazon has plans to open more sites by the end of the year including one in Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park neighborhood.\n\nShoppers on Amazon\u2019s mobile app can select from several hundred fast-selling items at each site, from snacks and drinks to phone chargers. Amazon employees in a back room then load orders into lockers within two minutes, and customers receive bar codes to access them.\n\nThe news underscores Amazon\u2019s broader push into brick-and-mortar retail. The e-commerce company, which said in June it would buy Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion, has come to realize that certain transactions like buying fresh produce are hard to shift online. Its Instant Pickup program targets another laggard: impulse buys.\n\n\u201cI want to buy a can of coke because I\u2019m thirsty,\u201d said Ripley MacDonald, Amazon\u2019s director of student programs. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance I\u2019m going to order that on Amazon.com and wait however long it\u2019s going to take for that to ship to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can provide that kind of service here,\u201d he said of the new program.\n\nInstant Pickup puts Amazon in competition with vending machine services. Yet the larger size of the Amazon sites means they are unlikely to pose a threat to those selling snack and drink vending machines to offices and schools. MacDonald said Amazon considered automating the Instant Pickup points but declined to say why the company had not pursued the idea.\n\nAmazon\u2019s ability to shorten delivery times has been a sore point for brick-and-mortar retailers, who have struggled to grow sales as their customers have turned to more convenient online options. Until Instant Pickup, Amazon shoppers could expect to have their orders within an hour at best via the company\u2019s Prime Now program, or within 15 minutes for grocery orders via AmazonFresh Pickup. Amazon has made two-day shipping standard in the United States.\n\nInstant Pickup prices may be cheaper than those on Amazon.com, MacDonald said. He declined to detail how the items are priced, however.\n\nOther locations in the program now open include Los Angeles, Atlanta, Columbus, Ohio and College Park, Maryland.
