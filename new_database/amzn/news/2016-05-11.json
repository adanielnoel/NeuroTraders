Oil was up over 3 percent as supply disruptions in Canada and elsewhere overshadowed fears of oversupply.\n\nWorld stock markets had also risen, helped by solid corporate earnings in Europe, progress on Greek debt talks, and a new pledge by Japan that it was prepared to weaken the yen.\n\n\u201cComments from Japan regarding an intervention in the yen and a stabilization in oil prices are helping equities today,\u201d said Dan Farley, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also at the end of the earnings season and while we aren\u2019t expecting a massive improvement in profit, I do expect to see some revenue growth in the second quarter.\u201d\n\nAt 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 173.37 points, or 0.98 percent, at 17,879.28, the S&P 500 was up 18.39 points, or 0.89 percent, at 2,077.08 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 32.58 points, or 0.69 percent, at 4,782.78.\n\nThe S&P 500, which has risen about 15 percent since its February lows, has seen its rally slow in the last two weeks due to underwhelming quarterly earnings and mixed U.S. economic data.\n\nHowever, a three-day losing streak was broken on Friday after a disappointing U.S. jobs report suggested the Federal Reserve would raise rates just once this year. Wall Street also ended mostly higher on Monday as healthcare shares rose.\n\nThe S&P industrials sector was up about 1.33 percent. The financials index gained 1.21 percent, with Goldman up 2 percent and JPMorgan up 1.4 percent.\n\nGap tumbled 12.7 percent to $19, the biggest drop among S&P 500 companies, after the retailer reported a decline in sales for the fifth straight quarter.\n\nAllergan was up 5.9 percent at $226.46 after the Botox maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,082 to 731.

        "body": "CANNES, France (Reuters) - The Cannes film festival is partly opening the door for streaming video giants this year, allowing Amazon to make its debut on the Croisette while leaving Netflix out of its 69th annual session.\n\nFestival director Thierry Fremaux says Amazon\u2019s presence is good news because its SVOD (streaming video on demand) service releases its films in cinemas before they are streamed online.\n\nThe film industry prefers having these so-called \u201crelease windows\u201d - usually three months - when they can show the film exclusively. Netflix releases its films at the same time in cinemas and online.\n\n\u201cAmazon is different from Netflix. It is a real distributor, producer,\u201d he told Reuters before Wednesday\u2019s opening ceremony.\n\n\u201cThey have Woody Allen but also some foreign films, so it\u2019s good news because thanks to them these films will be distributed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe festival will kick off with Woody Allen\u2019s \u2018Cafe Society\u2019, one of five Amazon films selected in Cannes. Three of them have been picked for the main competition.\n\nNicolas Winding Refn\u2019s \u2018The Neon Demon\u2019, Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u2018Paterson\u2019 and \u2018Gimme Danger\u2019 and Park Chan-wook\u2019s \u2018The Handmaiden\u2019 are also Amazon\u2018s.\n\n\u201cThe presence of Amazon is not significant (just) for the Cannes film festival, it\u2019s significant for the whole industry of cinema,\u201d Fremaux said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good news, it\u2019s money, a new kind of money. Having Amazon buying four, five films is a very good sign showing cinema is alive.\u201d\n\nThis year, Netflix and Amazon bought a combined total of 12 films at the Sundance film festival and the Venice film festival screened Netflix\u2019s \u2018Beasts of No Nation\u2019 last year."
