I am very consistent on that,\u201d said Schultz, who in April fueled talk he was preparing for a presidential run by resigning as Starbucks\u2019 chief executive.

Upstanders launched last year on the Starbucks app, which has 19 million active users, and the chain\u2019s in-store wireless network.\n\nIn addition to Amazon.com\u2019s Prime video streaming service, Upstanders Season 2 will be available on Facebook\u2019s new Watch video platform, on Starbucks\u2019 website at starbucks.com/upstanders and as a free audio book on Amazon\u2019s Audible.com.\n\nRajiv Chandrasekaran, Starbucks\u2019 executive producer on the project, said the mission behind \u201cUpstanders\u201d is simple.\n\n\u201dIf these stories can lead people in other communities to say, \u2018Hey, I can do that too,\u201c that will be mission accomplished for us,\u201d Chandrasekaran, a former editor at the Washington Post, said during the interview."
