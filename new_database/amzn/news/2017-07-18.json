        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents retail workers, sent a letter to antitrust enforcers on Monday warning about the dangers of Amazon\u2019s (AMZN.O) purchase of Whole Foods WFM.O both to workers and consumers.\n\nThe union, which does not represent Whole Foods employees but 800,00 clerks and other workers at other grocery chains, asked the Federal Trade Commission to carefully scrutinize the $13.7 billion deal but did not ask for it to be stopped.\n\n\u201cAmazon arguably poses a greater threat to our retail economy than any other online or traditional brick and mortar grocer,\u201d UFCW International President Marc Perrone wrote in a letter to the FTC.\n\nThe deal\u2019s announcement last month sent grocery store share prices reeling because of the possibility that Amazon would move into food sales in a big way. Beset by online competition, retail bankruptcies this year have included big names like Radio Shack.\n\nPerrone argued that the proposed transaction would hurt consumers by giving Amazon such power over suppliers that prices could go up while the quality and variety of products could be reduced.\n\nPerrone also argued that automation would lead to reduced employment. \u201cAmazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods is not about improving customer service, products or choice. It is about destroying Whole Foods jobs through Amazon-style automation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAmazon has said previously that it has no plans to automate the jobs of Whole Foods cashiers and plans no job cuts.\n\nAmazon and the FTC declined comment for this story."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of meal-kit service Blue Apron Holdings Inc APRN.O slumped to new lows on Monday in the wake of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O)\u2019s move to register a trademark for a possible rival service.\n\nBlue Apron shares tumbled more than 11 percent to $6.51, a drop of nearly 35 percent since its June 29 initial public offering price of $10. The decline came as investors were concerned about its future and the impact of Amazon\u2019s planned $13.7 billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.N amid a fast-expanding meal-kit industry.\n\nIn a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on July 6, Amazon registered a trademark application for \u201cprepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or vegetables\u201d that is ready for cooking and assembly as a meal.\n\nAmazon\u2019s planned service is identical to the one offered by Blue Apron, one of the largest meal-kit delivery services in the United States.\n\nActivity in Blue Apron\u2019s options also leaned toward defensive bets, with put options that make money if the shares drop below $5 by the third week of January drawing the most activity on Monday.\n\nAmazon and Blue Apron were not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe deal between Amazon and Whole Foods announced in June marks the biggest acquisition for the world\u2019s largest online retailer. Amazon has not said exactly what it would do with Whole Foods\u2019 stores and other assets, but analysts and investors say the deal could upend the landscape for grocers, food delivery services and meal-kit companies.\n\nLast week, the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee, David Cicilline, voiced concerns about Amazon\u2019s plan to buy Whole Foods, pushing for a hearing to look into the deal\u2019s impact on consumers.\n\nAmazon shares rose nearly 1 percent to $1010.93 on Monday, up 4.4 percent for the month, while Blue Apron shares were off about 30 percent for July. The e-commerce giant hit an all-time of $1,017 last month."
