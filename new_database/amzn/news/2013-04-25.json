        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s first-quarter revenue jumped 22 percent to $16.1 billion, propelled by growing sales of digital content, cloud-computing services and gains in retail. But it forecast weak sales this quarter, raising concerns about a slowing international business.\n\n\u201dThis quarter is a bit of a \u2018tweener\u2019 so to speak: the company gave you a favorable margin, which is evident in both gross-margin performance and the upside in earnings, and then sales while not spectacular were good.\n\n\u201dIncrease in third-party unit sales has been funding their gross margins.\n\n\u201dWhen I read the guidance for Q2 for operating margins, it suggests to me they\u2019re telegraphing that the company is going to continue a heightened rate of investment.\n\n\u201cLooking at the international performance, I think the message there is North America was better than expected but international was softer. The questions is: is this a reflection of macro trends in Europe, or is there something else going on there?\u201d\n\n\u201dThe fundamentals of the business improved significantly. So you saw a material improvement in gross margins, as well as a significant upside to estimates for their pro-forma operating margins. The trends are moving in the right direction fundamentally for the company.\n\n\u201dThe high end of the guidance for revenue was above the Street. The pro-forma operating margins were slightly below the Street on the high end but they typically guide conservatively on that. Net, net it was a good print.\n\n\u201dThe margins in international declined and that was a weak post.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that Amazon is really getting leverage from shipping costs. AWS is becoming a big part of their mix. They are also benefiting from a greater mix of advertising revenues. We\u2019ll continue to see that improve.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe numbers came in relatively in-line.\n\n\u201dGuidance was maybe slightly disappointing. But when you look at the gross profit for the quarter, it beat expectations. They grew gross profit at 35 percent year-over-year.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, at least on that basis, they are showing some very good progress. You are seeing benefit from the higher-margin Amazon Web Services business, and also higher-margin third-party marketplace business.\u201d\n\n\u201dGross margin is definitely better than expected. That is something that investors are certainly keen on.\n\n\u201cGuidance was light, both top- and bottom-line. That certainly won\u2019t help the stock perform, although they have over the last several quarters exceeded expectations on the operating income side. So for the guidance, people are more concerned about revenue than operating income.\u201d"

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s revenue growth slowed in the first quarter as the world\u2019s largest Internet retail struggled overseas, but margins jumped on lower shipping expenses and the expansion of more profitable new businesses.\n\nAmazon shares fell 1.9 percent to $269.43 in after-hours trading on Thursday following the results.\n\n\u201cThe message there is North America was better than expected but international was softer. The question is ... \u2018Is this a reflection of macro trends in Europe, or is there something else going on there?'\u201d said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Tom Forte.\n\nEurope\u2019s lackluster economies are weighing on corporate sales in the region - even for fast-growing e-commerce businesses. EBay Inc, Amazon\u2019s main rival, reported disappointing results last week and noted European weakness.\n\nAmazon\u2019s revenue rose 22 percent to $16.07 billion, propelled by growing sales of digital content, cloud-computing services and gains in its main retail business. But it was a decline from 36 percent growth in the first quarter of 2012.\n\nInternational revenue rose 16 percent in the most-recent quarter, year-over-year, down from a 31 percent growth rate in the same period of 2012.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak was peppered with questions about slowing growth.\n\n\u201cThere is some softness from a macro standpoint that others are seeing,\u201d the CFO said.\n\nAmazon has also struggled to grow in China and the CFO told analysts the company is still in \u201cinvestment mode\u201d in that country.\n\nSzkutak reported that total year-over-year unit growth, which measures the number of items Amazon sells, was 30 percent in the first quarter, down from 49 percent in the first quarter of 2012.\n\n\u201cUnit growth is slowing which disappointed some,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. \u201cThe law of large numbers is affecting Amazon too. You can\u2019t grow 100 percent forever, otherwise you become the universe.\u201d\n\nAmazon forecast second-quarter revenue of $14.5 billion to $16.2 billion and operating results from break-even to $350 million. The latter guidance excludes stock-based compensation expenses and other items such as amortization of intangible assets.\n\nWall Street was looking for second-quarter revenue of $15.94 billion and operating results of $452 million, according to Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDespite weaker growth and a cautious forecast, Amazon\u2019s results showed that the company is becoming more profitable.\n\nGross profit margin, a closely watched measure of profitability, came in at a better-than-expected 26.6 percent, compared with 24 percent a year earlier.\n\nThe first-quarter gross margin was the highest in at least a decade, according to Scott Tilghman, an analyst at B Riley & Co.\n\nAmazon is building distribution warehouses closer to customers, reducing shipping costs. It has also been charging third-party merchants on its marketplace higher fees for shipping and warehouse storage.\n\nIn the first quarter, net shipping costs were 4.7 percent of sales, down from 5.1 percent a year earlier.\n\nMoving into other areas is also boosting margins.\n\nThe company mainly operates as a retailer, buying physical products at wholesale prices, storing them and then selling at a slight mark-up to consumers online. But it has expanded into other businesses that are potentially more profitable, including cloud computing, advertising, digital content and acting as an online marketplace for other merchants.\n\nThese newer businesses are growing faster than the company\u2019s original retail operations, boosting profitability.\n\nAmazon\u2019s web services (AWS) and advertising businesses are reported in a segment the company calls \u201cother.\u201d Revenue from this area surged 59 percent to $798 million in the quarter.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, at least on that (profit) basis, they are showing some very good progress,\u201d said Evercore analyst Ken Sena. \u201cYou are seeing benefit from the higher-margin Amazon Web Services business, and also higher-margin third-party marketplace business.\u201d"
