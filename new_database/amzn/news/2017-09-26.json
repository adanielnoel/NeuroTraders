        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her producer-husband Daniel Palladino have signed a multi-year deal with its studio division to make original shows.\n\nThe producer duo\u2019s first original series for Amazon - \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d starring Rachel Brosnahan and set in 1958 New York City - will debut this fall on Amazon Prime video.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the next two seasons of \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 with them and, with this deal, we can\u2019t wait to do a lot more together,\u201d said Joe Lewis, head of Comedy, Drama and VR at Amazon Studios on Monday.\n\nAmazon has been spending billions of dollars a year on creating and licensing TV shows and films, as the retailer gears up to better compete with market leader, Netflix Inc.\n\nOther technology firms such as Apple Inc and Facebook Inc were also getting into producing original shows.\n\nWall Street analysts estimate Amazon\u2019s spending on content would triple to more than $4.5 billion by the end of this year from 2014.\n\nSherman-Palladino created in 2000 \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d that focused on mother-daughter relationship in an imaginary town. Time magazine listed the show among its \u201c100 Best TV Shows of All Time.\u201d\n\nHer husband, Daniel Palladino, started working for TV series in 1989 with ABC hit \u201cWho\u2019s the Boss?\u201d starring Tony Danza, Judith Light and Alyssa Milano.\n\nHe also worked on shows such as \u201cThe Return of Jezebel James\u201d, dance drama \u201cBunheads\u201d, \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and Fox animated hit \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon is the future of television and we are thrilled to tag along for the ride,\u201d the Palladinos said a statement."

        "body": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil will reinstate a mining ban in a vast area of the Amazon rainforest, the government announced on Monday, in an about-face that is a victory for environmentalists who feared deforestation.\n\nThe Mines and Energy Ministry said in a statement that President Michel Temer\u2019s administration had decided to revoke an August decree abolishing the National Reserve of Copper and Associates (Renca), an area of roughly 17,800 square miles (46,100 square kilometers) or slightly larger than Denmark.\n\nThe decision will be published in the Official Gazette on Tuesday, officials said.\n\nThe reserve in the northern states of Amap\u00e1 and Par\u00e1 was established in 1984 to protect what are thought to be significant deposits of gold, copper, iron ore and other minerals from the perceived threat of foreign miners at the time.\n\nThe reserve covers a section of the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest rainforest, the preservation of which is seen as essential to soaking up carbon emissions responsible for global warming.\n\nThe government said it would revisit the issue in the future in a wider debate on the issue. \u201cBrazil needs to grow and create jobs, attract mining investment and even tap the economic potential of the region),\u201d the ministry statement said.\n\nThe government had argued that lifting the ban would be a boon to the economy and would allow better oversight of the area estimated to have 1,000 people illegally mining there.\n\nMining and Energy Minister Fernando Coelho Filho and other officials have maintained that the reserve merely applied to mining and that other protections for conservation areas and indigenous land inside Renca would remain.\n\nBut environmentalists argued that merely building roads or infrastructure in the area would bring deforestation and threaten biodiversity, with Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen tweeting against the decree.\n\n\u201cIf carried out, the cancellation of the decree shows that, no matter how bad, there is no leader absolutely immune to public pressures,\u201d Marcio Astrini, coordinator of public policy for environmental group Greenpeace, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is a victory of society over those who want to destroy and sell our forest.\u201d\n\nThe government had steadily backtracked in the face of the criticism, legal action and efforts to overturn the decree in Congress. A judge also granted an injunction blocking the decree."
