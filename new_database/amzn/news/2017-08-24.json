        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Marvel and DC Comics superheroes may be battling for box office domination, but on the small screen, a little known blue superhero is offering up a satirical take on larger-than-life crusaders for justice.\n\n\u201cThe Tick,\u201d a new Amazon Studios series premiering on Friday, follows the adventures of eccentric superhero The Tick, a man in a blue spandex suit with feelers sticking out of his head who has no memory of his own origins.\n\nHe and his bumbling sidekick Arthur fight incompetently against strange villains like Ramses IV, Ms. Lint, The Terror and Overkill, while encountering respected superheroes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s set in the real world where superheroes exist. I\u2018m also a superhero, but even the superheroes think I\u2018m weird,\u201d actor Peter Serafinowicz said in an interview of playing The Tick.\n\nSuperheroes have saturated Hollywood in recent years, including Disney-owned Marvel\u2019s 2008 action \u201cIron Man\u201d and Warner Bros rebooting the DC Universe with Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman.\n\nOn television, shows such as \u201cGotham,\u201d \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Defenders\u201d have offered a more in-depth take on superhero stories.\n\nThe Tick, created by cartoonist Ben Edlund in 1986, has had two previous iterations on television, in a 1994 animated series and in a 2001 live-action series. The story has \u201calways been in dialogue with whatever has been big in superhero pop culture at the time,\u201d said actor Griffin Newman, who plays Arthur."

        "body": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Wednesday cleared two of the biggest hurdles it needed to close its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O, with approvals from a U.S. regulator and the grocery chain\u2019s shareholders.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in a statement it would not pursue its investigation into the proposed merger further after reviewing whether the deal would substantially lessen competition or constituted an unfair method of competition.\n\nAmazon said it was on track to close the merger, expected sometime this year. Earlier on Wednesday, Whole Foods said its shareholders voted in favor of the deal.\n\nBuying Whole Foods gives the world\u2019s largest online retailer a foothold in the $700 billion U.S. grocery market, key for it to grab a greater share of shoppers\u2019 wallets. It also gives Amazon more than 465 brick-and-mortar stores where it could showcase products and ready packages for home delivery.\n\nThe marriage between the online retailer and the pioneer organic grocery seller has sent shockwaves through the supermarket industry, already in the midst of a price war.\n\nMuch larger grocers like Kroger Co (KR.N), with 2,796 retail food stores, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) are racing to add online shopping options so they do not give ground to Amazon. Meanwhile, they are being forced to discount items as German grocery chains Aldi and Lidl expand in the United States.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely under pressure,\u201d said eMarketer analyst Patricia Orsini. Without \u201csome sort of e-commerce strategy... you\u2019re going to lose those shoppers to a competitor.\u201d\n\nAmazon has a loyal and spendthrift following thanks to its shopping club Prime. However, its decade-long effort to deliver groceries to customers\u2019 homes has been unable to unseat brick-and-mortar rivals.\n\n\u201cPrime members are keen to learn the benefits of a bricks-and-mortar approach to Amazon Grocery,\u201d said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian.\n\n\u201cThe deal will close after they sort out more \u2018back office\u2019 issues,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhole Foods shares rose 0.7 percent in after-hours trading to $41.96, still shy of the deal\u2019s $42 per-share price tag. Amazon shares dipped 0.4 percent, while shares of Kroger and Wal-Mart were largely unchanged.\n\nAntitrust experts had expected the deal to win government approval because Amazon sells few groceries currently and Whole Foods itself makes up a small fraction of U.S. food sales.\n\nSome critics, however, had argued that the government could attempt to block the merger since Amazon might leverage its retail and supply chain power to dominate a new market.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t normally see cases on theories that are speculative,\u201d said Richard Feinstein, who headed the FTC\u2019s bureau of competition under former President Barack Obama.\n\nThat has not stopped some in political office from questioning the merger.\n\nLast month, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee voiced concerns about the plan and sought a hearing to look into the deal\u2019s impact on consumers.\n\nAmazon has frequently been in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who last week took aim at the company over taxes and jobs, without offering evidence. The retailer\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post, which Trump has also frequently criticized.\n\n\u201cAmazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. Trump made no mention of the pending Whole Foods purchase.\n\nThe FTC opted not to make a second request for information about the deal, which is often a burden for companies that have to provide extensive information that can drain time and resources to collect. Such requests have in the past led to concessions so a merger gains government approval.\n\n\u201cThe FTC quickly decided that the combination did not create a significant danger of lessening competition in any market,\u201d Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan, said.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, a group that had urged the FTC to take action to block the merger, said in a statement it was disappointed. \u201cApparently the only way to hold Amazon accountable for its abuse of consumers is at the state level,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe government could step in after the deal closes if Amazon were ever found to undermine competition illegally, according to Gordon and Feinstein. The FTC also said on Wednesday that it \u201calways has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.\u201d"
