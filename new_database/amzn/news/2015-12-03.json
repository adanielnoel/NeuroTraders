        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Brazil\u2019s attorney general has asked the supreme court to uphold the closure of Brazilian mining company Vale SA\u2019s On\u00e7a Puma nickel mine for allegedly failing to meet the terms of its environmental license, the prosecutor said on Wednesday.\n\nAttorney General Rodrigo Janot made the request in response to a petition by the state of Par\u00e1 to reopen the mine, ordered closed in August, on the grounds that the shutdown puts 850 jobs at risk and threatens the region\u2019s economy, according to a statement from his office.\n\nLocated in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region, On\u00e7a Puma produced 5,900 tonnes of nickel in the third quarter, or 8.2 pct of production at Vale, the world\u2019s largest nickel producer.\n\nRio de Janeiro-based Vale allegedly failed to mitigate mine impacts and compensate the Catet\u00e9 and Kaiap\u00f3 native groups for the intrusion on their way of life, as required under an operating license granted in 2004, the attorney general said.\n\n\u201cIn the balance of values, life takes priority over eventual economic losses stemming from the stoppage of the project,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nAt the same time, the prosecutor said, rivers \u201cwere seriously contaminated by heavy metals such as iron, copper, nickel, chrome and other bio-accumulative metals with serious risks to human health.\u201d\n\nVale officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe petition comes as Vale and its 50-50 joint-venture partner in Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o SA, Australia\u2019s BHP Billiton Ltd , face a 20 billion real ($5.21 billion) lawsuit from Brazilian government agencies for damages related to a deadly November dam-burst at Samarco\u2019s iron ore mine in Minas Gerais state.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vale\u2019s non-ferrous metals chief, Jennifer Maki told investors in New York that while Vale had stopped all mining at On\u00e7a Puma\u2019s open-pit nickel mine in Brazil\u2019s Carajas region, it was still operating the its ferro-nickel processing plant at the site.\n\nVale has said it is in full compliance with the court-ordered shutdown. Processing of ores to separate pure metal from other elements such as oxygen chemically bonded to them is the principal source of toxic impacts from mining.\n\nVale has said efforts to comply with the license have been blocked by native groups\u2019 refusal to open native land to researchers to assess mine impacts and to calculate compensation.\n\nAmazon rivers have also suffered from unregulated wildcat gold mining leaving many contaminated with heavy metals."
