        "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai\u2019s Emaar Malls, operator of glitzy Middle East shopping centers, has made an $800 million offer for regional online retailer Souq.com [IPO-SOUQ.DU], setting up a potential bidding war with Amazon.com.\n\nEmaar Malls\u2019 bid has so far not been accepted by Souq.com shareholders, the Dubai-listed firm said in a stock exchange announcement on Monday.\n\nReuters reported last week that Amazon had agreed in principle to buy Souq.com, which was founded 12 years ago by Syrian-born entrepreneur Ronaldo Mouchawar.\n\nAmazon declined to comment, and Souq.com did not respond to an emailed request for further comment.\n\nHowever, Emaar Malls\u2019 offer is higher than Amazon\u2019s $580 million bid, a source familiar with the matter said. The Financial Times reported Amazon would pay between $650 and $750 million, quoting two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nHowever, Souq.com will have to break an exclusivity agreement with Amazon if it is to accept the Emaar Malls offer at this stage, the source said.\n\nThe Emaar Malls bid includes a $500 million up-front payment and a guaranteed 15 per cent internal rate of return for Souq.com shareholders, the source said.\n\nA successful bid would give Emaar \u201ca firmer footing in retail and consumer behavior,\u201d said Sanyalaksna Manibhandu, head of research at NBAD Securities.\n\nThe offer is not the first move online to be made by Dubai billionaire Mohamed Alabbar, who made his name as chairman of Emaar Properties, the Dubai-government linked-developer of the world\u2019s tallest building. Emaar Malls is the retail unit of Emaar Properties.\n\nLast year Alabbar raised $1 billion from regional investors including Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund to set up his own Middle East e-commerce firm Noon.\n\nDays before announcing Noon, Alabbar and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos met in Dubai, leading to speculation that they would forge some sort of partnership in the region.\n\nOriginally set to open for business with 20 million products, Noon quietly missed its January launch date. The company has yet to comment on the delay.\n\nEmaar Malls bid is independent of Noon, the source said, aimed at complementing the retail unit\u2019s brick-and-mortar sales by introducing services such as \u201cclick and collect\u201d. Shoppers in the Arab world prefer to make purchases in-store despite a young and tech-savvy population.\n\nEmaar Malls is the operator of the Dubai Mall, which accounts for around 50 percent of the emirate\u2019s luxury goods spending and is one of the Middle East\u2019s largest shopping centers.\n\n\u201cEmaar\u2019s retail division will strengthen the case for online retail for traditional brick and mortar retailers, by providing an avenue of online retail,\u201d Euromonitor research analyst Rabia Yasmeen said in an email.\n\nAlabbar has also made other investments in new technology and e-commerce - buying a stake in regional logistics firm Aramex last year and is in the process of setting up a high-end Middle East online fashion retailer with Yoox Net-a-Porter after buying a 4 percent stake in the Italian-based online retailer for 100 million euros last April.\n\nAlabbar has said he plans to use Aramex and Kuwait Food Co (Americana), another company he bought into last year, to deliver Noon products.\n\nHe also has plans to develop a Middle East phone messaging service similar to Facebook Inc\u2019s popular Whatsapp.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Naspers Ltd, which has said it holds a 36.4 percent stake in Souq.com, declined to comment.
