The stock was the second biggest drag on the S&P and the Nasdaq.\n\nGeneral Motors jumped 2.5 percent, while Ford slipped 2.5 percent after the automakers gave contrasting profit forecasts for the year.\n\nMetlife was up 6 percent at $44.71 after the biggest U.S. life insurer said it plans to separate a large part of its retail business.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is scheduled to release its budget report for December at 2 p.m.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,590 to 1,329. On the Nasdaq, 1,554 issues fell and 1,074 advanced.\n\nThe S&P 500 index showed two new 52-week highs and 21 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded six new highs and 181 new lows.
