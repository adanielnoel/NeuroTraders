        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Brazilian government program to formally distribute land to thousands of small-scale farmers is helping the country protect its vast forests, according to research presented to lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Legal Land Programme has distributed more than 20,000 property title deeds to farmers in the Amazon rainforest in Latin America\u2019s largest country.\n\nIndependent analysis of the program based on satellite maps and government data, shows that land where title deeds had been distributed had 2 percent more forest left intact compared with territory lacking in titles.\n\n\u201cThe program is an effective way to reduce deforestation,\u201d said Dimitri Szerman, a senior analyst with the Climate Policy Initiative research group in Rio de Janeiro, which carried out the analysis.\n\nTwo percent might sound small, but against high rates of deforestation, it was significant, said Szerman, who presented the findings of his research to government officials in the capital Brasilia on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere is no silver bullet on deforestation,\u201d Szerman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cTwo percent is actually an aggressive result.\u201d\n\nBrazil, which is home to the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest tropical forest, is losing the equivalent of two soccer fields of forest each minute, according to the former head of the country\u2019s forestry service.\n\nAfter years of declines, the rate of deforestation shot up by 29 percent last year compared to 2015, according to Brazil\u2019s National Space Research Institute (INPE).\n\nAnalysts say a lack of property rights has fueled the recent increase in deforestation.\n\nVacant lands and public areas which are not officially owned by anyone, make up more than one fifth of Brazil\u2019s total area, according to the Climate Policy Initiative.\n\nThese lands are often illegally occupied by individuals or investors, said Szerman.\n\n\u201cIn the long-term you need to solve the problem of property rights to bring down deforestation,\u201d Szerman said."

        "body": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos said on Wednesday he is selling about $1 billion worth of the internet retailer\u2019s stock annually to fund his Blue Origin rocket company, which aims to launch paying passengers on 11-minute space rides starting next year.\n\nBlue Origin had hoped to begin test flights with company pilots and engineers in 2017, but that probably will not happen until next year, Bezos told reporters at the annual U.S. Space Symposium in Colorado Springs.\n\n\u201cMy business model right now \u2026 for Blue Origin is I sell about $1 billion of Amazon stock a year and I use it to invest in Blue Origin,\u201d said Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and also the owner of The Washington Post newspaper.\n\nUltimately, the plan is for Blue Origin to become a profitable, self-sustaining enterprise, with a long-term goal to cut the cost of space flight so that millions of people can live and work off Earth, Bezos said.\n\nBezos is Amazon\u2019s largest shareholder, with 80.9 million shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. At Wednesday\u2019s closing share price of $909.28, Bezos would have to sell 1,099,771 shares to meet his pledge of selling $1 billion worth of Amazon stock. Bezos\u2019 total Amazon holdings, representing a 16.95 percent stake in the company, are worth $73.54 billion at Wednesday\u2019s closing price.\n\nFor now, Kent, Washington-based Blue Origin is working toward far shorter hops - 11 minute space rides that are not fast enough to put a spaceship into orbit around Earth.\n\nBlue Origin has not started selling tickets or set prices to ride aboard its six-passenger, gumdrop-shaped capsule, known as New Shepard.\n\nThe reusable rocket and capsule is designed to carry passengers to an altitude of more than 100 miles (62 km) above the planet so they can experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of Earth set against the blackness of space. Unmanned test flights have been underway since 2015.\n\nAt the symposium, Bezos showed off a mockup of the passenger capsule, which sports six reclined seats, each with its own large window. Also on display was a scorched New Shepard booster rocket that was retired in October after five flights.\n\nLike fellow tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of SpaceX, Bezos says that reusability is the key to cutting the cost of space flight. Last week, SpaceX re-launched a rocket for an unprecedented second mission to put a spacecraft into orbit.\n\n\u201cThe engineering approach is a little different, but we\u2019re very like-minded,\u201d Bezos said of Musk.\n\nBlue Origin is developing a second launch system to carry satellites, and eventually people, into orbit, similar to SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule.\n\nDevelopment costs for that system, known as New Glenn, will be about $2.5 billion.\n\nThere is no estimate yet for how much Bezos will invest overall on Blue Origin. But Bezos has indicated he will spend what it takes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long road to get there and I\u2019m happy to invest in it,\u201d Bezos said.\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Bezos has a net worth of $78 billion."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Hydrogen fuel cell maker Plug Power Inc (PLUG.O) said on Wednesday Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) had acquired the right to buy up to 23 percent of the company and that it would supply batteries to power forklifts used by the online retailer in its warehouses.\n\nPlug Power\u2019s shares closed 73 percent higher at $2.25 in heavy trading. Amazon shares rose as much as 1.9 percent to a record high of $923.72 before ending 0.3 percent higher at $909.28.\n\nLatham, New York-based Plug Power was valued at $319 million as of Tuesday\u2019s market close. Amazon must spend at least $600 million over the life of its contract with Plug Power for its warrants to fully vest.\n\nAmazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, will equip forklifts at 11 warehouses this year with hydrogen fuel cells so they can lift more goods before running out of juice, as well as charge faster, Plug Power\u2019s Chief Executive Andy Marsh said in an interview. Amazon will spend $70 million on the deal in 2017 and likely twice that next year, he said.\n\n\u201cFulfillment centers are traditionally fairly low tech,\u201d said Marsh, explaining that labor as well as physical space could be freed up by moving away from batteries requiring lots of attention.\n\nAmazon\u2019s deal with Plug Power could rekindle interest in makers of fuel cell companies, including Ballard Power Systems Inc (BLDP.TO) and Hydrogenics Corp (HYG.TO), whose shares were up about 6 percent.\n\nFuel cell makers had become Wall Street darlings in 2014 as their technology was expected to be widely adopted in electric vehicles and forklifts.\n\nHowever, the sector has lost favor with investors as the technology failed to gain traction.\n\nPlug Power itself has lost more than two-thirds of its market value since the first quarter of 2014, when it was valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nRaymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov described the deal as one of the occasional bright spots that highlighted the potential for growth in the fuel cell industry.\n\nPlug Power\u2019s narrow focus of powering forklifts with fuel cells, essentially makes the company the only player in the market, Molchanov said.\n\nWhile only a tiny fraction of forklifts globally are powered by hydrogen fuel, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) already uses the company\u2019s technology in its warehouses and is a top customer, Plug Power\u2019s Marsh said.\n\nThe retailer is locked in a fight with Amazon for share of U.S. shoppers\u2019 wallets."
