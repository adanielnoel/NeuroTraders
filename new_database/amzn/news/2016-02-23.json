        "body": "LIMA (Reuters) - Ruptures in Peru\u2019s main oil pipeline have spilled 3,000 barrels of crude in an Amazonian region, operator Petroperu said Monday, and the oil has polluted two rivers native villages rely on for water, according to government officials.\n\nTwo breaks in the pipeline have halted transportation of 5,000 to 6,000 barrels of oil per day, state-owned Petroperu said.\n\nThe oil has poured into the Chiriaco and Morona rivers in northwestern Peru, said national environmental regulator OEFA. At least eight native Achuar communities rely on the rivers for water, said Edwin Montenegro, a local indigenous leader.\n\nPeru\u2019s health ministry declared a water quality emergency in five districts near the spill.\n\nState-owned Petroperu faces some 60 million soles ($17 million) in fines if tests confirm that the spills, in late January and early February, hurt the health of locals, said OEFA.\n\nIt could take \u201csome time\u201d to resume operations, said Petroperu president German Velasquez.\n\nPetroperu operates the pipeline and also refines the oil it transports, which had slowed in recent months to between 5,000 and 6,000 barrels per day amid slumping oil prices. The pipeline mostly transports crude from block 192, operated by Pacific Exploration & Production Corp.\n\nHeavy rains upended Petroperu\u2019s initial efforts to contain the damage as oil burst from retaining walls and spread into nearby rivers, said Montenegro.\n\nTV images showed thickets of jungle sopped in black sludge and clean-up crews lifting buckets of crude from rivers.\n\nVelasquez said a landslide likely triggered the first leak but the cause of the second rupture was unclear.\n\nThe spills come as Petroperu has been preparing to take part in oil production with a private partner after more than two decades of mostly refining, commercializing and transporting crude. The company had also planned to put up to 49 percent of its actions on the Lima stock exchange.\n\nOEFA ordered Petroperu to replace parts of the pipeline and improve maintenance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the spills...are not isolated cases. Similar emergencies have emerged as a result of defects in sections of the pipeline,\u201d OEFA said in a statement.\n\nVelasquez said the company was conducting an evaluation of the pipeline, built in the 70s, to prevent any future spills, a process that could take up to two months.\n\nHe denied reports the company paid children to clean up the oil but said he was evaluating firing four officials, including one who may have allowed children to collect the crude.\n\nHe said neither Petroperu or Pacific have declared force majeure - a clause in contracts which frees parties from obligations or liabilities due to an unavoidable accident or occurrence. Pacific did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

        "body": "(Reuters) - A federal appeals court endorsed a Colorado law designed to make it easier for the state to collect sales taxes on out-of-state purchases made over the Internet.\n\nMonday\u2019s decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed a lower court ruling that blocked Colorado from enforcing its so-called \u201cAmazon tax\u201d law, named for online retailer Amazon.com Inc.\n\nThe decision is a victory for states seeking to boost revenue by ensuring that online shoppers pay taxes.\n\nIt is a defeat for the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group that challenged the 2010 law, and which a year ago won U.S. Supreme Court permission to pursue its case.\n\nThe law requires retailers that do not collect sales taxes to report transactions to customers and state tax authorities, with a goal of encouraging online shoppers - many unaware of their responsibilities - to pay taxes.\n\nIn court papers, Colorado said the failure to pay cost more than $170 million of tax revenue in 2012, and law professors said the nationwide shortfall might top $11 billion.\n\nThe DMA claimed that the law violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nA federal district judge agreed in 2012, citing a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that barred states from collecting taxes from retailers that had no local physical presence.\n\nBut in Monday\u2019s decision, Circuit Judge Scott Matheson said that 1992 ruling, Quill Corp v North Dakota, applied \u201cnarrowly\u201d to tax collections, and that the district judge was wrong to extend its reach to reporting obligations.\n\n\u201cReporting requirements are designed to increase compliance with pre-existing tax obligations,\u201d Matheson wrote. \u201cDMA has not shown the Colorado law imposes a discriminatory economic burden on out-of-state vendors.\u201d\n\nChristopher Oswald, the DMA\u2019s vice president of advocacy, said his group is reviewing the decision, which upheld requirements that \u201cunduly break the bond of trust between marketers and their customers.\u201d\n\nColorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman called the decision an \u201cimportant victory\u201d that will make tax collection easier and help \u201clevel the economic playing field\u201d for in-state businesses.\n\nThe 10th Circuit includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Amazon now charges sales tax on purchases by Colorado residents.\n\nLast March, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that federal courts could hear the DMA\u2019s challenge, while Justice Anthony Kennedy in a concurrence called for the Quill ruling to be reconsidered.\n\nKennedy said Internet retailing has caused a \u201cstartling revenue shortfall in many States, with concomitant unfairness to local retailers and their customers who do pay taxes at the register.\u201d\n\nThe case is Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-1175."
