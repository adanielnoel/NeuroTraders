Yorkshire pudding is made from batter, and is a staple of the traditional British roast dinner.\n\nLocal legend has it that the tradition sprang from the War of the Roses in the 15th century, when combatants from the warring Houses of Lancaster and York resorted to throwing food at each other after exhausting their supply of ammunition.\n\n\u201cThere is more military connections with the black pudding lobbing than anything else,\u201d contest organizer Phil Taylor said.\n\n\u201cIn the First World War, Kitchener (then Britain\u2019s Secretary of State for War) valued the people from Stubbins and Ramsbottom for their ability to lob the new Mills bomb - the hand grenade.\u201d\n\nThe modern contest requires competitors to stand on a painted house brick, dubbed the golden grid block, and throw their black puddings at a 20-foot (six-meter) high plinth mounted on a scaffold, topped with several Yorkshire puddings.\n\nThis year\u2019s contest, held over the weekend, saw a new champion crowned, 45-year-old Nick Pennell from Wolverhampton, who managed to knock down five of the light Yorkshire delicacies.\n\nPennell described himself as being \u201celated\u201d with his victory. \u201cWords can\u2019t express how happy I am to win this trophy.\u201d"
