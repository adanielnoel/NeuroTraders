However, he urged customers to pre-order the device early.\n\n\u201cWhen Bezos quipped that people should get their pre-orders in quick, that wasn\u2019t just a sales pitch,\u201d said Brian Blair, an analyst at Wedge Partners. \u201cThat was him warning this will sell out.\u201d\n\nWhen the first Kindle came out in 2007, Amazon hadn\u2019t made enough and the e-reader sold out in less than a week. That meant the company missed out on sales and got the device into fewer customers\u2019 hands, limiting quick adoption.\n\n\u201cI hope they learned their lesson from the last time,\u201d said Vinita Jakhanwal, an analyst at IHS iSuppli, which tracks electronic component supply chains.\n\nAmazon spokeswomen didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nAmazon has lined up about four to five million screens for the Fire in the fourth quarter, which is a \u201cfairly significant\u201d amount, Jakhanwal added.\n\nHowever, the technology that is being used for the Fire\u2019s screen has been around for at least a year and already has been produced in high volume, reducing the chances of supply shortages, Jakhanwal said.\n\nOne of the components that was in shorter supply in the first half of 2011 was the 10-inch screen, mostly because of the iPad, according to Bradley Gastwirth of technology research firm ABR Investment Strategy.\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the main reasons why Amazon started off at the 7-inch form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, other specialized components may be in short supply and that could limit how many Kindle Fire\u2019s can be made quickly, Jakhanwal said.\n\nOther components aren\u2019t known yet, according to Wedge\u2019s Blair. But he expects a re-run of 2007, with the Fire selling out quickly.\n\nColin Sebastian, an analyst at RW Baird, kept his Amazon tablet sales forecasts the same on Wednesday on concern about potential supply issues. He expects two million to three million units to be sold this year and four to six million next year.\n\nAmazon has better data on consumer demand and supply chains than it did in 2007, said Scott Devitt, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cBut the $199 price point could drive heavy demand, so supply issues are possible and something to consider,\u201d he added.\n\nPart of Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) success with the iPad and other products was driven by the company\u2019s tight control of its supply chain, which ensured it got enough parts before rivals.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s supply chain, production and distribution capabilities provide a competitive advantage over Amazon, which may find it difficult to produce more than a few million Kindle Fires for the holiday season,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at PiperJaffray.\n\nThe Fire\u2019s $199 price has Munster and others concerned about profit margins at Amazon too.\n\nAmazon always competes aggressively on price, often sucking up losses when it enters new markets. The company is currently branching out in several new areas and its profit margins have suffered.\n\nApple enjoys gross profit margins over 30 percent on the iPad. That\u2019s partly because the company offers digital content cheaply to promote purchases of such devices. In contrast, Munster estimated that Amazon will probably lose about $50 on each Kindle Fire it sells.\n\nAnthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital, expects Amazon\u2019s pro-forma operating profit margin to be 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, down 160 basis points from a year earlier.\n\nStill, Amazon hopes to make up any losses on the Kindle Fire through extra purchases of the company\u2019s other products and services made by users of the device.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Devitt cites the example of ebooks. The Kindle Fire may increase purchases of digital books, hastening the demise of physical bookstores, he explained.\n\nThat would \u201clead to an industry with fewer merchants and thus higher long-term margins,\u201d Devitt said.

        "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Asian technology companies came under pressure on Thursday to slash prices of their tablet computers after Amazon.com launched its Kindle Fire at a mass market-friendly $199.\n\nFrom Samsung Electronics to Sony Corp, major Asian tablet makers have ambitious plans to take on Apple, whose iPad is the gold standard in the booming market.\n\nWith their me-too type of products priced almost at the same level as the iPad\u2019s starting price of $499, none of them have however been able to gain any significant market share from Apple.\n\nSo far, Samsung has been seen as the most credible challenger to the iPad and some analysts suggest it could lose its No. 2 position to the eagerly anticipated Fire.\n\nThe South Korean company\u2019s tablet marketing campaign has also stumbled in recent months due to Apple\u2019s legal attempts to ban Samsung\u2019s tablet sales in Australia, the United States and Germany, over patent infringement, among other claims.\n\nThe Kindle Fire, while lacking many of the high-tech bells and whistles common on tablets from cameras to 3G wireless connection, may sound the death knell for a raft of devices based on Google Inc\u2019s Android operating system.\n\n\u201cThe pricing is critical to gain traction in the tablet market... Rival manufacturers have failed to attract consumers as they have matched the iPad\u2019s price point without matching its content offering,\u201d said Adam Leach, an analyst at research firm Ovum.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s retail-based business model allows the company to subsidize the device on the premise that consumers will buy more from Amazon, be that physical goods or its digital content.\u201d\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab, Sony\u2019s S tablet, Motorola\u2019s Zoom and many others from Acer Inc and Asustek Computer Inc all run on Android, which Amazon\u2019s Fire also uses and combines with its online store.\n\nBy pricing the Fire at less than half the iPad -- yet stripping out costlier components and features -- the Internet retailer hopes to get the device into millions of consumers\u2019 hands and then into Amazon books, movies, music and other content.\n\nSamsung\u2019s new tablet Galaxy 10.1 is priced roughly the same as the iPad. Even at that price, a slim profit margin of around 5 percent makes it difficult for Samsung to cut prices sharply, analysts say.\n\nWorldwide tablet shipments will more than triple to 60 million units this year and surge to 275.3 million units by 2015, research firm IHS iSuppli forecasts.\n\nApple dominates the North American tablet market, with 80 percent of the 7.5 million units shipped during the second quarter of 2011, Strategy Analytics says.\n\nAnalysts had expected Amazon\u2019s tablet to be priced around $250, roughly half the price of Apple\u2019s iPad, which starts at $499.\n\nSony vowed in January to become the world\u2019s No. 2 tablet maker -- behind Apple -- by 2012 and Sony executives have since stuck to that ambitious claim.\n\n\u201cWe expect the Amazon tablet to... put pressure on the other non-iPad competitors as they are unlikely to be able to compete on price and value,\u201d UBS analysts said in a note.\n\n\u201cAt the $199, we believe Amazon\u2019s tablet has the potential to be disruptive to the market and, in particular, the non-iPad market...Other tablet vendors will find it difficult to match Amazon\u2019s price point.\u201d\n\nHP\u2019s firesale of its TouchPad tablet at $99 just six weeks after its launch created strong demand for its soon-to-be-killed product, a sign of just how critical prices are in the sector."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) took the wraps off its long-awaited \u201cKindle Fire\u201d on Wednesday, tacking on a mass market-friendly $199 price tag that poses a serious threat to the dominance of Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) two-year-old iPad.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated gadget, while lacking many of the high-tech bells and whistles common on tablets from cameras to 3G wireless connection, may sound the death knell for a raft of devices based on Google Inc\u2019s (GOOG.O) Android. The software powers tablets made by Samsung (005930.KS), Motorola (MMI.N), Asustek (2357.TW), HTC (2498.TW) and LG Electronics (066570.KS).\n\nDotcom-entrepreneur and billionaire-CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled to a packed audience the gadget he hopes will wed Amazon\u2019s books, movies, music and other content with cloud or Internet-based storage and Web browsing.\n\n\u201cPeople have been waiting for a tablet for 200 bucks for a long time and this is the best one I\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Tim Stevens, editor-in-chief of gadget review website Engadget, told Reuters.\n\nThe Kindle Fire tablet has a 7-inch screen, free data storage over the Internet and a new browser called Amazon Silk. Amazon expects shipments to start on November 15 -- hitting store shelves at Best Buy (BBY.N) and other chains just in time for the peak holiday shopping season.\n\nBy pricing the Fire at less than half the iPad -- yet stripping out costlier components and features -- the Internet retailer hopes to get the device into millions of consumers\u2019 hands, who in turn will buy Amazon content.\n\nOne key differentiator that might help the Fire stand out during the cut-throat holidays is Amazon\u2019s \u201cEC2\u201d cloud computing service, which supports Internet browsing and helps speed loading of websites. That was not available on rival tablets, Stevens noted.\n\n\u201cExpect a blood bath as pricing will have to get extremely aggressive,\u201d said Mark Gerber, an analyst at Detwiler Fenton & Co. He expects Amazon to sell at least 3 million Kindle Fires this holiday season, taking the No. 2 spot in the tablet market.\n\nThe Fire was unveiled alongside several rock-bottom-priced versions of the basic Kindle reader, with the lowest at $79 -- a clear challenge to Barnes & Noble Inc\u2019s Nook that will surely force the ailing bookstore chain to try and match.\n\n\u201cThese are premium products at non-premium prices,\u201d Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said. \u201cWe are going to sell millions of these.\u201d\n\nAnalysts had expected Amazon\u2019s tablet to be priced around $250, roughly half the price of Apple\u2019s dominant iPad, which starts at $499. The Nook Color e-reader costs $249.\n\nThe Web retailer might be angling for a lower-end slice of the market that Apple -- which maintains a careful grip over its higher-end branding and margins -- has traditionally steered clear of.\n\nBezos said Amazon is making \u201cmillions\u201d of the tablet, without being more specific. However, he urged customers to pre-order the device.\n\nWhen the original Kindle e-reader came out in 2007, it quickly sold out.\n\nColin Sebastian, an analyst at RW Baird, kept his Amazon tablet sales forecasts the same on Wednesday on concern about potential supply issues. He expects two million to three million units to be sold this year and four to six million next year.\n\n\u201cWhile we think the Kindle Fire could easily be the most successful Android-based tablet to date, the November 15 launch date, and the possibility of issues with ramping production -- Apple encountered significant production issues with the iPad 2 -- are the key reasons we are maintaining our current tablet estimates.\u201d\n\nBreaking into a crowded tablet market will be difficult. Companies from Hewlett Packard Co (HPQ.N), Motorola, Samsung and Research in Motion Ltd RIM.TO have launched tablets, but none has taken a big bite out of Apple\u2019s lead.\n\nApple dominates the North American tablet market, with 80 percent of the 7.5 million units shipped during the second quarter of 2011, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nBezos took a jab at its larger rival during the New York press conference on Wednesday, noting that the Fire needs no wires for syncing. An image of a white USB cord appeared on the screen behind him, prompting laughter from the crowd.\n\nBezos didn\u2019t mention Apple but the picture of the cord resembled those commonly used to connect iPhones and iPads to computers.\n\nStill, Michael Yoshikami, who oversees $1 billion at YCMNET Advisors, discounted any serious hit to Apple -- for now -- because of Apple\u2019s similarly rich library of content.\n\nBut he thought Apple may need to start offering some sort of subscription-based video streaming service -- iTunes is download primarily -- to respond. Rivals without their own content or services to support their devices, such as Samsung, are most exposed, he added.\n\n\u201cHP\u2019s decision to get out of tablets is actually looking fairly bright,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nHaving its own tablet is important for Amazon because the company has amassed a mountain of digital goods and services that could be sold through such a device.\n\nThe tablet might also encourage customers of Amazon, the world's largest Internet retailer, to shop online for physical products more often. (link.reuters.com/xab24s)\n\nAmazon recently redesigned its main shopping website to make it easier to navigate for mobile users.\n\n\u201cGetting this device into the hands of customers means Amazon can expand their e-commerce footprint -- this is a strategic focus for the company,\u201d said Eric Best, an Amazon veteran who now runs online commerce company Mercent.\n\n\u201cEvery Kindle Fire user, by virtue of the better browser and richer operating system, has the potential to become a more frequent Amazon shopper.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, competition at the high end of the market is heating up. Motorola on Wednesday announced it will offer 4G-LTE upgrades for Motorola Xoom users on Verizon Wireless, improving loading speeds.

        "body": "That was the week that was.\n\nI can imagine saying that in years to come about the eight days that began on Wednesday with Amazon\u2019s paradigm-busting entry into the tablet business, its deeper walk into the cheaper e-ink e-reader woods with less expensive Kindles, bookended next Wednesday by Apple\u2019s latest iPhone(s) reveal.\n\nBoth unveilings have lots to do with \u201ceverywhere\u201d consumption, and both have aspects of evolution. But a counter-revolution began this week, and we\u2019ll be talking about for years to come.\n\nDare I say it: Amazon\u2019s $199 \u201cFire\u201d tablet may not make us forget Apple\u2019s tablet, but it could very well be the first credible answer to the question: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I buy an iPad?\u201d\n\nIt helps that this device comes from a very credible source. Amazon pretty much invented the e-book business. Before that, it sold lots of print books (still does). But the vision and seeming conflict that didn\u2019t deter founder and CEO Jeff Bezos from a business then dominated by big box stores, and especially Barnes and Noble, is the same drive that has him now taking on Apple in its strongest suit.\n\nLet\u2019s face it. When you introduce a new tablet there is really only one horseman you are worried about. No offense HP, Samsung, Research in Motion, etc. But that\u2019s the reality of it. The comparison is inevitable, and the only one a consumer cares about.\n\nHP demonstrated that price can matter, when it decided to give up on $500 tablets \u2014 the same price point as the entry-level iPad \u2014 and emptied the shelves at $100.\n\nEnter Amazon, with a $200 tablet that \u2014 no surprises here \u2014 plugs you into their eco-system just as well as Apple does (or aspires to) and Google accomplishes with Android and its hardware partners. So, Amazon Prime customers, who are already one-click, free-two-day-shipping junkies (I speak from personal experience) can stream the somewhat paltry but respectable library of media Amazon offers.\n\nTablets are a big part of the future. While predictions that tablets would kill e-readers turned out to be completely wrong, isn\u2019t it a bit risky to give your own customers a reason not to buy what is probably still the single-most popular e-reader on the planet?\n\nNot to worry, Bezos says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to buy both,\u201d he told Wired\u2018s Steven Levy in a pre-launch interview.\n\nBezos is probably right enough. I was curmudgeonly about the whole device proliferation thing. Not only are two mobile devices the limit \u2014 but appliances, like things which only let you read books, are anathema.\n\nAfter writing that e-reading wasn\u2019t here yet, and reviewing both a Nook and a Kobo, I discovered that e-readers do actually disappear and are so perfectly designed for the single task they perform that, yes, you might want one as well as a tablet and a smartphone. There is actually no better way to read a book. E-ink offer a superior all-around experience than the relevant alternatives, and by that I also mean print media. (Full disclosure: I own a Nook Touch, purchased at full retail, and my main quibble with the Kindle was the hardware keyboard, which with the latest crop is now gone.)\n\nMy e-reader reviews always harped on the price. As an appliance, I argued, one would have to cost something in the neighborhood of $50 for it to be a no brainer, for every student and grandmother and dentist\u2019s office to buy in. Bezos isn\u2019t going that low, but at $80 there should be considerable new interest from the price conscious consumer or tech timid.\n\nAnd what of the new latest iPhone? Apple isn\u2019t even being coy about the subject of their October event this year. But, as usual, the details are skimpy and unconfirmed. Thin would appear to be in, just at the iPad 2 slimmed down. Al Gore, an Apple board member, allowed as there would be more than one new iPhone. There is talk of an even larger display and a different shaped home button. We still don\u2019t know Apple\u2019s commitment to 4G, which is rolling out slowly.\n\nBut the big question is whether Apple\u2019s event, hosted this year for the first time by new CEO Tim Cook, will suck all the air out of the room, the way Apple iPhone and iPad events always do. Or whether, as it seems very likely right now, that we\u2019ll still be talking about Amazon having the most exciting story in a while in hardware.\n\nPhotos, top to bottom: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos holds up the new Kindle Touch at a news conference during the launch of Amazon\u2019s new tablets in New York September 28, 2011.
