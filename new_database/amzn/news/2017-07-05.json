These illegally registered plots are often hotbeds of deforestation.\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest exporter of beef and chicken, the importance of Brazil\u2019s struggle to contain illegal deforestation for livestock extends far beyond rural Amazonian settlements.\n\nIn Boca do Acre, a poor municipality of wooden stilted homes with 28,000 residents, the cattle industry accounts for more than 70 percent of the economy, officials said.\n\nIt\u2019s a reality replicated in towns throughout the Amazon rainforest, often making it difficult for officials to take a hard line enforcing laws on deforestation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for this city to live without cattle,\u201d Josimar Fidelquino, a local government official responsible for environmental monitoring told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The municipality is the largest cattle producer in Amazonas, Brazil\u2019s biggest state, officials said.\n\nThe FrigoAmazonas slaughterhouse employs more than 100 staff. In muddy rubber boots, ripped jeans and cowboy hats, they arrive at the plant in open-air trucks to process 1,200 head of cattle per month. The slaughterhouse produces meat exclusively for the local market in Amazonas State.\n\n\u201cWe know illegal cows are being killed by people in town,\u201d said Fidelquino, adding that authorities are working on schemes to allow more cattle to be raised on smaller chunks of land.\n\nTypically, farmers simply cut down trees on a plot and allow cattle to graze freely, eating plants growing on the scrub land. The same number of cows could be produced on far smaller plots with supplies of hay or other feed, officials said.\n\nThe president of the Boca do Acre Ranchers Union, Paulo Castillo, refused interview requests about slaughterhouses and their adherence to deforestation or land registration rules.\n\nUnder Brazilian law, Amazon land owners must maintain 80 percent of the forest cover on their properties.\n\nSome local farmers and slaughterhouse owners say that expectation is unrealistic; environmentalists say it\u2019s essential.\n\nRegardless, laws on forest preservation and land governance are not well enforced in remote jungle regions, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is like the \u2018Wild West\u2019 was in America,\u201d said Jose Puppim de Oliveira, a professor at Brazil\u2019s Getulio Vargas Foundation university, who studies land politics.\n\n\u201cForest land is considered unproductive, as are the people living there,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nWhile small slaughterhouses like FrigoAmazonas producing for the local market are known to flout environmental laws, they account for a comparatively small part of Amazon deforestation, said University of Wisconsin professor Holly Gibbs.\n\nAbout 90 percent of Brazil\u2019s cattle is processed in slaughterhouses that can export nationally or internationally, Gibbs said, and they are a driver of deforestation.\n\nLarge cattle companies say they are taking the problem seriously by improving their monitoring of suppliers and working with the government and environmentalists to try to keep cattle produced on illegally cleared land out of their supply chains.\n\nBrazil-based JBS (JBSS3.SA), the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, has pledged not to buy cattle from deforested land in the Amazon, said an official at the company which is in the midst of a separate political corruption scandal.\n\n\u201cBuilding a supply chain free from deforestation is a constant challenge for the entire industry,\u201d a JBS official told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.\n\nThe company has been successful in stopping its direct suppliers from deforesting land, the official said, but monitoring indirect suppliers remains a \u201cmajor challenge\u201d.\n\nBrazilian cows are supposed to have two tracking numbers so their origins can be traced by authorities.\n\nThe first is a health registration document known as a GTA - which shows cattle have received the right vaccinations along with information about the animal\u2019s transportation history.\n\nThe second is certification from Brazil\u2019s environment ministry known as a CAR showing that they were raised on legally registered land adhering to forest protection rules.\n\nGTA documents could be the \u201choly grail for ending deforestation\u201d, said Gibbs, by acting as a passport for cattle.\n\nThey could allow cattle to be tracked from birth until death and as they move between farms to trace legality. But the information is not publicly available.\n\nCompanies agree. JBS wants authorities to launch a new \u201cGreen GTA\u201d to allow for better tracking of the origins of cattle. Government officials in Boca do Acre said they had no information about possible improvements to the GTA system.\n\nWithout clear tracking data, ranchers can move cattle from illegal land to legally registered properties just before selling them to slaughterhouses, Gibbs said.\n\nThe border post in Amazonas State, where cattle documents are supposed to be inspected before bovines travel into neighboring Rondonia State, has been shuttered for months, said a cook who works at locked, dusty building. The lack of checks makes it harder for companies to monitor their supply chains.\n\nBack at FriggoAmazonas, slaughterhouse boss Oliveira says more paperwork under an expanded GTA system would make life even more difficult for small farmers.\n\n\u201cMost of the small farmers here don\u2019t have titles or land registration,\u201d Oliveira said. \u201cHow could they get these papers? Some can\u2019t even sign their names.\u201d\n\nTravel support for this reporting was provided by the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ)."
