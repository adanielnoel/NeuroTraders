        "body": "* Dow up 0.22 pct, S&P off 0.04 pct, Nasdaq down 0.25 pct\n\nNEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Friday after data showed the pace of economic growth fell short of expectations and a separate report on consumer sentiment showed a drop from the previous month.\n\nThe Commerce Department said gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent rate, increasing from 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter but shy of estimates for growth of 3 percent.\n\nThe data could raise doubts about the ability of the economy to absorb government spending cuts and higher taxes, and may fuel speculation on the possibility of more Federal Reserve measures to boost growth, or at least keep its current stimulus plans in place.\n\n\u201cWhat we are going to do is just average the fourth quarter and the first quarter and take a look and see the economy is growing way underneath its potential growth rate which keeps the Fed in play to do more quantitative easing,\u201d said John Canally, investment strategist and economist for LPL Financial in Boston.\n\n\u201cThe market has been rallying on the fact the ECB might actually start to do something; if the U.S. market reacts in the same way, that might get the market rallying. If not and they think the Fed\u2019s hands are tied, the market might sell off.\u201d\n\nThe Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment fell to 76.4 from 78.6 in March, although it topped economists\u2019 expectations for 73.2 and improved upon the preliminary April reading of 72.3.\n\nChevron Corp, up 1.1 percent to $119.78, helped lift the Dow and curbed declines on the S&P 500 index, after the second-largest U.S. oil company, posted its first-quarter earnings.\n\nAmazon.com Inc shed 5.6 percent to $259.20 as the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes after revenue growth slowed in the first quarter as the world\u2019s largest Internet retailer struggled overseas, even as margins jumped on lower shipping expenses.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 32.33 points, or 0.22 percent, to 14,733.13. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index shed 0.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,584.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 8.17 points, or 0.25 percent, to 3,281.81.\n\nStarbucks Corp slipped 1.3 percent to $59.74 after the world\u2019s biggest coffee chain reported a quarterly profit that matched Wall Street estimates but its revenue was slightly below expectations.\n\nThe PHLX housing sector index gained 1.3 percent and was on track for its sixth consecutive advance, getting a lift from D.R. Horton Inc and Weyerhaeuser Co after the No. 1 U.S. homebuilder and forest products company reported earnings.\n\nD.R. Horton shares jumped 7.3 percent to $26.31 while Weyerhaeuser gained 0.8 percent to $31.63.\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters data through Thursday morning, of the 235 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings to date for Q1 2013, 67.7 percent have reported earnings above analysts\u2019 expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994 and slightly above the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.\n\nHowever, revenue has been lackluster, with only 41.4 percent having topped analyst forecasts, well below the 62 percent average since 2002 and the 52 percent beat rate for the last four quarters.\n\nAnalysts now see earnings growth of 3.6 percent this quarter, up from expectations of 1.5 percent at the start of the month."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s revenue growth slowed in the first quarter as the world\u2019s largest Internet retail struggled overseas, but margins jumped on lower shipping expenses and the expansion of more profitable new businesses.\n\nAmazon shares fell 1.9 percent to $269.43 in after-hours trading on Thursday following the results.\n\n\u201cThe message there is North America was better than expected but international was softer. The question is ... \u2018Is this a reflection of macro trends in Europe, or is there something else going on there?'\u201d said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Tom Forte.\n\nEurope\u2019s lackluster economies are weighing on corporate sales in the region - even for fast-growing e-commerce businesses. EBay Inc, Amazon\u2019s main rival, reported disappointing results last week and noted European weakness.\n\nAmazon\u2019s revenue rose 22 percent to $16.07 billion, propelled by growing sales of digital content, cloud-computing services and gains in its main retail business. But it was a decline from 36 percent growth in the first quarter of 2012.\n\nInternational revenue rose 16 percent in the most-recent quarter, year-over-year, down from a 31 percent growth rate in the same period of 2012.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak was peppered with questions about slowing growth.\n\n\u201cThere is some softness from a macro standpoint that others are seeing,\u201d the CFO said.\n\nAmazon has also struggled to grow in China and the CFO told analysts the company is still in \u201cinvestment mode\u201d in that country.\n\nSzkutak reported that total year-over-year unit growth, which measures the number of items Amazon sells, was 30 percent in the first quarter, down from 49 percent in the first quarter of 2012.\n\n\u201cUnit growth is slowing which disappointed some,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. \u201cThe law of large numbers is affecting Amazon too. You can\u2019t grow 100 percent forever, otherwise you become the universe.\u201d\n\nAmazon forecast second-quarter revenue of $14.5 billion to $16.2 billion and operating results from break-even to $350 million. The latter guidance excludes stock-based compensation expenses and other items such as amortization of intangible assets.\n\nWall Street was looking for second-quarter revenue of $15.94 billion and operating results of $452 million, according to Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDespite weaker growth and a cautious forecast, Amazon\u2019s results showed that the company is becoming more profitable.\n\nGross profit margin, a closely watched measure of profitability, came in at a better-than-expected 26.6 percent, compared with 24 percent a year earlier.\n\nThe first-quarter gross margin was the highest in at least a decade, according to Scott Tilghman, an analyst at B Riley & Co.\n\nAmazon is building distribution warehouses closer to customers, reducing shipping costs. It has also been charging third-party merchants on its marketplace higher fees for shipping and warehouse storage.\n\nIn the first quarter, net shipping costs were 4.7 percent of sales, down from 5.1 percent a year earlier.\n\nMoving into other areas is also boosting margins.\n\nThe company mainly operates as a retailer, buying physical products at wholesale prices, storing them and then selling at a slight mark-up to consumers online. But it has expanded into other businesses that are potentially more profitable, including cloud computing, advertising, digital content and acting as an online marketplace for other merchants.\n\nThese newer businesses are growing faster than the company\u2019s original retail operations, boosting profitability.\n\nAmazon\u2019s web services (AWS) and advertising businesses are reported in a segment the company calls \u201cother.\u201d Revenue from this area surged 59 percent to $798 million in the quarter.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, at least on that (profit) basis, they are showing some very good progress,\u201d said Evercore analyst Ken Sena. \u201cYou are seeing benefit from the higher-margin Amazon Web Services business, and also higher-margin third-party marketplace business.\u201d"

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc appears to have figured out the secret to being more profitable: sell less physical stuff.\n\nThe company reported slowing revenue growth and offered a disappointing outlook for this quarter on Thursday, exacerbating uncertainty about the health of its business beyond the United States.\n\nBut that may be masking a fundamental shift in its business on home turf. The Internet retail giant that once specialized in moving books and other physical items quickly is increasingly trying to do the same in the digital world, where profit margins are higher, partly because e-books, music and video files and are transmitted electronically at high speed.\n\nThrow in a fast-expanding third-party merchant business, where Amazon simply books a cut of sales from seller listings on its website, and the retail giant\u2019s margin outlook is looking a lot better.\n\n\u201cOver the long term it does help margins,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put these things on a truck and ship them.\u201d\n\nIn the first quarter, net shipping costs stood at 4.7 percent of sales, down from 5.1 percent a year earlier.\n\nAmazon has been doing all the things a retail business will usually do to goose margins, like putting its distribution closer to customers and charging partners more to ship goods.\n\nBut it has also diversified aggressively into other revenue streams like digital content, advertising and the Amazon Web Services cloud computing business.\n\nIn its news release Thursday, Amazon listed 14 highlights for the first quarter - all but one related to its digital businesses.\n\nChief Executive Jeff Bezos talked about Amazon\u2019s effort to make its own TV shows, which will be delivered over the Internet, rather than in DVD form.\n\nNotably, Amazon\u2019s top-10 selling items in the first quarter were digital goods or Kindle gadgets, which are tablets or e-readers used to buy and consume digital content, Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak told analysts during a conference call.\n\n\u201cThat is the first time that we have seen that,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the short term, the Internet retail giant that started out as a book-retailing business faces several challenges. Its business faces a sluggish European economy and inconsistent efforts to break into emerging markets such as China, where competition from the likes of Alibaba is intense.\n\nAmazon\u2019s shares slid 3 percent to about $267 in Thursday after-hours trade, after executives pointed out the macroeconomic challenges.\n\nBut longer term, analysts say Amazon\u2019s focus on aggressively pushing digital content - such as by selling Kindles at close to cost, undercutting much of the competition - is a winning strategy.\n\nAmazon has largely focused on using price as a lever to get its content in front of more customers.\n\nWhether selling Kindle e-book readers and Kindle Fire tablets cheaply, or bundling on-demand streaming video with subscriptions to other services, Amazon has bet that it can keep people once it has their attention.\n\nLately, it has branched into creating original video content. Last week the company posted 14 pilot TV shows online, intending to let reviews decide which ones it turns into full series.\n\nAmazon has also been gaining on Apple Inc in the digital music business, tripling its market share over the last five years - albeit to a level still just a third of Apple\u2018s.\n\nAt the same time, the company has also made much of its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, which provides data services to a broad range of companies. AWS, as it is commonly known, generated $1.8 billion in revenue last year and is expected to grow rapidly.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, net sales in Amazon\u2019s \u201cother\u201d line, which includes AWS in North America as well as advertising services, rose 59 percent.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that Amazon is really getting leverage from shipping costs. AWS is becoming a big part of their mix. They are also benefiting from a greater mix of advertising revenues. We\u2019ll continue to see that improve,\u201d Topeka Capital\u2019s Victor Anthony said."

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s stock sank 6 percent on Friday as a poor financial outlook revived concerns about whether the company can sustain its torrid pace of expansion while profitability improves.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest Internet retailer on Thursday reported its highest gross profit margins in a decade as years of spending on high-margin businesses, from digital media to cloud services, began to pay off. But slower revenue growth and a disappointing outlook for this quarter exacerbated uncertainty about the its business beyond the United States.\n\nAmazon faces a sluggish European economy and has had inconsistent success breaking into emerging markets such as China, where competition from the likes of Alibaba is intense.\n\nYear-over-year unit growth, which measures the number of items Amazon sells, was 30 percent in the first quarter, down from 49 percent in the first quarter of 2012.\n\nAs growth concerns worsen, the company will have trouble justifying its triple-digit price-earnings multiple. Analysts at J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse and Pacific Crest Securities on Friday lowered their price targets on Amazon shares, citing the top-line deceleration.\n\n\u201cAs unit growth decelerates, does Amazon stop being a growth stock and start becoming growth-at-a-reasonable price?\u201d said one analyst, who requested anonymity. \u201cMargins are coming up but they are still pretty low, so there\u2019s not much support for an earnings multiple valuation.\u201d\n\nThe analyst did not want to be identified because these concerns are based on a worst-case scenario for Amazon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my base case but that\u2019s the concern,\u201d the analyst added. \u201cThe stock could be stuck between $250 and $280.\u201d\n\nLonger-term, investors are keeping a close eye on a fundamental shift in its business.\n\nThe Internet retail giant that once specialized in moving books and other physical items quickly is increasingly trying to do the same in the digital world, where profit margins are higher, partly because e-books, music and video files and are transmitted electronically at high speed.\n\nIt has diversified aggressively into other revenue streams like digital content, advertising and the Amazon Web Services cloud computing business.

AWS is becoming a big part of their mix. They are also benefiting from a greater mix of advertising revenues. We\u2019ll continue to see that improve,\u201d said Victor Anthony, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets.\n\nBut its brick-and-mortar rivals are catching on, in many cases borrowing pages from Amazon\u2019s pioneering e-commerce play-book.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s now growing at about 2x eCommerce, compared to 3x a year ago,\u201d Doug Anmuth, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a note to investors following the company\u2019s results.\n\nRetailers are losing less market share to Amazon than they used to as they increase selection online, price-match more aggressively, and work to combat showrooming, Anmuth argued.\n\nShares of Best Buy Co and HH Gregg Inc, electronic retailers that have been particularly hard hit by Amazon competition, have doubled so far this year.\n\nAmazon shares are up 1.5 percent this year, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp are up about 16 percent and 20 percent, respectively.\n\nDespite declines, Amazon shares still trade at about 100 times 2013 estimated earnings and 75 times 2014 forecast profit.\n\nEven on a more-forgiving valuation method, Amazon shares are expensive. The stock trades at about 20 times earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. Google Inc trades at about 10 times EBITDA and eBay Inc trades at 11 to 12 times EBITDA.\n\nAmazon will need to pump out higher earnings in the future to support such valuations, especially if growth rates continue to slide, analysts said.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross profit margin hit a better-than-expected 26.6 percent in the first quarter, up from 24 percent a year earlier.\n\nStill, one major source of recent profit growth, Amazon\u2019s online marketplace for third-party sellers, known as 3P, stalled in early 2013.\n\nFirst-quarter 3P unit growth was 33 percent, down from a 40 percent growth rate in the first quarter of 2012, according to Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore Partners.\n\nAmazon\u2019s retail business, known as 1P, buys products at bulk prices and sells them at higher prices, collecting the difference as profit and recording the sale price as revenue.\n\nIn a 3P transaction, Amazon books commissions from third-party sales on its marketplace as revenue. That revenue is almost all profit, so as the 3P business has grown, Amazon\u2019s gross profit margins have expanded.\n\nThe slowdown in 3P growth during the first quarter \u201chas some concerned that the gross margin leverage story may be nearing its end,\u201d Sena said.\n\nAmazon shares were down 6.3 percent at $257.36 on Friday afternoon on the Nasdaq, off an earlier low at $252.81."
