        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is receiving offers of billions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies from cities and states across North America that are participating in a company contest to pick a location for its second headquarters.\n\nElected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with \u201cHQ2.\u201d For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.\n\nAmazon has said it will announce a decision next year.\n\n\u201cThere is no better place to do business than Canada,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.\n\nNew Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor\u2019s office earlier this week.\n\nA report from the California governor\u2019s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state\u2019s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\nAnd in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon\u2019s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.\n\n\u201cThe cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,\u201d said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.\n\nSince its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.\n\nIn some cases, the contest has gotten heated.\n\nNew Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: \u201cWhen you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you\u2019ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city\u2019s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.\n\n\u201cWe consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,\u201d said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.\n\nMany governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.\n\nThe bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri\u2019s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.\n\nOther candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.\n\n\u201dHey Amazon, we need to talk,\u201c ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. \u201dWe\u2019re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find what you\u2019re looking for. But it\u2019s just not us,\u201d the ad read."

(youtu.be/DO4J_PC1b5M)\n\n-- The Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation said a single bid was submitted for Colorado with eight urban and suburban sites.\n\n\u201cColorado does not have any up front discretionary incentives, nor do we believe that makes fiscally responsible policy. We have not gone back to the legislature to ask for any special closing fund of any type,\u201d said Sam Bailey, vice president of economic development at Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation.\n\n-- New Hampshire began its official bid by saying it has \u201call the benefits of Boston without all the headaches.\u201d\n\n-- Pennsylvania touted the state's location as being \"one day's drive from 40 percent of the U.S. population and 60 percent of Canada's population.\" (here)"
