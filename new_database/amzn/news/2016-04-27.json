When there was nothing left, they moved on to the next.\n\nThe five-day operation last week, led by Brazil\u2019s environmental agency Ibama and Indian foundation Funai, located 15 air strips and destroyed 20 barges used to transport equipment and supplies by the estimated 5,000 illegal miners in the vast remote region.\n\nImages of the raid can be seen in a Reuters Wider Image photo essay here\n\nAt more than 23.5 million acres (9.5 million hectares), the Yanomami people\u2019s territory is twice the size of Switzerland and home to around 27,000 indigenous people.\n\nThe land has legally belonged to the Yanomami since 1992, but miners continue to exploit the area, sawing down trees and poisoning rivers with mercury in their lust for gold.\n\nThe mercury has become a growing cause for concern. While miners once killed the Yanomami with guns or disease - nearly 20 percent of the population was wiped out in the 1980s - today the threat is the toxic liquid metal used to separate gold from grit.\n\nA study published last month by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a public biomedical research group, found that in some Yanomami villages, 92 percent of residents suffered from mercury poisoning. The results shocked experts, who believe mercury is entering the food chain through fish in polluted rivers.\n\nHigh mercury exposure harms the nervous, digestive and immune systems, can lead to impaired vision and hearing, and can be fatal.\n\nLast week\u2019s raid was considered a success but Ibama\u2019s operation leader Roberto Cabral said the miners will probably be back.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to destroy their equipment. We\u2019re not able to arrest them, there\u2019s no space in the helicopter,\u201d he said, sweat pouring down his face in the middle of the steamy jungle.\n\nWhen miners were caught, they were grilled for information and released. Beyond the equipment, authorities have been hunting for clues on the illicit business interests behind the miners.\n\nFrom a base in the Tepequ\u00e9m mountains on the frontier with Venezuela, three helicopters flew the 35-person team for an hour and a half to the banks of the majestic Uraricoera river.\n\nFrom there it was another hour or two on foot, cutting aside branches and wading through waist-high mud, to reach the mines. It is expensive and rare for the arm of the law to reach this far.\n\nIt might become rarer still. With Brazil suffering through its worst recession in a century, Funai\u2019s budget for 2016 was cut by 24 percent, while Ibama had its spending reduced by 30 percent.\n\nFor Fiona Watson, who works for the activist group Survival International and has campaigned for the Yanomami since 1990, any long-term solution must be based on having more people on the ground, graver punishments and a focus on those hiring the miners and supplying equipment.\n\n\u201cThese miners are like ants,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThey just keep coming back.\u201d"
