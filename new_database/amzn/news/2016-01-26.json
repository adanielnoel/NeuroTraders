        "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A German court has declared unlawful a feature that encourages Amazon customers to share links to products of the online shop with their contacts, confirming the ruling of a lower court.\n\nThe Amazon \u201cshare\u201d feature invites customers to share a product via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter or Pintrest.\n\nThe court said on Monday that sharing by e-mail without approval of the recipient was illegal. It is \u201cunsolicited advertising and unreasonable harassment,\u201d the regional court in Hamm said, confirming the ruling of a lower court in Arnsberg.\n\nThe case was brought against one of Amazon\u2019s resellers by a competitor.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ruling comes after Germany\u2019s highest court ruled earlier this month that a similar feature that encourages Facebook users to market the social media network to their contacts as unlawful.\n\nAt the time, the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (VZBV), which brought the Facebook case to court, had said the ruling would have implications for other services in Germany which use similar forms of advertising."
