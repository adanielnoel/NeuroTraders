        "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Tuesday it has partnered with Instacart Inc to deliver groceries for as little as $3.99 per order, as it overhauls its food business and competes with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s grocery delivery service.\n\nThe discount retailer will launch a pilot to test the offering in its hometown of Minneapolis and customers in some areas will be able to order online for food, pet products and baby items from two Target stores and have them delivered to their homes.\n\nTarget has been revamping its grocery department after customer complaints about freshness and product quality, and the business has been a key priority for Chief Executive Brian Cornell. The company\u2019s grocery division accounted for more than 20 percent of revenue last year, with approximately $18 billion in sales.\n\nThe push expands online order options for Target customers, who can get free delivery within five days on a $25 minimum order.\n\nAt $3.99 per order, Target customers would have to place 75 orders to match the cost of Amazon\u2019s annual $299 delivery fee for groceries.\n\nOnline groceries are a $10.9 billion industry in the United States, and the market is expected to grow 9.6 percent annually through 2019, according to a December report by market research firm IbisWorld. One of the largest players in the segment is Amazon Fresh, which delivers in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia, and northern and southern California.\n\nTarget\u2019s grocery delivery pilot follows on a recent expansion of its curbside pick-up test, which started in San Francisco.\n\nWith the partnership, Target joins an increasingly long list of companies using Instacart for last mile delivery, including Whole Foods Market Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and most recently the H-E-B grocery chain in Texas.\n\nInstacart does not hold inventory but picks up orders from the store and brings them to a customer\u2019s home in as little as one hour. The company said it was exploring plans to expand Target deliveries beyond Minneapolis."

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - When Tina Fey pitched a comedy series to broadcast network NBC, the home of her Emmy-winning hit \u201c30 Rock,\u201d she ran into problems with the new show\u2019s \u201cpotentially tricky\u201d premise about a woman held hostage by a religious zealot.\n\n\u201cWith broadcast, when you\u2019re going into people\u2019s homes, you have to be a little more polite,\u201d Fey told Reuters. On the streaming service Netflix, however, \u201cyou can get into more dangerous topics.\u201d\n\nIn two years, Netflix Inc and online streaming platform Amazon Studios have drawn top names across film and television, enticing them with creative liberty, freedom from time constraints and no fears of offending advertisers.\n\nAs a result, online platforms are fast defining a new age of television that is reflected in 46 nominations for Amazon and Netflix shows at Sunday\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nFey\u2019s controversial topic came in the form of \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d about a chirpy, naive \u2018mole woman\u2019 who moves to New York after escaping her cult-like captor.\n\n\u201cWith a premise like this that is potentially tricky for people - a kidnapped woman who\u2019s getting her life back - once you move to Netflix, the premise is not a problem at all,\u201d Fey said.\n\nThe show goes into Sunday\u2019s ceremony with seven Emmy nominations including best comedy series. Netflix\u2019s political thriller \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and prison drama \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d are also well represented, along with Amazon\u2019s groundbreaking transgender series \u201cTransparent.\u201d\n\nAmazon offers TV shows and movies through its $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership. It releases a selection of pilots online and uses audience input to help decide which to greenlight.\n\nOn-demand viewing offered on streaming platforms lets viewers watch at their own pace and all episodes are released at once. The model disposes with scheduling decisions, breaks for commercials or potential problems with advertisers over content.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no topic we can\u2019t go toward. You don\u2019t have to worry about advertisers or institutions,\u201d Fey said.\n\nFor the creators of upcoming series \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d based on Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel of an alternate America in which the Nazis won World War Two, Amazon was the last port of call after a nearly decade-long journey to bring the series to television.\n\n\u201cThis show would not exist now were it not for Amazon,\u201d said Isa Dick Hackett, the late author\u2019s daughter and executive producer of the series, who pitched the show previously to the BBC and Syfy networks. It will be released on Amazon in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly ambitious, the material is sensitive. People said \u2018we don\u2019t want to do a show with Nazis,'\u201d Hackett said.\n\nBrazilian filmmaker Jose Padilha said Netflix was his only choice for his gritty Spanish/English-language drug drama \u201cNarcos,\u201d mainly for its reach across more than 50 countries, including Spanish-speaking nations.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make it bilingual because the real life story was bilingual, and we thought Netflix had the audience that would go for that,\u201d he said of \u201cNarcos,\u201d which was released on Netflix in August.\n\nSome of Hollywood\u2019s biggest players who have largely avoided television are now embracing the streaming trend.\n\nWoody Allen, who has not worked in television in more than 50 years, is creating a series for Amazon for release next year while Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are developing separate movies for Netflix."

        "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway will make a final $100-million payment to Brazil this year to complete a $1-billion project that rewards a slowdown in forest loss in the Amazon basin, Norway\u2019s Environment Ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nBrazil had more than achieved a goal of reducing the rate of deforestation by 75 percent, the condition for the payments under an agreement for 2008-15 meant to protect the forest and slow climate change, it said.\n\nThe remaining cash would be paid before a U.N. summit on climate change in Paris in December, the ministry said. Since 2008, Norway has paid about $900 million to Brazil\u2019s Amazon Fund.\n\n\u201cBrazil has established what has become a model for other national climate change funds,\u201d Norwegian Environment Minister Tine Sundtoft said in a statement.\n\nNorway, rich from offshore oil, has been the biggest donor to protect tropical rainforests, which soak up heat-trapping carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when trees rot or are burnt to make way for farmland.\n\nOslo is also financing projects to help protect forests in countries including Indonesia, Guyana, Liberia and Peru.\n\nWorldwide, the rate at which trees were cut down slowed for the third year in a row in 2014, but the area lost was still twice the size of Portugal, the U.S.-based think-tank World Resources Institute said on Sept. 2.\n\n\u201cThis is an outstanding example of the kind of international collaboration we need to ensure the future sustainability of our planet,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement on the Brazilian deal.\n\nBrazil says the cash has helped its national efforts to slow deforestation. Brazilian President Dilma Roussef says she wants to reach a zero deforestation rate.\n\nA Norwegian ministry spokeswoman, Gunhild Oland Santos-Nedrelid, said Norway and Brazil were in talks about further collaboration. She did not give details."

        "body": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos unveiled plans on Tuesday to build a rocket manufacturing plant and launch site in Florida to better compete with fellow billionaires using their fortunes and tech prowess to open a new frontier in human space travel and exploration.\n\nBezos\u2019 space startup, Blue Origin, intends to invest more than $200 million to build the rocket-making facility adjacent to NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe vehicles will blast off from a refurbished launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of NASA\u2019s seaside spaceport.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, I was inspired by the giant Saturn 5 (Apollo moon) missions that roared to life from these shores. Today, we\u2019re thrilled to be coming to the Sunshine State for a new era of exploration,\u201d Bezos told an invitation-only crowd gathered at the company\u2019s launch site.\n\nBezos\u2019 announcement comes at a pivotal time in the U.S. space industry, which is luring private investment and technological innovation in an attempt to lower the cost of space travel and improve safety.\n\nBlue Origin is competing against Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and a handful of other startups backed by billionaire entrepreneurs, including Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Virgin Group Chief Executive Richard Branson.\n\nLike Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic, one of Blue Origin\u2019s goals is to fly tourists into suborbital, and ultimately orbital, space.\n\n\u201cFor sure, this is an industry where people are competitive, but I think it\u2019s also an industry where there is a lot of heart and people doing this for reasons of passion,\u201d Bezos said.\n\n\u201cIf my only goal were to make money, I\u2019d would just open a new kind of snack food company. It\u2019s way more likely to work ... but I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he added.\n\nBlue Origin has been developing and testing a small rocket in West Texas, called New Shepard, that can travel about 62 (100 km) above the planet before returning to Earth. The company\u2019s new rockets, which have yet to be named, will be able to reach orbital altitudes, such as the 250- (400 km) mile-high perch of the International Space Station, and beyond.\n\nBlue Origin also will test its new BE-4 engines in Florida. The company is partnering with United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint-venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, on the engine development. Bezos later told reporters he is not sure whether the engine would fly first on ULA\u2019s Vulcan rocket, or Blue\u2019s booster.\n\n\u201cOur approach on this is very simple, which is heads down, focus on the technology,\u201d Bezos said.\n\nULA also is backing an alternative engine under development by Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc, which last month submitted a $2 cash billion offer to buy ULA.\n\n\u201cUltimately (ULA) will make the decision about what they want to do, but we\u2019re going to work our butts off to give them a great engine,\u201d Bezos told Reuters.\n\nBezos said Blue Origin\u2019s new rocket should debut before the end of the decade. He declined to say how much he had invested in Blue Origin to date but said it was \u201csignificant with much more to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2018m a huge believer that this is a viable and good business,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cI\u2018m also kind of well known for being long-term oriented, although I think Blue Origin is going to set a new standard for me in that regard.\u201d"
