        "body": "TORONTO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Locals are more effective than governments in protecting the world\u2019s largest rainforest, a study said on Tuesday, amid efforts to crackdown on soaring illegal deforestation.\n\nRanching and logging are rapidly destroying forests that have been home for centuries to indigenous communities in the Amazon, often dubbed the \u201clungs of the planet\u201d for its role in sucking up climate-changing carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cOur analysis shows that local stewardship of the forest can be very effective in curtailing forest degradation in the Peruvian Amazon,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Judith Schleicher, a researcher at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cLocal conservation initiatives deserve more political, financial and legal support than they currently receive.\u201d\n\nThe study by British and Peruvian researchers used remote sensing information and official data from 2006 to 2011 to compare government-run protected areas in Peru with lands managed by local forest communities and indigenous groups.\n\nWhile both strategies proved more effective for maintaining rainforest than non-protected areas, those managed by locals fared better than government-administered land, it found.\n\nCampaigners hope the involvement of Peru\u2019s environment ministry in the study could shift management policies.\n\nPeru has pledged to reach zero net new deforestation by 2021, but environmentalists say a push by illegal gold miners and palm oil producers into the Amazon frontier could make that goal impossible.\n\n\u201cThe population is a great strategic ally to conserve our ecosystems,\u201d she said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nCampaigners say environment ministry officials face pressure from powerful lobby groups with economic interests in extracting raw materials from the Amazon who oppose handing control over forest lands to local communities.\n\nMore than 40 percent of Peru\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions come from land-use change and forestry, according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\nInvasions of indigenous lands close to Brazil\u2019s border with Peru have been increasing with at least 10 members of an \u201cuncontacted\u201d tribe reportedly massacred last month by gold miners."

        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Endangered indigenous tribes are increasingly facing threats from miners in the Amazon rainforest amid budget cuts to the Brazilian government agency responsible for protecting them, local officials and activists say.\n\nA federal prosecutor in Brazil\u2019s Amazonas state has launched an investigation into a reported massacre of at least 10 members of an \u201cuncontacted\u201d tribe by gold miners in a remote area along the Jandiatuba river, close to Peru\u2019s border.\n\nA unit of the indigenous affairs agency, Funai, was recently closed, leaving indigenous lands exposed to invaders, activists say.\n\n\u201cThere is an ongoing inquiry into the case but I cannot speak about its content in order to not prejudice the investigation,\u201d federal prosecutor Pablo Beltrand told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nIf confirmed, the massacre would be one of the worst such tragedies since the murder of 16 Yanomami indigenous people in 1993.\n\nFunai officials in Amazonas received an audio clip with miners bragging about the crime, said Gustavo Souza, acting coordinator of Funai\u2019s ethno-environmental protection front at Vale do Javari, where the murders allegedly took place.\n\nSouza said he heard miners in the recording saying there were women and children on the river bank and they shot them.\n\n\u201cIn the audio, one of the miners said \u2018you know, I do not mistake a shot\u2019,\u201d Souza told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He also saw a picture of a hand-crafted paddle that reportedly belonged to the indigenous tribe.\n\nThe number of invasions in indigenous lands in Vale do Javari has been increasing amid budget cuts - part of austerity measures aimed at lifting Brazil out of its worst recession in decades.\n\n\u201cWith budget cuts this year, there was a reduction of Funai\u2019s team in the area by half,\u201d Souza said.\n\nAlthough Vale do Javari is one of the largest indigenous reserves in the country, it is patrolled by just 10 Funai officials.\n\nThe officials attempt to monitor an area of 85,000 sq km, home to largest number of uncontacted indigenous worldwide.\n\n\u201cIndigenous lands are at risk amid increasing invasions and we\u2019re afraid that it\u2019ll get worse from now on,\u201d Souza said.\n\nCarla de Lello Lorenzi, spokeswoman at indigenous rights group Survival International, said the cuts put indigenous lives at risk.\n\n\u201cThese tribes are completely vulnerable. If miners and loggers get into their land, they are very vulnerable to violence and diseases,\u201d Lorenzi said."
