        "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) MILAN/LONDON, October 25 (Fitch) Last Sunday's referendums in Veneto and Lombardy are unlikely to lead to near-term changes in the financial relationship between the two regions and the central government, Fitch Ratings says. But they highlight a debate about the devolution of responsibilities, the allocation of associated financial resources, and ultimately the degree of Italian regions' fiscal autonomy. Both referendums saw strong support, among those who voted, for proposals to increase regional control of revenue and spending across areas such as healthcare, education and infrastructure. Turnout in Veneto was over 59%, compared with just under 40% in Lombardy. Regional leaders have said they will present devolution plans to the central government in the coming weeks. The region of Emilia Romagna is also trying to start negotiations following a vote by its regional assembly, while the region of Puglia is considering such an initiative. Whether and when talks start will also depend on political developments. We do not think detailed discussion of regional reform that could cut across numerous policy areas is a priority ahead of national elections due by May 2018 and elections in some regions, including Lombardy. Opinion polls suggest a fragmented parliament and difficult coalition dynamics. The Northern League, which governs in Veneto and Lombardy with Forza Italia and called the referendums, appears likely to be part of a centre-right coalition that will contest the elections. If it formed part of the next government, it could move regional reform up the political agenda, but we think any discussions would be lengthy. Sunday's referendums highlight a broader desire among Italian regional governments to resume devolution. This was planned before the eurozone crisis brought the process to a halt and prompted the central government to impose more stringent conditions on regional finances as part of its efforts to meet national government debt and deficit reduction targets. Restrictions include conditions on spending and the redistribution of tax revenue - for example, funds that are explicitly allocated by the central government for healthcare cannot be used to meet other responsibilities. We think any central government response to new proposals will be conditioned at least in part by the desire to contain very high public debt. We therefore think it is unlikely that any of Italy's 15 'ordinary status' regions will achieve a level of fiscal autonomy on a par with the five 'special status' regions (Valle d'Aosta, Friuli, Provinces of Trento and Bolzano, Sardinia, Sicily) in the medium term. These five regions' shares of national tax revenues are protected under the constitution, limiting the central government's ability to adjust them unilaterally, which is one of the reasons they can be rated above Italy's sovereign IDR. Conversely, ratings of 'ordinary status' regions are capped by the sovereign rating, which we affirmed at 'BBB'/Stable on 20 October. Although constitutional provisions link regional revenues to economic performance, the central government currently pools business taxes, a large part of the regions' share of personal income tax, and about 50% of VAT, to fund healthcare, which accounts for about three-quarters of spending on average for 'ordinary status' regions. If the financial relationship between the central government and 'ordinary status' regions eventually evolved towards more autonomy similar to that of the 'special status' regions, the sovereign rating cap could be lifted.

The manner of Fitch\u2019s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has plans to drop off packages directly into shoppers\u2019 homes.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest online retailer on Wednesday announced Amazon Key, a lock and camera system that users control remotely to let delivery associates slip goods into their houses. Customers can create temporary passcodes for friends and other services professionals to enter as well.\n\nThe move, in the works for more than a year, may help Amazon capture sales from shoppers who could not make it home to receive an order in person, and did not want the package stolen from their doorstep. It also signals Amazon\u2019s ambitions in the growing market for home security devices, where Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Nest Labs competes.\n\n\u201cThis is not an experiment for us,\u201d said Peter Larsen, Amazon vice president of delivery technology. \u201cThis is a core part of the Amazon shopping experience from this point forward.\u201d\n\nMembers of Amazon\u2019s Prime shopping club can pay $249.99 and up for a cloud-controlled camera and lock the company offers to install. Delivery associates are told to ring a doorbell or knock when they arrive at someone\u2019s house. If no one greets them, they press \u2018unlock\u2019 in a mobile app, and Amazon checks its systems in an instant to make sure the right associate and package are present.\n\nThe camera then streams video to the customer, who can view the delivery remotely. The associate cannot proceed with other trips until the home is again locked.\n\nLarsen said in-home theft was \u201cnot something that happens in practice,\u201d based on trials of Amazon Key. In some cases Amazon will reimburse customers if a problem arises, he said.\n\nIt is unclear if such protections will satisfy customers\u2019 security concerns.\n\nDemand for other smart lock systems has so far been small compared to connected devices like the Amazon Echo speaker, according to a survey by TECHnalysis Research.\n\n\u201cConsumers are unwilling to relinquish control of the door lock to a faceless, unknown delivery person,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s just creepy.\u201d\n\nHe said the move may portend a broader home security service from Amazon, appealing to high-income Prime members.\n\nAmazon Key is not yet integrated with home alarm systems.\n\nRival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) last month announced similar delivery plans, saying it would test placing grocery items \u201cstraight into your fridge\u201d, in partnership with smart lock business August Home.\n\nAmazon Key launches on Nov. 8 in 37 U.S. locations, Amazon said."
