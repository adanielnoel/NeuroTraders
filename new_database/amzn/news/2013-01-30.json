        "body": "* S&P 500 on track for best month since October 2011\n\n* Fed to conclude meeting, no change in policy seen\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat on Wednesday as investors digested recent gains and awaited key U.S. economic data, though Amazon and Boeing both rose after earnings topped expectations.\n\nEquities have soared in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 rising for nine of the past 10 sessions. The Dow Jones industrial average has been flirting with 14,000, a level it hasn\u2019t seen since October 2007. Many analysts have said markets may need to take a pause at current levels.\n\nThe first read on U.S. fourth-quarter economic growth is due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) Analysts see a 1.1 percent annualized pace of growth in GDP, down from the 3.1 percent in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into the slowing from the third quarter, since that was impacted by (superstorm) Sandy and the fiscal cliff. The momentum in the data has been strong, which could be enough to keep us grinding higher,\u201d said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O\u2018Brien & Associates in Chicago.\n\nTraders will also look to the January ADP employment report, which is expected to show 165,000 private-sector jobs were created in the month, down from 215,000 in December. The report precedes the closely watched nonfarm payroll report on Friday, which is expected to show modest but steady job growth.\n\nAmazon.com Inc was the latest high-profile name to rally after results, rising 8.8 percent to $283.30 in premarket trading a day after the online retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and strong revenue growth. The rally put the stock within striking distance of an all-time high.\n\nBoeing Co rose 1 percent to $74.35 before the bell after reporting adjusted fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations. The Dow component also said that while production continued on its Dreamliner segment, which has had technical problems recently, it was suspending delivery until clearance was granted by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThomson Reuters data showed that of the 174 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings this season, 68.4 percent have been above analyst expectations, which is a higher proportion than over the past four quarters and above the average since 1994.\n\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.7 point but remained above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 2 points.\n\nThe S&P has been hovering around 1,500, a level market technicians say is an inflection point that will determine the overall direction in the near term. The benchmark index is on track to post its best monthly performance since October 2011 as investors poured $55 billion in new cash into stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in January, the biggest monthly inflow on record.\n\nThe Federal Reserve concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday, and while the central bank is expected to keep monetary policy on a steady path, intensive debates continue behind the scenes over when the controversial bond-buying program should be curtailed.\n\nIn company news, Chesapeake Energy Corp rose 10.5 percent to $20.95 in premarket trading a day after saying Aubrey McClendon would step down as chief executive after a year in which a series of Reuters investigations triggered civil and criminal probes of the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer.\n\nU.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, led by defensive sectors, in a sign the cash piles recently moving into the market are being put to use by cautious investors to pick up more gains."

However, private sector employment topped forecasts, with the ADP National Employment report showing 192,000 jobs added in January, higher than the 165,000 expectation.\n\n\u201cThe GDP report is the only negative shock we\u2019ve had in a while, and it isn\u2019t terrible since it showed increases in business and consumer spending, which is what everyone wants to drive growth from here,\u201d said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\nDeeper losses were prevented by a rise in both Boeing Co and Amazon.com Inc, which rallied after earnings beat expectations, continuing a trend this quarter of high-profile names advancing after results.\n\nAmazon.com Inc rose 6.7 percent to $277.87 a day after reporting strong revenue growth. Boeing rose 0.5 percent to $74 after its results. The Dow component also said that while production continued on its Dreamliner jet, which has had technical problems recently, it was suspending delivery until clearance was granted by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThomson Reuters data showed that of the 174 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings this season, 68.4 percent have been above analyst expectations, which is a higher proportion than over the past four quarters and above the average since 1994.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 5.50 points, or 0.04 percent, at 13,959.92. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was up 1.09 points, or 0.07 percent, at 1,508.93.

Many analysts have said markets may need to take a pause.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m neutral on markets at these levels, even though there aren\u2019t a lot of negatives out there,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cAt some point there will be a pullback, but the underlying trends remain strong and I think it is possible the S&P could hit a new all-time high sometime this quarter.\u201d\n\nThe all-time intraday high for the S&P 500 is 1,576.09, reached Oct. 11, 2007.\n\nThe Federal Reserve concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday, and while the central bank is expected to keep monetary policy on a steady path, intensive debates continue behind the scenes over when the controversial bond-buying program should be curtailed.\n\nChesapeake Energy Corp rose 11 percent to $21.11 as the S&P\u2019s biggest percentage gainer, a day after saying Aubrey McClendon would step down as chief executive after a year in which a series of Reuters investigations triggered civil and criminal probes of the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer."

Hottovy, a Morningstar analyst. \u201cIt levels the playing field for brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d\n\nCritics of Amazon have long railed against what they deem an unfair advantage, because for years most other retailers have had to collect state sales tax on online sales because they operate physical stores in those states.\n\nBut many states, hungry for extra revenue to plug yawning deficits following the financial crisis, introduced laws requiring that Internet-only retailers also collect sales tax. Brick-and-mortar retailers hope the requirement will trim Amazon\u2019s price advantage and eventually help them recoup lost sales.\n\nAmazon\u2019s fourth-quarter results - due on January 29 - should provide clues as to whether U.S. consumers changed their shopping habits when faced with higher taxes on their purchases.\n\n\u201cThis makes Amazon equal to everyone else. They no longer have that sales tax advantage,\u201d said Anne Zybowski, vice president of retail insights at Kantar Retail. \u201cIf this had happened to Amazon when they were just a bookseller years ago, they may not be as big as they are now.\u201d\n\nWall Street on the whole is betting that e-commerce companies like Amazon and eBay Inc (EBAY.O) fared better than retail rivals rooted in the physical world.

Amazon does not break out sales in individual states or markets.\n\nAmazon began collecting sales tax of 7.25 percent to 9.75 percent in California about two weeks before the start of the fourth quarter. It started collecting sales tax in Pennsylvania in September, and in Texas in July.\n\nChannelAdvisor, which helps merchants boost sales online, analyzed clients\u2019 sales growth on Amazon in California and in the rest of the country before and after the Golden State\u2019s internet sales tax kicked in.\n\nFrom July through early September, sales growth in California for Amazon clients was 5 percent to 10 percent higher than in the rest of the United States. But the week before the September 15 start of the tax, sales growth spiked as much as 70 percent above growth in the rest of the country as buyers rushed to beat the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe surge before the tax went into effect was much larger than I thought it would be,\u201d said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor.\n\nAfter September 15, California sales growth rose at the same pace as the rest of the country. But in early November, sales growth slipped as much as 10 percent below the rest of the nation, ChannelAdvisor data showed.\n\nDuring one of the busiest holiday periods, from late November to early December, sales growth dipped further in California. Only toward the end of the holiday period did client sales growth in California recover, the data showed.\n\nEBay, another Amazon rival, is an investor in ChannelAdvisor. Wingo also owned Amazon shares but sold them in the fourth quarter for personal tax reasons, he said.\n\nThe California tax impact was particularly pronounced on items priced at $200 to $250, Wingo said.\n\nBest Buy\u2019s solid showing during the holidays may provide another clue to the tax\u2019s impact.\n\nOverall, Best Buy reported better-than-expected holiday sales last week.\n\nDespite the tax changes, Amazon\u2019s consumer electronics prices were still at least 5 percent below Best Buy\u2019s during the holiday season, Kantar\u2019s Zybowski said. But Best Buy may have benefited from even a small change in this area.\n\n\u201cParticularly in consumer electronics, any narrowing of Amazon\u2019s price advantage at the margin is important because Best Buy brings service and other shopper benefits to the category,\u201d she said.\n\nAn Amazon spokesman declined to comment when asked if the company saw an impact on fourth-quarter sales from the collection of sales tax in the three states.\n\nIn the past, Amazon executives have said there was little or no impact from such changes in other regions.\n\nSeveral analysts said that shoppers use Amazon not just because they can find a bargain, but also because of its vast selection, convenience, fast shipping and returns.

Petroecuador is the downstream company, and runs three refineries and a key oil pipeline.\n\n\u201cThe (output) increase will come mainly from work that Petroamazonas will carry out in the fields that we just received from Petroecuador,\u201d Madrid said.\n\nHe said that Ecuador\u2019s average crude output is likely to increase to 524,000 bpd in 2013 and to 540,000 bpd in 2014.\n\nEcuador is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Copuntries\u2019 smallest member, and in 2011 its average production reached 500,000 bpd, up from 486,000 bpd in 2010.\n\nAfter taking office in 2007, Ecuador\u2019s leftist president, Rafael Correa, introduced reforms to increase state revenue from the oil industry, and since then foreign oil companies have not invested in new projects.\n\nIn November, Ecuador launched a licensing round for 13 oil blocks in Amazon areas near the border with Peru, while Petroamazonas plans to tap three more blocks nearby.\n\nHigher crude prices have allowed Correa to increase social spending in recent years, which in turn has boosted his popularity among the country\u2019s poor majority ahead of a presidential election scheduled for February.
