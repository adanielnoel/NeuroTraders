        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) accelerated its efforts to win over corporate clients on Wednesday by announcing an email and scheduling service that will compete with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O).\n\nThe service, dubbed WorkMail, will launch in the second quarter and has been developed by the company\u2019s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It highlights Amazon\u2019s efforts to convince deep-pocketed companies, called enterprises in tech parlance, to shift more of their work to AWS.\n\nLaunching an email and scheduling service is likely the first step toward a broader suite of Amazon tools to gain corporate clients, analysts said. For example, Google\u2019s Gmail offers many other services beyond email and calendars including file-sharing and video conferencing.\n\nAWS has spent the last couple of years trying to get corporate clients on board because big businesses spend more on data centers than startups, who were the initial focus of its business. But there are concerns that Amazon is spreading itself too thin, given its other sizeable investments in areas like Hollywood-style production and consumer devices.\n\n\u201cEmail is a Trojan Horse into the enterprise,\u201d Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said. He added that email is a $1 billion opportunity for Amazon given the popularity of AWS and Amazon\u2019s willingness to sacrifice margins for volume.\n\nIf Amazon adds more services for companies, it could bring in about $10 billion more in extra revenue, Sebastian said."
