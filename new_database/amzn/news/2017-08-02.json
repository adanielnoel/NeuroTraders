        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has made it first move into major sports rights outside the United States by outbidding Sky for the exclusive UK rights to tennis\u2019s ATP World Tour, the Guardian said on Tuesday.\n\nAmazon Prime Video agreed to pay as much as 10 million pounds ($13.2 million) a year for the rights, which include the ATP Tour finals competition between the top eight singles and doubles players, the newspaper said.\n\nSky was paying about 8 million pounds a year under a deal that lasts until 2018, the Guardian said.\n\nAmazon won the streaming rights in the United States for NFL\u2019s Thursday Night Football in April, kicking off a push by the online retailer to attract fans to its shopping and video service.\n\nSky, Britain\u2019s biggest pay-TV group, said last week it had walked away from bidding on some sports rights as it invest elsewhere in the business, including continuing to broaden its drama and entertainment content.\n\nSky has recently reorganized its sports broadcasting to create channels dedicated to specific sports such as soccer, cricket, Formula One and golf."
