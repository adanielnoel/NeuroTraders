McDaniels\u2019 lawyer did not immediately respond to similar requests.\n\nRun-DMC was founded in the New York City borough of Queens in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph \u201cRun\u201d Simmons and Jason \u201cJam Master Jay\u201d Mizell. It became one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s, including for the album \u201cRaising Hell\u201d and such songs as the Aerosmith cover \u201cWalk This Way\u201d and \u201cMy Adidas.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe case is Run-DMC Brand LLC v Amazon.com Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-10011."
