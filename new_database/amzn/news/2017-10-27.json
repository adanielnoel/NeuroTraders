        "body": "YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - By day, the Daikoku Parking Area hums with transport trucks en route to and from the Port of Yokohama. On weekend evenings, it transforms into a revved-up runway of tuned-up Japanese cars.\n\nThe unassuming rest stop is famous to car enthusiasts as a temple of the country\u2019s motor culture, but it also illustrates a \u201cyouth\u201d problem that auto companies such as Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co are scrambling to address.\n\nThe crowd last Friday - around 50 supercar fans who huddled around the back of a loading truck to get a first glimpse of the latest Lamborghini Huracan Performante delivered days before to collector Takeshi Kimura - were mainly men in their 40s and 50s.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s young people, they came of age during the recession, and some of them didn\u2019t grow up with a family car,\u201d said Kimura, who has earned a reputation on Japanese social media as an ambassador of car culture thanks to stunts including coasting his Ferrari F40 down ski slopes and racing his supercars around a driving school practice course.\n\n\u201cAs a result, people hit their 20s and they\u2019re not aware of how fun cars can be.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the cars whose finely-tuned growls echoed beneath the overpasses that criss-cross the Daikoku lot are mostly from the 1990s heyday of Japan\u2019s auto industry.\n\nBack then, Honda Motor Co, Nissan and their compatriots forged a global reputation for their stylish, fast, highly engineered cars. Drifting, the technique of sliding rear-wheel-drive cars through bends that entered popular culture through films like the Fast and the Furious franchise, was born on Japan\u2019s winding roads.\n\nToday, even those young Japanese who do get the car bug are unimpressed by the domestic choices on offer.\n\n\u201cThese days automakers just aren\u2019t making cars I\u2019d want to drive,\u201d said Sho Watabe, a 20-year-old student who had rocked up to Daikoku in his 1996 Mazda RX-7.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the way cars are designed these days, they all look the same. They all lack personality ... If automakers keep making the same types of cars, young people are going to continue turning away from them.\u201d\n\nJapanese car makers for years have grappled with falling interest in cars among young people, which, along with a rapidly greying society, has led to a 17 percent fall in domestic vehicle sales since 2000, data from the Japan Auto Dealers Association shows.\n\nThe number of Japanese license holders aged under 30 has dropped 35 percent since 2001, according to National Police Agency data, even as the total number of license holders has increased around 9 percent during the same period.\n\nThe country\u2019s tuning culture, once known among global car fans for its focus on squeezing as much speed as possible out of mass-market models, is also losing its pep, as complex control units and sensors make cars increasingly hard to tinker with.\n\nTo appease car enthusiasts and drum up more interest among young people, Toyota last month launched a new line of customized, sporty versions of the Prius, Yaris and other existing models in Japan under its Gazoo racing brand, which feature sports car tuning and racing trims.\n\nNissan is also marketing more sportier siblings of its flagship models, unveiling racing versions of its Leaf electric car and its Serena minivan at the Tokyo Motor Show this week.\n\n\u201cMass market consumers want reliable, convenient cars, but we want to position Gazoo as a platform to use our \u2018secret sauce\u2019, to use our tuning capabilities to attract car fans,\u201d Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters last month.\n\nTo raise brand awareness among young car fans, Toyota and a growing number of automakers and suppliers are tapping the country\u2019s drifting culture, which has cleaned up its image after being associated for years with illegal road racing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t participate in motor sports in a big way, so we weren\u2019t registering with young drivers, a small but important market for us,\u201d said Junichi Sugano, a spokesman at Toyo Tires, known domestically as a specialist in minivan tires, which was a sponsor of the first-ever FIA Intercontinental Drift Cup held earlier this month in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cPeople who attend drift events, not all of them drift, a lot of them drive minivans.\u201d\n\nLonger term, Toyota has also promised to expand its sports car line-up, stoking anticipation of a revival of its popular Supra model.\n\nBack at Daikoku, Kimura, who set up Car Guy, a crew of car enthusiasts, has some advice for Japanese manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIf Japanese automakers want more young people to buy their cars, they have to come up with truly stylish and unique cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to come to places like this and show cars that will get kids\u2019 hearts racing.\u201d"

        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday said its sales surged over the summer and profit trounced expectations, as shoppers jumped at \u201cPrime Day\u201d promotions on its website and bought groceries at its newly acquired chain of Whole Foods Market stores.\n\nShares rose more than 7 percent in after-hours trade.\n\nAmazon is winning business from older, big box rivals by delivering virtually any product to customers at a low cost, and at times faster than it takes to buy goods from a physical store. It acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August to help it deliver groceries to shoppers\u2019 doorsteps.\n\nAmazon\u2019s results defied expectations that it would invest nearly all of its earnings into new areas as it has in the past. The world\u2019s largest online retailer said net income rose to $256 million, or 52 cents per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average were expecting 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\n\u201cThis company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.\n\nPrime Day, a summer marketing event Amazon has created to replicate the shopping frenzy that is more typical of the winter holiday season, helped boost sales.\n\nRevenue rose 34 percent to $43.7 billion in the third quarter, including $1.3 billion in sales from Whole Foods. Analysts had expected $42.1 billion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a lot of integration,\u201d Amazon\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts, citing how Amazon\u2019s two-hour delivery service Prime Now could work with Whole Foods, for instance.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ll also be developing new store formats,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a first, Amazon broke out sales for its online retail business and for its physical bookstores and Whole Foods locations. Revenue from its online stores jumped 22 percent to $26.4 billion, the fastest growth Amazon has seen in the segment in more than a year.\n\nKey to its success has been signing more people up for Amazon Prime, its fast-shipping and video-streaming club, whose members tend to buy more from the company. Revenue from subscription fees such as Prime grew 59 percent to $2.4 billion.\n\nAnd Amazon Web Services (AWS), which handles data and computing for large enterprises, saw its profit margin expand from the previous quarter. It posted a 41.9 percent rise in sales to $4.58 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.52 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.\n\n\u201cThey are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u201d Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said.\n\nAmazon shares have a high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio more than eight times that of cloud-computing rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for instance.\n\nUnlike peers, Amazon runs on razor-thin profit margins because it sinks most of its profit back into its business.\n\nThis quarter, which includes the shopping holiday Black Friday, Amazon said it expects operating profit between $300 million and $1.65 billion. Analysts were expecting $930.78 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nAmazon\u2019s profit is going toward a dizzying number of investments: warehouses for faster shipping, data centers for AWS, and a 77 percent uptick in employees last quarter, including Whole Foods workers.\n\nThe company plans to spend more on video content next year as well, Olsavsky said. Analysts estimate Amazon will have spent $4.5 billion this year.\n\nThe commitment to content comes after Amazon Studios chief Roy Price resigned last week, and other top studio hands left the company.\n\nIt is unclear what impact the shakeup may have on Amazon\u2019s ability to secure video that competes with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) for viewers\u2019 attention.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares, which closed down 0.05 percent on Thursday, rose about 7.5 percent to $1,046 in after-hours trading following the earnings statement. They had gained about 30 percent this year."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is receiving offers of billions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies from cities and states across North America that are participating in a company contest to pick a location for its second headquarters.\n\nElected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with \u201cHQ2.\u201d For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.\n\nAmazon has said it will announce a decision next year.\n\n\u201cThere is no better place to do business than Canada,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.\n\nNew Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor\u2019s office earlier this week.\n\nA report from the California governor\u2019s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state\u2019s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\nAnd in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon\u2019s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.\n\n\u201cThe cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,\u201d said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.\n\nSince its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.\n\nIn some cases, the contest has gotten heated.\n\nNew Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: \u201cWhen you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you\u2019ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city\u2019s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.\n\n\u201cWe consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,\u201d said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.\n\nMany governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.\n\nThe bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri\u2019s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.\n\nOther candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.\n\n\u201dHey Amazon, we need to talk,\u201c ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. \u201dWe\u2019re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find what you\u2019re looking for. But it\u2019s just not us,\u201d the ad read."
