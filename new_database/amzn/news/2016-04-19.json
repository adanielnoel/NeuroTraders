        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said it would offer its video streaming service as a monthly subscription as it looks to drive membership in its Prime bundle.\n\nAmazon Prime Video, which is the first service to be separated from the Prime service, will cost $8.99 per month, according to the company\u2019s website. At the same time, Amazon will offer its Prime subscription on a monthly basis for $10.99 per month.\n\nCurrent members of the Prime subscription service, which includes access to music and faster delivery options, pay $99 per year.\n\nNetflix Inc, which offers a similar video subscription service, could be hurt by the move, analysts said.\n\n\u201cAmazon certainly has the brand name, the customer relationships, and the focus on high-quality consumer experiences to impact the growth in Netflix\u2019s U.S. subscriber base,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note.\n\nAmazon\u2019s shares, which were marginally higher at midday on the Nasdaq, have fallen 7.4 percent this year.\n\nShares of Netflix, which will report its first-quarter results after the markets close on Monday, were down 3 percent."
