        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Online retailer Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday it would open a distribution centre in Bristol, south west England, in 2018, continuing a rapid expansion that saw its investments in the UK triple last year to over 400 million pounds ($513.96 million).\n\nBritain is Amazon\u2019s third-largest market outside North America, with sales of $9.5 billion last year -- up almost 20 percent in sterling terms on 2015.\n\nThe U.S. group already planned to open four additional distribution, or fulfilment, centres in 2017, in addition to the 12 operating at the end of last year.\n\nAmazon said it intended to hire an additional 1,000 workers at the Bristol plant on permanent contracts.\n\nFollowing criticism from politicians about weak worker protection, the company has been increasingly employing its warehouse staff directly, rather than indirectly via contract firms which offer little employment security.\n\nAmazon invested about 850 million pounds in the UK from 2010 to 2016, accounts for its UK subsidiaries show.\n\nIncreased use of robot technology contributed to the high capex spend last year, a spokesman said.\n\nThe company said that, including operating costs, Amazon had spent 6.4 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) in the UK since 2010, against sales of around 33 billion pounds.\n\nAmazon does not publish profitability figures for its UK operation. However, its main, Luxembourg-based European operating unit, through which all EU sales are routed, reported operating losses for the last six years, its accounts show.\n\nAmazon said last month it was not having problems hiring staff in Britain despite last year\u2019s Brexit vote."

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon\u2019s aggressive salesmanship now extends to its own debt. The e-commerce giant\u2019s blowout $16 billion bond sale suggests almost unlimited potential for the retailing juggernaut to consider even more shopping. Yet in nearly tripling its financial obligations to buy brick-and-mortar Whole Foods Market, Jeff Bezos\u2019 outfit is starting to look more traditional. The risk is that its stock will too.\n\nBezos built his online empire by investing cash flow back into the business and eschewing such conventional corporate-finance tools as debt and dividends. The result is a $472 billion goliath - the fifth-largest American enterprise by market capitalization - that has store owners and tech companies quaking over its ambitions.\n\nAmazon could have financed the Whole Foods deal by issuing stock with only minimal dilution to his 16.6 percent stake. But like Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk did last week, Bezos took the cheap money available in the fixed-income market. Investors submitted nearly $47 billion in bids, and the company was able to sell its paper at razor-thin margins, including a premium to comparable U.S. Treasuries of just 1.45 percentage points for $2.25 billion of 40-year bonds. A need for yield and a belief that Amazon will triumph from the retail shakeout it is provoking created a powerful cocktail.\n\nThe deal will nearly triple Amazon\u2019s outstanding debt, to a little over $23 billion. That\u2019s about a billion less than the consensus estimate for 2018 EBITDA. Given the company\u2019s cash pile, net debt will be even lower at under $10 billion. That leaves the under-leveraged Amazon with enough financial firepower to consider acquisitions that would make Whole Foods look like an appetizer.\n\nWhether that would be good for the company\u2019s stock is less clear. Belief in the Bezos vision has pushed Amazon shares up nearly 31 percent so far this year, and they are trading at 120 times 2018 estimated earnings as calculated by Eikon. Wal-Mart Stores, by contrast, fetches 17.6 times earnings. As Amazon begins to more closely resemble peers both in its physical footprint and its balance sheet, that gap will inevitably narrow.\n\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Its decision in June to buy premium grocer Whole Foods has signaled its move into other sectors and has also raised some questions about jobs."
