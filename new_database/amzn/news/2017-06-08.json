        "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) told some shoppers on Wednesday that there was a problem when they were trying to view product listings.\n\n\u201cSorry something went wrong on our end,\u201d Amazon said on a page some shoppers were sent to after clicking on items from its U.S. home page. A different image of a dog greeted users each time.\n\nMany shoppers took to Twitter to report the error message, which Reuters witnesses separately viewed. The incident appeared to start in the early afternoon Pacific Time and subside after 2 p.m. (2100 GMT).\n\nThe cause was not clear, and company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOutages are rare for Seattle-based Amazon, which prides itself on being a technology company, not simply a retailer.\n\nIn February, its cloud storage and computing business, Amazon Web Services, suffered a technical disruption. The widely felt outage underscored how enterprises from news sites to even Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rely on Amazon\u2019s cloud for some of their day-to-day operations.\n\nWednesday\u2019s glitch was unlikely to slow Amazon\u2019s growing control over consumers\u2019 wallets, however.\n\n\u201cA one-off outage for a couple hours in the middle of the day is not going to have a major impact,\u201d said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.\n\nThough \u201cit\u2019s never good,\u201d he added.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest online retailer averaged more than $151,000 in sales per minute in North America last year, reflecting lost opportunity from even short-lived disruptions."
