The U.S. company had agreed in principle to buy Souq.com.\n\nIn a report, investment bank Exotix listed possible concerns for minority shareholders in Emaar Malls\u2019 bid, including whether the online retail industry had synergies with retail mall management, and whether buying Souq.com would be an optimal allocation of capital.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amazon.com and Souq.com said jointly that Amazon had agreed to acquire the Middle Eastern firm, apparently ending the battle.\n\nSeven of Dubai\u2019s most heavily traded stocks fell and two were flat; Emaar Malls was the only gainer among them.\n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s index edged up 0.1 percent and Qatar rose 0.3 percent, buoyed by Vodafone Qatar, which gained 4.4 percent and was the most heavily traded stock.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian index rose 0.3 percent. Saudi Automotive, which offers services to motorists, saw unusually heavy trading and was the most active stock; it surged 4.1 percent.\n\nRiyad Bank lost 1.9 percent and Saudi Public Transport fell 3.0 percent as the two stocks went ex-dividend.\n\nIn Kuwait, Kuwait Insurance Co sank 3.6 percent as it went ex-dividend but the market index gained 0.3 percent.\n\n* The index edged up 0.1 percent to 4,470 points.\n\n* The index edged up 0.1 percent to 12,983 points."
