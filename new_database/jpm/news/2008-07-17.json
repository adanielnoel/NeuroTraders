        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a smaller-than-expected drop in earnings on resilient stock and bond underwriting revenue, sending its shares surging, but the company cautioned that the mortgage market and the economy are getting worse.\n\nThe bank\u2019s second-quarter profit fell more than 50 percent to $2 billion, hurt by $1.1 billion in write-downs at its investment bank and charges linked to the bank\u2019s acquisition of Bear Stearns.\n\nBut even amid write-downs, the third-largest U.S. bank generated stronger than expected results, helped by underwriting and bond trading.\n\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t as bad as the market has feared,\u201d said Thomas Russo, partner and portfolio manager at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nJPMorgan Chase posted net income of 54 cents a share, compared with $4.23 billion, or $1.20 a share, in the same quarter last year. Total revenue rose to $18.399 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 44 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nThe results triggered a broad rally in financial stocks a day after Wells Fargo & Co reported surprisingly strong results that also lifted bank stocks.\n\nJPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has managed to sidestep the worst of the credit crisis that has forced massive write-downs at Wall Street firms.\n\nThe third-largest U.S. bank has been benefiting from rivals\u2019 weakness and is gaining market share in multiple businesses because of it, Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nJPMorgan is still open to buying a regional bank while the sector is depressed, Dimon said, adding that although accounting rules related to taking on a weak bank\u2019s balance sheet make a purchase more difficult, it is still possible.\n\nDimon sounded some ominous notes in a conference call, saying the bank is prepared for losses on prime mortgages to triple and adding that unlike Wells Fargo, the bank has no plans to boost its dividend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to increase the dividend until we see clear daylight,\u201d he said. The company currently pays 38 cents per share quarterly.\n\nJPMorgan set aside an additional $1.3 billion during the second quarter as a buffer against further losses.\n\nThe bank will also not record a gain from its Bear Stearns purchase in May, which it had previously hoped would contribute $1 billion. JPMorgan had agreed in March to buy Bear Stearns after the fifth-largest U.S. securities firm faced a run on the bank.\n\nThe acquisition of Bear Stearns instead contributed $540 million of losses and charges.\n\nBut there were glimmers of good news as well. CFO Cavanagh said the pace of deterioration in home equity -- a big drag for many banks -- is slowing. And other businesses are performing solidly -- investment banking fees of $1.7 billion are the second-highest ever at the bank.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares rose $3.90 or 10.9 percent to $39.84.\n\nJPMorgan paid out 57 percent of its investment banking revenue as compensation, which is a relatively high level -- banks typically aim for a compensation ratio closer to 50 percent.\n\nDimon said the bank\u2019s compensation ratio is likely to normalize, but jokingly added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want our people getting depressed.\u201d\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s close, JPMorgan\u2019s shares were down 15 percent this year, compared with a 35 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index. But since Tuesday\u2019s close, the bank\u2019s shares have risen more than 25 percent.\n\nIn response to the results, the cost to insure JPMorgan debt against a default with credit default swaps fell 5 basis points to 115 basis points, or $115,000 per year to insure $10 million of debt for five years, according to Phoenix Partners Group.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of capital strength, rose to 9.1 percent from 8.4 percent in the same quarter last year -- though it would have been 8.1 percent without regulatory relief stemming from the Bear Stearns takeover, which was assisted by federal regulators.\n\nRegulators consider a bank with a Tier 1 ratio above 6 percent to be well capitalized.",

        "body": "BEIJING, July 17 (Reuters) - Investment banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan trimmed their 2008 growth forecasts for China and ruled out any interest rate rises this year after the government said that growth slowed to 10.1 percent in the second quarter.\n\nEconomists at both banks said they expected China to continue increasing banks' required reserve ratio, strengthening the yuan CNY=CFXS and controlling bank loans, though JPMorgan noted the possibility of some relaxation of these tightening measures if growth slows more sharply.\n\nRate rises, however, would be off the table this year, as Beijing is loath to widen the yuan-dollar interest rate differential and invite more of the capital inflows that have so complicated China\u2019s monetary policy, both banks said.\n\nGoldman Sachs revised down its projections of gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 10.1 percent for 2008 and 9.5 percent for 2009, which would mark the first time growth dropped below double digits since 2002. Previously, Goldman had called for 10.5 percent growth this year and 10.0 percent next year.\n\nGoldman economists Hong Liang and Yu Song said lower contributions from net exports and investment would serve as drags, while consumption would remain strong.\n\nThey also changed their interest rate projections, dropping an earlier forecast for two rate rises by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe no longer expect any hikes to benchmark interest rates this year, and believe the pressures on interest rates will mostly transpire into currency appreciation pressures given the concerns on capital inflows,\u201d Liang and Song wrote in a note to clients.\n\nJPMorgan nudged its growth forecast for 2008 down to 10.2 percent from 10.5 percent, saying the export outlook was a concern but that a domestic fiscal boost, including infrastructure investment and corporate subsidies, would pick up the slack.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will put off raising interest rates until late in the first quarter of 2009 but will then increase rates four times that year, taking its cue from the U.S. Federal Reserve, JPMorgan economists forecast in a note.\n\n\u201cIn the near term, the central bank is likely to keep its focus on liquidity management, especially through open market operations and issuance of PBoC bills,\u201d they said.\n\nAnnual gross domestic product growth slowed to 10.1 percent in the second quarter from 10.6 percent in the first three months of the year and 11.9 percent in all of 2007, the National Bureau of Statistics said earlier.",

        "body": "NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed over 1 percent on Thursday as oil prices dropped sharply for the third day, while banks rallied after stronger-than-expected results from JPMorgan Chase & Co increased optimism about the current earnings season.\n\nOil prices fell more than $5, dropping below $130 a barrel for the first time in over a month. The steep decline in oil futures prices reduced concerns about inflation and the impact of possibly higher rates on the fragile U.S. economy.\n\nShares of JP Morgan (JPM.N) jumped 12 percent after the third-largest U.S. bank posted profit above Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) rose nearly 13 percent and Citigroup (C.N) gained over 8 percent.\n\nThe news supported investor optimism about corporate earnings, one day after Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s (WFC.N) results catapulted financial stocks to their biggest gains in almost two decades.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N also benefited from the rally in financials, soaring 20 percent or more in a second day of sharp gains. They were further boosted by news that Freddie pulled off its second successful debt sale following Sunday\u2019s announcement of a U.S. rescue plan for the two huge housing finance companies.\n\n\u201cIn order to have a sustainable rally, what you need is oil prices coming down, and some good earnings numbers coming out,\u201d said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 162.11 points, or 1.44 percent, at 11,401.39, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 10.01 points, or 0.80 percent, to 1,255.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shot up 28.46 points, or 1.25 percent, to 2,313.31.\n\nIn general, the first batch of corporate earnings has positively surprised analysts, who currently expect S&P 500 company earnings to decline by 16.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters proprietary research released on Thursday. Financial companies\u2019 earnings are seen falling 76 percent.\n\nUnited Technologies (UTX.N) was among the companies posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Shares of the diversified manufacturer rose 5.3 percent to $64.36 on the results.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO.N) and e-Bay (EBAY.O) also beat analysts\u2019 profit estimates, but shares of the world\u2019s largest soft-drinks company fell 4 percent to $50.24 on mounting evidence that the weakening U.S. economy is taking a toll on its performance. [ID:nN17256203]\n\nShares of eBay slipped 14.2 percent to $24.12 after the Internet auctioner issued a cautious near-term outlook that led to downgrades by several Wall Street analysts.\n\nCrucial information about the current earnings season will be available later on Thursday as Merrill Lynch MER.N, Google (GOOG.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and International Business Machines (IBM.N) are expected to report earnings after the market closes.
