        "body": "NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), showed his famous brash side as he gave a recruiting pitch on the turf of a rival firm on Tuesday.\n\nTaking questions at Merrill Lynch\u2019s banking and financial services conference, from an audience including executives and analysts from rivals, he made the pitch -- a sign of confidence in his company as the fallout of huge Wall Street losses is expected to cause a talent exodus at the most troubled firms.\n\n\u201cIf any of you think you\u2019re good and you\u2019re looking for a job or something like that, feel free to give me a call,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cBecause we will be hiring.\u201d\n\nHis pitch might have a broad appeal at Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N. The company does not have a CEO after the ouster of Stan O\u2018Neal, blamed for the biggest quarterly loss in company history.\n\nDimon was in an irreverent mood. He began his presentation mocking the bronchitis of Morgan Stanley (MS.N) co-President Zoe Cruz, who attended the event but could not make her presentation because of a case of bronchitis.\n\n\u201cCan everyone hear me?\u201d Dimon said as he started. Then in a croaky whisper, he joked, \u201cI have a bad throat.\u201d\n\nDimon also twitted other companies, saying that as they scramble to shore up failed risk management or find their next CEO, he\u2019s willing to make decisions now that don\u2019t necessarily have an immediate payoff.\n\nHe said it\u2019s OK if the earnings pop from JPMorgan\u2019s strategic moves don\u2019t start paying off until 2009 and beyond.\n\nDimon\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip style makes him a standout on Wall Street, where many executives stick to a script to convey a carefully worded corporate message.\n\nOnce a top protege of former Citigroup (C.N) Chairman Sandy Weill, Dimon fell out of favor and was ousted. Years later, Weill told television interviewer Charlie Rose that Dimon had been a little \u201cobstreperous.\u201d\n\nToday, Citigroup shares are down 36 percent this year amid multibillion-dollar write-downs and the exodus of CEO Chuck Prince. Citigroup\u2019s problems include exposure to structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, which are assets linked to subprime mortgages and other debt.\n\n\u201cSIVs don\u2019t have a business purpose,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThey will go the way of the dinosaur.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, JPMorgan does not have SIV exposure and its write-downs on other risky assets have been much smaller than those of Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. JPMorgan shares are down 7 percent this year.\n\nWhen discussing JPMorgan\u2019s exposure to subprime mortgage-related assets, Dimon said, \u201cWe think we\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nBut he also cautioned that the bank\u2019s positions contain risk.\n\nDimon said subprime lending won\u2019t go away, because it is a good business.\n\n\u201cIt was something good that went way to excess,\u201d he said. \u201cBut remember subprime is minority groups, younger folks, immigrants, people who had problems earlier in their life. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nHe later said, \u201cIt is not a big deal for the U.S. economy and certainly a much smaller deal for the world economy.\u201d (Editing by Braden Reddall)",
