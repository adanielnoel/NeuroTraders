        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Sunday it would buy stricken rival Bear Stearns for just $2 a share in an all-stock deal valuing the fifth largest investment bank at about $236 million.\n\nIn a surprise move to stem the fast-spreading debt crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve also lowered the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks to 3.25 percent, effective immediately, and announced a new lending program under through it which will lend to other big financial firms.\n\nU.S. stock index futures gained on initial news of the Fed moves but then fell sharply on Sunday evening as investors worried that fallout from a global credit crunch will continue to spread, damaging more banks and undermining the financial system.\n\nAsian stocks also fell while the dollar sank to a record low against the euro and a fresh 12-year low against the yen. Treasuries climbed and Gold hit a record high as the Fed move failed to calm panicky investors.\n\nTo read all stories on Bear Stearns, click on, for all stories about the Fed moves, click on\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fight the inflationary implications. That\u2019s not the battle of the day. You\u2019ll worry about that later ... The battle of the moment is trying to maintain the financial system and not having a complete break down. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at. You\u2019re having a run on confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have enough transparency in the financial system to have confidence ... We still have no understanding of how structured debt products and their derivatives will play out.\u201d\n\n\u201cGold is still going to find broader participation ... It is certainly going to find some strength through the week.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe Bear Stearns announcement highlights the risks facing the banking sector as the reporting season gets going. I think a lot of investors are parking money in gold.\n\n\u201cInvestors will want to move their money as far from the United States as possible and Australian and Asia resource stocks might be a good play.\u201d\n\nON BEAR STEARNS: \u201cI think its scary for what it says about the value of financial assets, if a company is worth only a small percentage of book value. But what we need to see is that counterparties are being stopped from failing and this deal does that. The futures falling is a knee-jerk reaction. This deal had to happen, and JPMorgan is the best candidate for this because their capital position is stronger and their sources of funding is stronger. I do think this is the best possible scenario for financial markets.\u201d\n\nON FED DISCOUNT RATE CUT: \u201cI guess the Fed cutting the discount rate is more of the same, they\u2019re trying to boost liquidity, but there\u2019s no sense, that this last cut in the discount rate will change anything at all.\u201d\n\n\u201dThey don\u2019t have an impact big enough to change the negative market mood. The discount rate cut was only 25 basis points, and the Bear Stearns move simply averted the worst case.\n\n\u201cFor the Japanese market to reverse the fall, we have to wait for the end of the Fed\u2019s rate cut cycle, meaning the end of the U.S. economic slowdown. Japanese stocks are seen by foreign investors as sensitive to U.S. economic cycles.\u201d\n\n\u201dThese are quite speedy responses by the U.S. authorities. Quick measures like these make investors wonder if it is all right to keep on selling (stocks and the dollar).\n\n\u201cWe are entering a phase where we need to think about potential risks of just sticking to the selling side. These developments should have some effects of dulling downward momentum, although the effects do not seem to have emerged yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s discount rate cut is nothing more than a quick-fix policy and may not be taken as a much of surprise by investors after the acquisition of Bear Stearns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe string of reports about Bear Stearns had a huge impact on investor confidence as credit markets have broken down.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, Bear Stearns was hit by a crisis of confidence and bit of a liquidity run, so they are gone. The Fed has just backed JP Morgan to buyout Bear Stearns. That is sort of consolidation. The Fed stepping in to provide support might give a degree of support to the market but it is hard to see huge amount of confidence coming back into the financial sector in the short-term.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe cut in the discount rate suggests that the Fed is trying to narrow the gap with the cash rate and make it less expensive for borrowing funds. But risk flares will continue and the U.S. dollar will weaken as write-offs in the problem areas are looking up. Irrespective of the decision on Sunday, I think the Fed will do what it has to do on Tuesday with regard to the cash rate (at its scheduled meeting to review interest rates).\n\n\u201dBonds will benefit, but the fact that the U.S. dollar is under pressure and gold is surging suggests a loss of face for some currencies.\n\n\u201cThe Bear Stearns acquisition is a back-stop move and I think the credit crunch has still some way to go and there would be a few more months of strife ahead. The U.S. economy is weakening and there is no point being impatient about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bear Stearns development was anticipated but it\u2019s still a source of nervousness for the markets. The fear is how many more skeletons in the closet are still there in the global credit markets?\u201d\n\nOn Fed rate cuts and liquidity initiatives: \u201dThis is another effort by the Fed to calm things down, but the cloud on the horizon is just how much more of these credit issues are still out there. And we won\u2019t know until we see the U.S. housing market bottoming out.\n\n\u201cThe Fed can try to smooth out the availability of credit but as long as the fear dimension is in the market, it is difficult to assure the availability of bank credit.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe big question is what will be the effort on the real world economy. For now that is still being supported by healthy export demand from China and the oil producing countries.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s whole motivation at this point is to prevent bad debt from affecting good debt through a traditional run on the bank,\u201d said \u201cThe only way to prevent this is for the Federal Reserve to come into the market and be the lender of last resort.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have been surprised if the Fed hadn\u2019t (moved) given the turmoil in the financial industry and the events that emerged with Bear Stearns last week .... If they hadn\u2018t, for the equities market it would have been all over but for the crying.\u201d\n\n\u201dDesperate times need desperate measures. The Federal Reserve is doing what it takes to restore stability and it means cutting the discount rate on a Sunday night in the U.S., then so be it.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Federal Reserve is responsive has got to be comfort to investors. There may be more bad news out there but investors should take the view that the Fed is not going to sit idly by.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short-term measure. They are using all the tools they can and I don\u2019t expect any market rebound.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarket players are afraid that there will be the second and third Bear Stearns out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that this transaction looks like it has been stitched up very, very quickly shows the urgency that the Federal Reserve had applied to this and no doubt that it sat down with the parties to ensure that the situation can be attended to straight away.\u201d",

Shares in the fifth largest U.S. investment bank, which employs more than 14,000 people, hit a record high of more than $171 in January 2007.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Bear Stearn\u2019s board is letting these assets go at such a deep discount brings into question the value of assets on a lot of corporate balance sheets,\u201d said Timothy Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in New York.\n\n\u201cThe main concern is what other financial institutions are worth in the current environment, given the discount that JP Morgan is acquiring Bear at.\u201d\n\nBear Stearns\u2019 cash reserves were drained by fleeing customers on Thursday, and on Friday the bank secured emergency funding from the Federal Reserve, extended through JPMorgan. [nN16500718]\n\nUnder the deal, the Federal Reserve will provide special financing and has agreed to fund up to $30 billion of Bear Stearns\u2019 less liquid assets.\n\n\u201cIn doing our due diligence, that was an area we needed to get comfort upon, some of the more illiquid assets on the balance sheet,\u201d JPMorgan chief financial officer Michael Cavanaugh said on a conference call late on Sunday. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be in stronger hands than to be arranged for financing through the Federal Reserve, with no recourse to JPM Chase.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, JPMorgan said it would exchange 0.05473 shares of its stock for one share of Bear Stearns\u2019 stock. It is guaranteeing the trading obligations of Bear Stearns and its subsidiaries.\n\nAsked how JPMorgan reconciled the $2 a share it was paying with the book value Bear Stearns gave on Friday of mid-80 cents per share, an executive said on the call: \u201cIt\u2019s an art not a science. There are a thousand moving pieces... that got reflected in the final price that JPMorgan agreed to pay.\u201d\n\nThe deal has to go to shareholder vote.\n\nJPMorgan said on the call it had every expectation shareholders will approve this deal and that it would \u201cbe surprised if a better alternative came along.\u201d\n\nBut one person who phoned into the call identifying himself as an individual investor said he wouldn\u2019t be voting for it.\n\nDeal-related costs would total $6 billion, Cavanaugh said, which includes costs of litigation, de-leveraging, conforming accounting and severance costs.\n\nCavanaugh said Bear Stearns had $16 billion exposure to commercial mortgage backed securities assets and $15 billion exposure to prime, Alt-A mortgages -- mortgages given to people with relatively high credit scores who can\u2019t document their income -- and $2 billion exposure to subprime.\n\nThe bank, however, sees $1 billion in earnings accretion when Bear Stearns is fully integrated, with the leading contributor to that being Bear\u2019s prime brokerage business, which finances and processes trades for hedge funds.\n\nJPMorgan, which in 2007, reported income of $15.4 billion, has a relatively small prime brokerage business, and at the bank\u2019s investor day in February, Bill Winters, co-head of investment banking, said it might make sense to acquire one.\n\nJPMorgan said on Sunday that its current estimate of Tier One ratio, a measure of capital adequacy, at closing of the deal, was 8 percent. Banks usually strive to keep it above 7.5 percent.\n\nJPMorgan said there was no material adverse change (MAC) clause written into the deal, as it was a \u201cdeal we all want to see close.\u201d It sees the deal to buy Bear Stearns closing in about 90 days.\n\nBear Stearns would still be open for business, a JPMorgan executive said on the call, with the acquisition helping to avoid a fire sale of Bear Stearn\u2019s assets. Bear\u2019s positions would be de-levered in an orderly fashion, JPMorgan said.\n\nBear Stearns\u2019 chief executive, Alan Schwartz, said in a statement the deal represented the \u201cbest outcome for all of our constituencies based upon the current circumstances.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s chief executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement: \u201cBear Stearns\u2019 clients and counterparties should feel secure that JPMorgan is guaranteeing Bear Stearns\u2019 counterparty risk.\u201d\n\nBear Stearns said in a separate statment that it wouldn\u2019t be reporting its quarterly earnings on Monday, as previously scheduled, due to the deal.\n\n(For more stories on JPMorgan\u2019s planned acquisition of Bear Stearns, and on the latest Federal Reserve emergency moves, click on [nN16640873]",

In terms of office space, that is roughly three times the equivalent of London\u2019s landmark \u201cGherkin\u201d.\n\nJP Morgan said last May that it was in talks with the City of London and developer Hammerson (HMSO.L) over a proposed new 1 million square foot European headquarters in London\u2019s City financial district.\n\nAn agreement has yet to be finalized.\n\nFurther east in Canary Wharf -- London\u2019s second financial district -- the steel husk of another unfinished tower bears testimony to the plans Bear Stearns had to consolidate its London-based workforce in one building.\n\nJPMorgan is now in line to inherit the 300,000 square foot Canary Wharf development at 5 Churchill Place, which is due to complete in mid-2009.\n\nJP Morgan declined to comment on its plans or whether a decision was imminent.\n\nA second London office broker agent said the Bear Stearns takeover was unlikely to derail JP Morgan\u2019s London City office blueprint, because Bear Stearns\u2019s unfinished building could yet be sublet to third party.\n\nBut for others it may not be that simple.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done in terms of their portfolio of buildings in London, future headcount, and what that means in terms of future property strategy should they wish to dispose of anything,\u201d said a third office broker.\n\nHe said office lettings in the City in the first two months of 2008 were in line with the historic market average, despite a \u201cnoticeable slowdown\u201d in leasing from tenants with large plate requirements above 100,000 square feet.\n\nThere was also no clear evidence of falling rents for prime City offices, but incentive packages such as rent-free periods had increased by up to 6 months since the autumn, he said.\n\n\u201cIf the trend of slowing demand from the financial sector continues, then this, coupled with the increase in speculative office supply in 2008/2009, is likely to put a downward pressure on rents in the City,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to data from Savills (SVS.L), 13 million square feet of new office space is projected to come on stream in 2008 and 2009 in London\u2019s West End and City markets. Only 3 million square feet of that was pre-let.\n\nJPMorgan will have to pay up to 8.34 million pounds ($16.44 million) in annual rent on behalf of Bear, which agreed to occupy 206,000 square feet on a 20-year lease and already occupies around 150,000 square feet of space at 0ne Canada Square, Canary Wharf\u2019s signature skyscraper.\n\nJPMorgan has 12 months to decide whether it will occupy the space itself, or whether it should hunt for a sub-tenant to share the burden of a 40.50 pounds annual per square foot rent.\n\n(See www.reutersrealestate.com for the global service for real estate professionals from Reuters).",

        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase has bought stricken rival Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom $2 a share, while the U.S. Federal Reserve has expanded lending to securities firms for the first time since the Great Depression.\n\nThe shock weekend news sent European shares tumbling in Monday\u2019s early trade, with investors rattled by fears of contagion.\n\nThe following are analysts\u2019 comments on the moves.\n\n\u201dDespite Bernstein\u2019s price targets, which imply an average of 44 percent upside potential over the next six to twelve months, we would NOT recommend getting into the large capitalization names at this time.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate events at Bear Stearns will lead to sharply increasing funding pressure on the other four large capitalization brokers (Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley) in the near term. And although these four companies have strong capital bases and capable corporate treasuries and repo desks, investing in the brokers now is a bet on a recovery of confidence in credit markets that are experiencing the worst turmoil in several decades.\u201d\n\n\u201dIf you get a crisis of confidence in the wholesale banking space and something the size of Bear Stearns could go under, then people start to panic. You get a real fear factor.\n\nWhat happens to the investment banking model? If you lose confidence in that kind of situation, the business model collapses.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the middle of these things it feels like there\u2019s an ever looming crisis but we have seen things like this before. In 1998 and 2002/03 it was sharper and more dramatic. What might be different is the speed at which we recover. It may be a lot slower.\u201d\n\n\u201dThese events are driven as much by psychology as by underlying facts. Hence no assurances can be given that the banks in our coverage are safe from a similar liquidity crunch.\n\nHowever, credit default swap spreads as of close of business on Friday indicate that all three of the European capital markets banks are perceived to have materially less counterparty risk than Bear Stearns had prior to the start of their recent liquidity troubles. All three have direct access to central bank funding and own assets such as their wealth management and retail franchises, which are highly cash generative and could theoretically be sold in times of high stress.\n\nGiven that one of the major players in this industry, though it was the smallest and most exposed to fixed income earnings, had experienced something not far off a run on the bank, we recommend investors maintain extreme caution on the European capital markets banks. We would expect the stocks to sell off from here, irrespective of longer term outlooks.\u201d\n\n\u201dWe are getting close to a bottom because the panic is setting in and banks are starting to go bust.\n\nUntil this system is cleaned we will not rebound. We had a bubble in the credit markets and it needs to pop. I am seriously looking at JPMorgan, it looks like they got a bargain -- $2 per share, it is less than their real estate holdings. I would not jump in yet, but there are going to be some great opportunities in the weeks to come.\u201d\n\n\u201dSo, what to do now? Sell your banks. Banks themselves must be tightening their credit and risk models even further, leading to even greater pressure despite any further rate cuts.\n\nThis means two things - higher funding costs and higher impairment charges, with the added concern that capital cushions could quickly disappear if funding concerns result in massive withdrawals. One thing to watch will be LIBOR, which we expect will rise even further and the 68 bp (basis point) LIBOR-BR (bank rate) gap is wide enough as it is already.\n\nWe have had the UK banks on underweight, and most of those banks on \u201dsell\u201c since August 2007; if anything, we think the situation has worsened even beyond our bearish expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201dA flood of liquidity-orientated proposals by the Fed/U.S. government in the last seven days, culminating in the rescue of Bear Stearns, are unlikely to mark the end to the turbulence in the financial markets in our view.\n\n(While) not wishing to lose sight of long-term fundamentals, we would remain cautious on the European investment banks in the present environment.\u201d\n\n\u201dWe believe that JPMorgan is acting as the stability agent for the Fed in this transaction and that the concern for the $2.5 trillion in notional counterparty exposure trumps the interest of the existing Bear Stearns shareholder.\n\nA company is only as solvent as the perception of its solvency. When a company that is leveraged over 30-to-1 faces crisis of liquidity and confidence of creditworthiness, that company will be unable to leverage collateral and its leverage will be forced down to one-to-one. BSC\u2019s equity could become worthless. Forced sales create asset deflation, which could cause cannibalization of remaining capital.\u201d\n\n\u201dWe surmise Bears Stearns felt intense pressure to find a buyer quickly amid a crisis of confidence, and JPMorgan was best positioned to act, allowing it to win favorable pricing.\n\nWe believe the purchase of Bear Stearns is a plus for JPM as it adds prime brokerage capabilities and scale in other areas.\n\nStill, what the valuation JPM paid says for the valuation of financial assets in general could be disconcerting to bank stock investors, although we note Bear Stearns was under considerable liquidity strain over the past week.\u201d",

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon\u2019s grab of Bear Stearns may turn into one of the biggest bargains in recent years.\n\nBanking experts were almost unanimous in their appraisal of the move by JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is run by Dimon, to buy Wall Street rival Bear Stearns Cos Inc.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that this represents a great bargain for JPMorgan,\u201d said Samuel Hayes, emeritus professor of finance at Harvard Business School.\n\n\u201cBear Stearns was, until this year, one of the smartest and most profitable investment banks in the world,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cThis could be a real money-spinner for JPMorgan.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan agreed on Sunday to buy Bear Stearns, which was slammed by a sudden cash crunch, for about $2 a share -- about 90 percent below its Friday close. The all-stock deal values the company, recently ranked as the No. 5 U.S. investment bank, at about $236 million.\n\nBrad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, estimated that a breakup of Bear Stearns would fetch $7.7 billion. \u201cThis is a tremendous bargain for JPMorgan shareholders,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nThe deal will cost JPMorgan more than just stock. The bank is setting aside $6 billion to cover deal-related costs such as litigation and severance, putting the total cost much higher.\n\n\u201cEven with an estimated $6 billion of transaction costs, the deal economics look very compelling,\u201d said Citibank analyst Keith Horowitz.\n\n\u201cFrom a strategic perspective JPMorgan is getting several business lines from Bear that are very complementary to its investment bank,\u201d Horowitz said in a note to clients.\n\nDimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has developed a reputation as a turnaround specialist since bouncing back from being ousted from Citigroup Inc a decade ago.\n\nHe\u2019ll need those skills to integrate cash-strapped Bear Stearns into JPMorgan\u2019s financial empire, which includes car loans, credit cards, and investment banking.\n\n\u201cDimon negotiated well,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a note, but added that the deal \u201cdoes not come without risk.\u201d\n\nInvestors cheered Dimon\u2019s move, boosting JPMorgan\u2019s stock as much as 12.5 percent despite a broader sell-off in the financial sector. The Standard & Poor\u2019s financials index fell 1.4 percent, marking its lowest level in almost five years.\n\nThe deal, which includes $30 billion in special Federal Reserve financing for Bear Stearns\u2019 less liquid assets, followed an emergency funding package on Friday for Bear Stearns by JPMorgan through the Federal Reserve after its liquidity deteriorated significantly.\n\nSome saw the quick deal turnaround as a reason for caution. \u201cThe issue is what is Bear Stearns really worth,\u201d said Jim Huguet, chief executive of Great Companies LLC, a Tampa, Florida, investment adviser. \u201cI\u2018m not sure you can answer that in two or three days.\u201d\n\nBut Dimon has a good track record fixing up major banks. After being ousted from Citibank a decade ago, he became CEO of Bank One in 2000, fixing it up and eventually selling the bank to JPMorgan in 2004.\n\nHe has kept JPMorgan, which posted a 6 percent rise in 2007 net profit, largely unscarred by the credit crisis ravaging the financial sector.\n\nJPMorgan, the No. 2 U.S. bank by market value, expects the acquisition, which includes Bear Stearns\u2019 profitable clearing and prime brokerage businesses, to add $1 billion to earnings once it is fully integrated.\n\nJPMorgan shares closed up $3.77, or 10.3 percent, at $40.31 on the New York Stock Exchange, where they traded as high as $41.09 during Monday\u2019s session. Bear Stearns shares closed at $4.81, down 84 percent.",
