        "body": "Oct 24 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its 2009 earnings outlook for European chemical companies by an average of 13 percent, and downgraded four stocks in the sector, citing a significantly weaker demand in developed markets and slower growth in emerging markets.\n\nThe brokerage said it expects a destocking cycle to magnify volume weakness as early as third quarter of 2008, driven by an uncertain demand outlook, sharply falling oil price and tightening credit coupled with a need to conserve cash.\n\nJP Morgan said while fundamental value now exists for the sector as a recent sell off has opened up good longer-term valuation opportunities, it expects \u201cvalue to continue to take a back seat, in favour of earnings security and visibility.\u201d\n\nThe brokerage downgraded BASF BASF.DE and Lanxess (LXSG.DE) to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d and Akzo Nobel NV (AKZO.AS) and DSM (DSMN.AS) to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\nHowever, it raised Syngenta SYNN.VX to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d on reassuring strong third-quarter sales.\n\nThe following table lists the price target changes -\n\n* Swiss francs (Reporting by Jose Kottanani in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)",
