        "body": "LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Global services and manufacturing activity contracted even faster in February and data suggests the first quarter of 2009 may be as bad as the end of 2008, JP Morgan said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Global Total Output Index, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organisations, fell to 38.4 in February from 40.3 in January, well below the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction.\n\n\u201cThe fallback in the headline activity index raises the possibility of the global downturn remaining as deep in Q1 2009 as the sharp decline in GDP seen at the end of last year,\u201d said David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan.\n\nThe global service sector indicator remained in negative territory for the ninth consecutive month, sinking to 39.8 in February from 43.0 the month before, as rates of contraction accelerated in the U.S., the euro zone and Australia.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday the ISM index covering the U.S. non-manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, showed the sector shrank further in February, but by less than expected.\n\nThe 16-nation euro zone\u2019s dominant service sector sank still deeper into recession during February as new business levels plummeted and firms slashed jobs, but in China and the UK it may have hit the bottom, earlier data suggested.\n\nThe index combines data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.

        "body": "* Very active start to the year in debt and equity issues\n\nLONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - British investment bank JPMorgan Cazenove posted a 15 percent fall in full-year pretax profit and said it had seen a \u201cvery active\u201d start to 2009 in debt and equity issues.\n\n\u201cIf we got close to repeating the profits for 2008 in 2009, we\u2019d regard that as a pretty good result,\u201d chief executive Naguib Kheraj told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nPretax profit in 2008 was 134.5 million pounds ($190 million), the joint venture between British broker Cazenove [CAZ.UL] and JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said.\n\n\u201cLast year, the businesses that we\u2019ve come out of lost money. Hopefully, we will not have the losses that we had in those businesses in 2008,\u201d Kheraj said.\n\nHeadcount fell by a quarter during 2008 after the firm sold its Asian business to Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and exited France and Germany.

        "body": "NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Wednesday said it may cut its ratings on Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and changed its outlook on JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to negative, from stable, indicating it is more likely to be cut over the next one to two years.\n\nMoody\u2019s currently rates both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan \u201cAa3,\u201d its fourth highest investment grade.\n\nThe review on Wells Fargo \u201cwas prompted by a concern that Wells Fargo\u2019s capital ratios could deteriorate in 2009 from their current levels, which are comparatively low, because of the potential need to take high loan loss provisions in 2009,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a statement.\n\nThe bank\u2019s low capital ratios \u201cresult from the fact that the equity Wells Fargo raised for its purchase of Wachovia was, in Moody\u2019s view, modest in comparison to the amount and quality of the acquired Wachovia assets,\u201d it added.\n\nCapital generation at the bank may be constrained as Wells Fargo will need to record provisions and merger-related expenses in 2009 and 2010 against assets at Wachovia that were not marked down on Dec. 31, 2008, Moody\u2019s said.\n\nThe review for possible downgrade is expected to be completed by the end of March.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s outlook was revised to negative, meanwhile, on concerns the bank\u2019s results will be \u201csaddled by sustained high provisions and credit costs for the coming four to six quarters, due to increasing financial strains for U.S. consumers and the global recession,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.\n\n\u201cAs a result, JPMorgan\u2019s capital generation could be modest at best,\u201d the credit ratings agency said.\n\nThe cost to insure the debt of JPMorgan with credit default swaps rose 10 basis points on Wednesday to around 190 basis points, or $190,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt.",
