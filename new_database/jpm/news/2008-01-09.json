Morgan Securities upgraded Federated Investors Inc (FII.N), a leading money market fund manager, to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral,\u201d citing strength in money market fund asset growth.\n\nAnalyst Kenneth Worthington, who raised his fiscal 2008 earnings view for Pittsburgh-based Federated on expectations of higher money market sales, said he saw some improvements in the firm\u2019s equity and fixed income franchises.\n\n\u201cSolid money market performance in difficult market conditions seems to be leading to a flight to quality, with investors increasingly migrating to Federated money funds,\u201d Worthington wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHe said structured investment vehicle exposure at Federated was limited to the highest quality products and exposure continued to be actively reduced.\n\nMoney market funds have long been popular with investors because they promise to return the dollar investors put in. They attracted more money than usual in August and September last year, when subprime mortgage problems came to a head and investors fled to safety.\n\nWorthington raised his fiscal 2008 earnings view for the company to $2.70 a share from his prior view of $2.54 a share.\n\nShares of the company closed at $38.93 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
