        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N could fetch a higher takeover bid from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), and at $6 its shares constitute a \u201creasonable speculative bet\u201d that one will be forthcoming, Barron\u2019s said in in March 24 edition.\n\nOn March 16, the stricken Bear agreed to a $236 million all-stock buyout by JPMorgan, valuing the company at about $2 per share. That value has since risen to about $2.52 per share because JPMorgan stock has since risen.\n\nBear shares closed Thursday at $6.39, a premium to the merger price, because some investors hope the company will find another buyer or JPMorgan will increase its offer.\n\nThe merger requires shareholder approval. Some investors, including Joseph Lewis, who has lost some $1 billion on his Bear investment, have said the terms could be better.\n\nBarron\u2019s said a sweetened JPMorgan offer is more likely than an alternative bid. It said few financial companies have the capacity to take on Bear\u2019s obligations, or would want to upset federal regulators that blessed the transaction. It also said private equity firms lack the means to make counterbids.\n\nIn addition, the newspaper said JPMorgan included deterrents to potential bidders, including an option to buy Bear\u2019s glittering Manhattan headquarters for $1.1 billion.\n\nBarron\u2019s said JPMorgan isn\u2019t commenting, but might raise the price to clinch the merger and quell critics. It said JPMorgan could easily pay $1 billion to $2 billion more for Bear, especially after netting $1.3 billion of cash last week from Visa Inc\u2019s (V.N) initial public offering.",
