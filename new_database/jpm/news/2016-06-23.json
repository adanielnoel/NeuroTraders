Morgan said its analysis of recent opinion polls on Britain\u2019s European Union membership referendum showed the \u201cIn\u201d camp was narrowly ahead on Wednesday, a day before Britons go to the polls.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of the data in hand, our clean-up process suggests a 2 percentage-point lead on average for \u2018Remain\u2019 in the polls published this week, with around 9 percent of the vote undecided,\u201d J.P. Morgan economist Malcolm Barr said in an email.\n\n\u201cOur measure of the trend through the week-to-week noise now sits at a 0.6 percentage-point lead for \u2018Remain\u2019.\u201d\n\nBarr added that \u201csubjectively\u201d, he saw a roughly 45 percent chance Britain would leave the EU compared to the 25 percent chance priced into betting markets.",
