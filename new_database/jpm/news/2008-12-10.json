        "body": "Dec 10 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Axsys Technologies Inc AXYS.O, a provider of surveillance and imaging solutions, to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201don valuation.\n\n\u201cA premium valuation is justified, but we believe the premium is now excessive,\u201d analyst Paul Coster said in a note to clients.\n\nCoster believes that the company\u2019s fundamentals are solid and that it is well-positioned for the economic downturn owing to its exposure to diverse U.S. defense and homeland security programs.\n\nHe, however, said the company may have to invest more in sales and marketing to grow its surveillance solutions product business.\n\n\u201cUntil there\u2019s demonstrable pay-off from this investment, and a cyclical tailwind, we are reluctant to chase the valuation multiple up,\u201d he added.\n\nThe brokerage, which cut its price target on the stock by $3 to $56, expects Axsys to underperform the mean of the coverage universe in the near term. Axsys develops high-performance surveillance cameras and imaging systems for the aerospace and defense industries.\n\nShares of Axsys were down nearly 13 percent at $58.50 in morning trade on Nasdaq. They had touched a low of $57.76 earlier in the day and were among the biggest percentage losers. (Reporting by Mary Meyase in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D\u2018Silva)",
