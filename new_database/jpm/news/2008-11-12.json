        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday U.S. unemployment could rise to as much as 7.5 percent and it is already hurting consumer loans as well as the housing market.\n\nJPMorgan, which bought Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual\u2019s banking units in September, is highly exposed to consumer credit and, speaking at Merrill Lynch & Co\u2019s Financial Services Investor Conference, Dimon said losses across the bank\u2019s mortgage and credit card portfolios are rising.\n\nDimon said commercial banks like JPMorgan are seeing the effects of a slowing economy in rising loan losses.\n\nU.S. unemployment rose 0.4 percent to 6.5 percent in October, the highest in 14 years.\n\n\u201cI find it hard to think of why (unemployment) is not going to go at least to 7 percent or 7.5 percent,\u201d he said, noting it is affecting both the bank\u2019s secured and unsecured loans as well as mortgages.\n\nAny area that has seen housing prices fall sharply -- such as Florida, Arizona and California -- is also experiencing higher losses in auto loans and credit cards, he said.\n\nDimon said he is optimistic that steps by the U.S. government to improve the economy, such as investing in banks and encouraging them to lend, will work.\n\n\u201cGovernment actions will be very helpful over time,\u201d he said.",
