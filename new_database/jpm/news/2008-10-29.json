Morgan Securities downgraded Johnson & Johnson Inc\u2019s (JNJ.N) stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d, on valuation and concerns that the drug maker will be hard pressed to grow earnings in 2009 as several of its most profitable drugs are in the process of becoming generic.\n\nThe brokerage expects the company\u2019s pharma business to fall 8 percent to 9 percent in the fourth quarter, and 9 percent to 10 percent in 2009.\n\nBeyond 2009, the brokerage expects J&J\u2019s growth to reaccelerate based on its bullishness on several products in J&J\u2019s pipeline and sees sales growth of 1.8 percent in 2010 and 5.3 percent in 2011 for the pharma business.\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson closed at $64.19 Tuesday on Nasdaq.
