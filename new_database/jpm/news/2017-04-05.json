        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors raised their bearish bets on longer-dated U.S. Treasuries as a rally in the bond market pushed benchmark yields to their lowest since February, J.P. Morgan\u2019s latest Treasury client survey showed on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors had shifted money into Treasuries from stocks and other risky assets in recent weeks on concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump and top Republican lawmakers may struggle to pass fiscal stimulus policies.\n\nFollowing the Republicans\u2019 failure to repeal Obamacare in the House of Representatives, investors have worried the setback could hamper efforts for a broad restructuring of the tax code, including cuts to the rates paid by corporations.\n\nThe anticipated tax cuts had underpinned the surge in bond yields and stock prices following Trump\u2019s win in the Nov. 8 presidential election.\n\nSome analysts said the bond market rally may be overdone.\n\nThe share of \u201cshort\u201d investors who said they were holding fewer longer-dated U.S. government securities than their portfolio benchmarks rose to 23 percent in the week to April 3 from 20 percent in the prior week, J.P. Morgan\u2019s survey showed.\n\nThe share of \u201clong\u201d investors who said they were holding more longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks remained at 16 percent for a second week.\n\nShort investors outnumbered long investors by 7 percentage points, the most in five weeks. A week ago, they were net shorts by four points.\n\nOn Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury US10YT=RR hit a session low of 2.314 percent, its least since Feb. 24, according to Reuters data.\n\nThe share of \u201cneutral\u201d investors who said they were holding amounts of longer-dated Treasuries that match their benchmarks declined to 61 percent from 64 percent last week, the survey showed.\n\nActive clients, which included market makers and hedge funds, stuck to their positions from a week ago, the J.P. Morgan survey showed.\n\nEighty percent of them said they were neutral. None of them said they were short, while 20 percent of them said they were long.",

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon devoted one-third of his annual shareholder letter to arguments for changing regulations, particularly those on bank capital and liquidity, as well as home mortgage loan financing.\n\nCurrent regulations are inconsistent and have left banks with \u201ctoo much capital,\u201d some of which could be used to \u201cfinance the economy without sacrificing safety,\u201d Dimon said in the 17,349-word letter released on Tuesday.\n\nHe also warned that anti-trade policies could be disruptive and geopolitical risks are in a \u201cheightened state.\u201d\n\nDimon, 61, has entered his twelfth year as CEO. He considers the annual letter to be among his most important public statements about JPMorgan, as well as public policy. It is widely read because the bank is one of the most profitable and came out of the financial crisis stronger than competitors.\n\nThis year, Dimon argued that the idea of banks being \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and therefore requiring bailouts during times of stress, is a problem that \u201chas been solved.\u201d He said \u201ctaxpayers will not pay if a bank fails\u201d because of measures enacted since the crisis nearly a decade ago.\n\nDimon\u2019s comments on bank regulation come at a time of possible flux in rules and laws under a new White House and Congress.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve governor who has been overseeing regulation, including bank capital stress tests, is leaving his post on Wednesday and a replacement has yet to be proposed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe way the Fed conducts stress tests should be clearer and more consistent, Dimon said. He also said home mortgage rules imposed since the crisis have raised costs for consumers and made it less likely that those with weak credit histories will get loans.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the rules are beneficial, many were hastily developed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDimon said the geopolitical risk environment is in a \u201cheightened state\u201d with the United Kingdom\u2019s pending withdrawal from the European Union and a growing anti-globalization sentiment.\n\nHe said he hopes Britain\u2019s exit will prompt the EU to fix issues it has with immigration, bureaucracy and restrictive labor laws. \u201cOur fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart,\u201d which, he wrote, \u201ccould have devastating economic and political effects.\u201d\n\nDimon also warned that \u201cpoorly conceived\u201d trade policies could be very disruptive, especially with regard to two key trading partners, Mexico and China.",
