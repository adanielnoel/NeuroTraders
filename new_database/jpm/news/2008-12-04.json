        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge on Thursday dismissed a $2.5 billion lawsuit that challenged JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s (JPM.N) purchase of Bear Stearns Cos, concluding that company officials acted appropriately in avoiding a \u201cpotentially cataclysmic\u201d bankruptcy.\n\nJustice Herman Cahn of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected claims by former Bear shareholders that the company\u2019s directors acted in bad faith in agreeing to a $10-per-share buyout, rather than holding out for a higher price.\n\nThe judge also found in the consolidated class-action case that the plaintiffs failed to show that JPMorgan conspired with Bear\u2019s board, or \u201cdominated\u201d Bear\u2019s daily operations to such a degree that the merger became a foregone conclusion.\n\nBear\u2019s board tried \u201cto preserve some shareholder value while averting the uncertainty of a bankruptcy -- an event with potentially cataclysmic consequences for the broader economy as well as for shareholders,\u201d Cahn wrote in a 44-page ruling.\n\nThe judge said the fallout from letting Bear fail, and perhaps liquidate, \u201cjustified the inclusion of various merger protection provisions intended to increase the certainty of the consummation of the transaction with JPMorgan.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately return calls seeking comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment.\n\nBear was forced to sell itself in a buyout arranged by the U.S. Federal Reserve after fleeing clients led to a liquidity crunch that drove the 85-year-old investment bank to the brink of failure.\n\nJPMorgan originally agreed on March 16 to pay just $2 per share for Bear, but quintupled the price a week later after Bear shareholders objected. It was also allowed to take an immediate 39.5 percent stake in Bear, making it virtually impossible for unhappy shareholders to mount opposition.\n\nThe roughly $1.5 billion buyout closed on May 30, and the Fed agreed to backstop $29 billion in potential losses on Bear\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nCahn separately rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that Jamie Dimon abused his dual role as JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive and as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connection with the buyout talks.\n\n\u201cDimon\u2019s alleged control (or even \u2018domination\u2019) of the negotiations is irrelevant to JPMorgan\u2019s aiding and abetting liability because the only pertinent inquiry is whether the independence of Bear Stearns\u2019 board was compromised,\u201d the judge wrote.",

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shareholder lawsuit against the merger of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and the crippled investment bank Bear Stearns Cos was dismissed on Thursday.\n\nThe lawsuit sought damages from JPMorgan and former directors of Bear Stearns, and asked that the federally arranged merger be set aside.\n\nBut Justice Herman Cahn of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that the Bear directors acted in good faith in agreeing to a $10-per-share takeover. He found that their efforts to \u201cpreserve some shareholder value while averting the uncertainty of a bankruptcy\u201d were warranted.\n\nIn a 44-page ruling, the justice also found that the plaintiffs in the class-action case failed to show that JPMorgan conspired with Bear\u2019s board or otherwise \u201cdominated Bear Stearns\u2019 daily operations\u201d to such a degree that the merger became a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe plaintiffs included former Bear shareholders who contended that the $10-per-share takeover price was too low.\n\nA lawyer for the plaintiffs and a JPMorgan representative did not immediately return calls seeking comment.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of many spurred by the demise of Bear Stearns earlier this year.\n\nThe merger was arranged by the Federal Reserve, which agreed to backstop $29 billion of losses that JPMorgan could incur from taking on Bear\u2019s balance sheet. JPMorgan completed the purchase on May 30.",
