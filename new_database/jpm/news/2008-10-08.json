Morgan Securities upgraded Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS.O) to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cunderweight,\u201d saying the software company\u2019s scheduled restructuring and its contract renewals in 2009 and 2011 make it an investment choice.\n\n\u201cBy no means is this an easy call,\u201d analyst Sterling Auty said in a note to clients. \u201cThere will be several bumps along the way as management has to reinvigorate a lagging product portfolio, meet new competition in its analog strong hold, restructure its workforce and combat sluggish demand for EDA.\u201d\n\nThis could put Cadence into three- to four-year transition that would take its margin expansion up to 21 percent in 2012 from zero percent this year, the analyst added.\n\nThe electronic design automation (EDA) software sector will get healthier in 2009 and should lag the impact of the semiconductor industry, which is expected to get worse before better in 2009, Auty said.\n\nAuty said the company\u2019s shares look attractive on both a free cash flow multiple and a discounted free cash flow basis.\n\nShares of the company closed at $5.16 Tuesday on Nasdaq.
