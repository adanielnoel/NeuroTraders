Credit Suisse agreed to pay $536 million in December 2009 in a case. Barclays Bank in August 2008 settled another Treasury case with the payment of $298 million to the U.S. Department of Justice and the New York County District Attorney\u2019s office.\n\nAmong the subjects of the allegations against JPMorgan were 1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million by Cubans. Another U.S. bank alerted JPMorgan to be suspicious of the transfers, and JPMorgan officials confirmed that Cuba was involved. But the bank did not take steps to stop additional transactions and it did not voluntarily disclose dealings to the government, the department said.\n\nAnother case involved a $2.9 million trade loan involving a vessel affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. Bank managers determined the transaction likely violated the law, but were allegedly slow reporting it to the government and in responding to a subpoena from investigators.
