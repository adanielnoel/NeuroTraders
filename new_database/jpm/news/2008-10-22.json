        "body": "WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - A top U.S. lawmaker is probing whether a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official gave information to a JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) executive about SEC investigations into Bear Stearns.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, citing \u201canonymous but specific\u201d information about what he called inappropriate contact between the SEC\u2019s enforcement director and JPMorgan\u2019s general counsel while the investment bank was mulling a bid for Bear Stearns.\n\nThe SEC \u201cenforcement director gave information to the (General Counsel) of JPMorgan Chase (himself a former SEC enforcement director) about the state of various investigations into Bear,\u201d Grassley wrote in his letter dated Oct. 21, citing the anonymous information.\n\nLinda Thomsen is the SEC\u2019s enforcement director, while former SEC enforcement director Stephen Cutler is general counsel at JPMorgan.\n\nIn March, the Federal Reserve backed JPMorgan\u2019s firesale purchase of ailing investment bank Bear Stearns for $2 a share, after Bear had previously traded at $30.85 per share. JPMorgan later agreed to raise the price to about $10 a share.\n\n\u201cThis inside information, gotten through a personal relationship, would be critical in helping Morgan put together a low-ball bid to Bear and the US government,\u201d Grassley\u2019s letter continued, citing his anonymous tip. \u201cThis could have materially affected the amount of guarantees that Morgan was able to negotiate from the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\nAn SEC spokesman declined to comment on Grassley\u2019s letter. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn March, SEC staff declined, in a publicly released letter, to assure JPMorgan that there would be no future enforcement actions regarding Bear Stearns\u2019 statements ahead of their merger announcement.\n\nThe SEC has been hammered in recent weeks by reports of improprieties in its enforcement division. The SEC\u2019s inspector general found earlier this month that an SEC regional director failed to vigorously enforce securities laws in a 2003 investigation into Bear Stearns\u2019 pricing of collateralized debt obligations.\n\nThe inspector general found in a separate report in October that the SEC should discipline Thomsen and two supervisors for their role in an insider trading probe.\n\nAnd in another inspector general report in September, the internal watchdog said the SEC failed to adequately supervise Bear Stearns and limit the amount of risk it took on.
