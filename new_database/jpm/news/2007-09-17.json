Morgan Securities upgraded Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cunderweight,\u201d saying the company\u2019s new server chip, Barcelona, closes its performance gap with Intel Corp\u2019s (INTC.O) server products.\n\nThe brokerage said it expects the chip maker to launch a faster chip by the end of December, which could outperform Intel\u2019s Penryn.\n\nJ.P. Morgan however said although AMD\u2019s margins should improve, it believes the company will continue to lose money because Intel has superior products and cost structure.
