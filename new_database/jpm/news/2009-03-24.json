        "body": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said it has hired JPMorgan (JPM.N) banker Joseph Jiampietro to advise on complex financial transactions, as the regulator braces to run more auctions to sell bad bank assets.\n\nJiampietro helped financial institutions buy and sell assets at JPMorgan.\n\nHe joins the FDIC as it prepares to facilitate one of the biggest asset transfers in history.\n\nThe United States said on Monday that the government would help otherwise healthy banks sell off hundreds of billions of dollars of bad assets, through auctions and by providing financing to prospective buyers.\n\n\u201cI believe that the FDIC will benefit greatly from Mr. Jiampietro\u2019s extensive markets and transactional expertise as the Corporation assumes broader responsibilities in significant and complex financial programs,\u201d FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said in a statement.\n\nThe FDIC also is widely expected to seize billions more of assets from troubled banks and sell them or give them to healthier institutions.\n\nJiampietro moved from UBS to JPMorgan in 2007. Before he worked at the Swiss bank, he was a corporate lawyer and he also served as legal counsel with the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.
