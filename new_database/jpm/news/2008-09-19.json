        "body": "NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market will be damaged for an extended period after Lehman Brothers\u2019 LEH.N LEHMQ.PK bondholders suffered a more than $90 billion loss from the investment bank\u2019s default, JPMorgan said in a report on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings on Monday, Sept. 15, was a devastating loss for high-grade investors,\u201d JPMorgan said. Lehman had about $110 billion of long-term debt on its balance sheet that is now trading on average in the mid-teens dollar price, JPMorgan said.\n\nInvestment-grade bond spreads, or their yields relative to U.S. Treasuries, surged this week to record highs as significant default risk was priced into several other financial companies after Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, JPMorgan said.\n\nStill, spreads are not high enough to attract investors, the bank said.\n\nLehman\u2019s default also caused a 1.6 percent drop in high-grade corporate bond investment returns, leaving the market with a 4.6 percent year-to-date loss, exactly offsetting last year\u2019s gains, JPMorgan said.

        "body": "NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities said on Friday the actions taken by the U.S. government aimed at stemming systemic risk have created a bottom in prices for cash and derivative segments of the asset-backed securities market.\n\n\u201cThe actions taken this week and those that are forthcoming make it extremely likely that we have seen the bottom in ABS, ABX and non-agency MBS prices,\u201d said Chris Flanagan, analyst at JPMorgan Securities. \u201cEven after Friday morning\u2019s sharp rally, we still see extraordinary value and move to overweight,\u201d the analyst said in a report.\n\nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Friday called for the U.S. government to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to take so-called toxic mortgage assets off the books of financial firms to restore financial stability.\n\nThe surprise move comes as the Treasury and Federal Reserve consider broad government intervention to prevent the collapse of the financial system, shaken in recent days by a crisis at insurer American International Group (AIG.N) that required a $85 billion government rescue and the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK. For details, see [ID:nLJ642958]\n\n\u201cWhat the RTC-type response along with the other policy moves does is address -- and put a floor on -- the capital inadequacy issue for the banking system, which had been deteriorating rapidly as the events of this week were transpiring,\u201d said Flanagan.\n\n\u201cWith good policy now in place, we look to expand risk taking and look for returns in the lowest priced, longest duration risk in ABX,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nFlanagan also said top slices of subprime mortgage indexes including, the ABX 07-1 and ABX 07-2 \u201cPENAAA\u201d and \u201cAAA\u201d segments as well as the \u201cAA\u201d layer of the ABX 06-1 index, offer the best value.\n\nIn consumer ABS, top-tier credit card and auto ABS issues offer the best value, the analyst said, and recommended investors rotate out of FFELP student loans.
