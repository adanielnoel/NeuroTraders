        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street\u2019s wealth management firms scramble to comply with a new U.S. Department of Labor rule, JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Wednesday it will stop offering commissions-paying retirement accounts.\n\nIn doing so, J.P. Morgan will join Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch and other firms that recently adopted the approach.\n\nThe so-called fiduciary rule, which takes effect in April, is aimed at forcing brokerages to put their clients\u2019 interests first by eliminating any conflict of interest created by brokers\u2019 commissions.\n\nThe rule targets \u201ctransactional\u201d accounts, which charge clients a commission for every trade, and rather than wade through the complexities of the 1,000-plus page regulation, many firms are just dropping transactional retirement accounts altogether.\n\nStarting in April, clients of Chase Wealth Management, Private Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities have two options: they can either chose to pay a financial adviser a flat fee based on how much money they have invested, or they can use an online platform to manage their retirement account themselves.\n\n\u201cWe believe this reflects how our clients are doing business today,\u201d said Barry Sommers, chief executive of the bank\u2019s wealth management business.\n\nMerrill Lynch and Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent brokerage with 7,000 advisers, both announced similar plans last month.\n\nThe move will only affect a sliver of J.P. Morgan\u2019s wealth management clients, which range from mass affluent to ultra high net worth.\n\nJust 5 percent of the $1.1 trillion in client assets managed at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management & Investment Solutions are held in retirement accounts, and only those in commissions-paying accounts will be impacted by the change.",
