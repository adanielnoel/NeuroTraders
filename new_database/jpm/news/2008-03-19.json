        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon\u2019s grab of Bear Stearns may turn into one of the biggest bargains in recent years.\n\nBanking experts were almost unanimous in their appraisal of the move by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which is run by Dimon, to buy Wall Street rival Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that this represents a great bargain for JPMorgan,\u201d said Samuel Hayes, emeritus professor of finance at Harvard Business School.\n\n\u201cBear Stearns was, until this year, one of the smartest and most profitable investment banks in the world,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cThis could be a real money-spinner for JPMorgan.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan agreed on Sunday to buy Bear Stearns, which was slammed by a sudden cash crunch, for about $2 a share -- about 90 percent below its Friday close. The all-stock deal values the company, recently ranked as the No. 5 U.S. investment bank, at about $236 million.\n\nBrad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, estimated that a breakup of Bear Stearns would fetch $7.7 billion. \u201cThis is a tremendous bargain for JPMorgan shareholders,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nThe deal will cost JPMorgan more than just stock. The bank is setting aside $6 billion to cover deal-related costs such as litigation and severance, putting the total cost much higher.\n\n\u201cEven with an estimated $6 billion of transaction costs, the deal economics look very compelling,\u201d said Citibank analyst Keith Horowitz.\n\n\u201cFrom a strategic perspective JPMorgan is getting several business lines from Bear that are very complementary to its investment bank,\u201d Horowitz said in a note to clients.\n\nDimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has developed a reputation as a turnaround specialist since bouncing back from being ousted from Citigroup Inc (C.N) a decade ago.\n\nHe\u2019ll need those skills to integrate cash-strapped Bear Stearns into JPMorgan\u2019s financial empire, which includes car loans, credit cards, and investment banking.\n\n\u201cDimon negotiated well,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a note, but added that the deal \u201cdoes not come without risk.\u201d\n\nInvestors cheered Dimon\u2019s move, boosting JPMorgan\u2019s stock as much as 12.5 percent despite a broader sell-off in the financial sector. The Standard & Poor\u2019s financials index .GSPF fell 1.4 percent, marking its lowest level in almost five years.\n\nThe deal, which includes $30 billion in special Federal Reserve financing for Bear Stearns\u2019 less liquid assets, followed an emergency funding package on Friday for Bear Stearns by JPMorgan through the Federal Reserve after its liquidity deteriorated significantly.\n\nSome saw the quick deal turnaround as a reason for caution. \u201cThe issue is what is Bear Stearns really worth,\u201d said Jim Huguet, chief executive of Great Companies LLC, a Tampa, Florida, investment adviser. \u201cI\u2018m not sure you can answer that in two or three days.\u201d\n\nBut Dimon has a good track record fixing up major banks. After being ousted from Citibank a decade ago, he became CEO of Bank One in 2000, fixing it up and eventually selling the bank to JPMorgan in 2004.\n\nHe has kept JPMorgan, which posted a 6 percent rise in 2007 net profit, largely unscarred by the credit crisis ravaging the financial sector.\n\nJPMorgan, the No. 2 U.S. bank by market value, expects the acquisition, which includes Bear Stearns\u2019 profitable clearing and prime brokerage businesses, to add $1 billion to earnings once it is fully integrated.\n\nJPMorgan shares closed up $3.77, or 10.3 percent, at $40.31 on the New York Stock Exchange, where they traded as high as $41.09 during Monday\u2019s session. Bear Stearns shares closed at $4.81, down 84 percent.",

It now expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to fall 1.4 percent, versus its previous view of flat EBITDA growth.\n\nShares of Lamar closed at $34.80 Tuesday on Nasdaq.
