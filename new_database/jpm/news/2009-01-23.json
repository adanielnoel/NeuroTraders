Morgan Securities resumed coverage of CME Group Inc (CME.O) with an \u201cunderweight\u201d rating and a $145 price target, saying CME\u2019s volumes could be under material pressure in 2009 due to very low interest rates and deleveraging.\n\n\u201cWith dealers, hedge funds, and mutual funds all under significant pressure from asset declines, and algorithmic traders likely under pressure from falling volumes, we see potential for volume declines to be worse in this cycle than experienced in previous cycles,\u201d the brokerage said.\n\nJP Morgan, which previously rated the derivatives exchange \u201coverweight,\u201d said the outlook for 2010 was also uncertain as, according to historical data, multi-year volume slowdowns were not unique.\n\nGiven weak volumes in the fourth quarter and a poor start to trading volumes in 2009, JP Morgan said it expected the analyst community to reduce estimates materially, putting CME\u2019s stock under additional pressure.\n\nOn Thursday, Sanford C.

        "body": "BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan on Friday cut its 2009 earnings forecast and price targets for China\u2019s top Internet search firms Baidu.com Inc (BIDU.O), SINA Corp (SINA.O) and Sohu.com Inc (SOHU.O), citing slowing economic growth and advertising revenue.\n\nJ.P. Morgan had earlier lowered its forecast for China\u2019s economic growth this year to 7.2 percent and said the country\u2019s advertising market growth would be flat in 2009, after an earlier projection of 5 percent growth.\n\nThe lowered outlook comes a day after China said its economy grew 9.0 percent last year, the slowest pace in seven years.\n\nThe U.S. bank revised down its December 2009 share price target for Baidu to $190, from $300. Baidu shares closed at $112.53 on Thursday on the Nasdaq exchange.\n\nBaidu\u2019s 2008 fourth quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) forecast was cut 6.3 percent to $1.19, and the diluted EPS forecast for the first quarter of this year by 19.1 percent to $0.93, said the bank.\n\nThe target price for Internet media firm SINA was cut to $29, from an earlier $53 target, while the target for Sohu was dropped to $62, from $100.\n\nThe shares of the two companies closed Thursday at $20.59 and $39.47, respectively.\n\nSINA\u2019s first quarter EPS was cut 5.7 percent to $0.33, while the firm\u2019s 2009 EPS was raised to 6.5 percent to $1.96.\n\nSohu\u2019s first quarter EPS target was cut 6.4 percent to $1.02, while the full 2009 forecast was lowered 6.9 percent to $4.45.\n\nWhile the bank warned that near-term economic data would be weak, it also said there could be buying opportunities for investors in the three companies after the first quarter.\n\nJ.P. Morgan expects Baidu.com\u2019s revenue to fall 11.7 percent in the first quarter of 2009 from the previous quarter to $116.5 million due to the slowing economy, but it maintained a positive view of the company down the road.\n\nBaidu continues to improve its technology and expand its potential to raise revenues, and the firm leads the country\u2019s fast growing search market, the bank said in a report.\n\nThe bank was optimistic about Sina\u2019s prospects due to long-term online ad growth potential and its media role, but the firm\u2019s recent acquisition of Focus Media Ltd\u2019s FMCN.O core assets increased risk and uncertainty for the company.\n\nJ.P. Morgan maintained an overweight rating on Sohu due to online advertising, but it said a slowing economy and delays in launching online games posed risks.
