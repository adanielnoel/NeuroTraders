        "body": "SYDNEY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - JP Morgan has forecast 2008 thermal coal contract prices between Australian miners and Japanese utilities will jump by over 60 percent, citing Indian coal demand and global infrastructure constraints.\n\nJP Morgan raised its contract price forecast to $90 a tonne, a 61.7 percent increase from last year\u2019s agreed price of $55.65 and a 28.5 percent increase from its earlier forecast of $70.\n\n\u201cGiven the strong growth in demand for seaborne coal with limited new supply, we see overall strength for the international coal market,\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s commodities analyst David George said in a research report issued on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is the growing demand for imported coal into India that could have the greatest impact on the industry,\u201d George said.\n\nGeorge said India\u2019s plans to bring on 40-50 gigawatts of thermal coal capacity, to add to the existing 60 gigawatts of generation, could result in additional imports of about 80 million tonnes per year.\n\nHe added that a developing drought in China could reduce the country\u2019s hydro power generation and raise its coal import demand in 2008.\n\nSupply growth was expected to remain muted as rising domestic demand in Indonesia and Vietnam could reduce their exports, but some replacement tonnage could be sought from Kazakhstan, the bank said.\n\nJP Morgan also raised its forecast for 2008 coking coal prices to $140 a tonne, a 42 percent jump from last year\u2019s agreed price of $98.38. Its previous estimate was $120 a tonne.\n\nAustralia is the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of coal, exporting 257 million tonnes in 2007, mostly from mines operated by Xstrata Plc XTA.L, BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP.AX) and Rio Tinto Ltd (RIO.AX).\n\nSevere congestion at Australia\u2019s Newcastle and Dalrymple Bay coal ports, combined with port problems in Russia and South Africa, have helped push spot thermal coal prices to double in 2007 to about $90 a tonne.\n\nNews of China suspending coal exports, severe power shortages in South Africa and force majeure declarations by some Australian miners after heavy rain last week have also sent spot coal prices soaring to a record high of $102.75 a tonne, data from electronic platform globalCOAL showed on Wednesday.\n\nJP Morgan is forecasting 2009 thermal coal contract prices at $80 a tonne and coking coal prices at $120 a tonne.
