Morgan Securities downgraded Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), the largest U.S. online travel agency, to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d and said increased competition and pricing wars would cut into revenue and limit market share gains.\n\nAnalyst Imran Khan said the company\u2019s recent decision to waive booking fees on all flights booked through May 31 is likely to become a permanent change, and expects it to result in a $90 million decline in revenue in 2009.\n\nKhan, who cut his price target on the stock to $9 from $12, said no booking fees for air tickets have become somewhat the industry norm.\n\n\u201cWe now find it unlikely that this program will result in market share gains to offset this decline,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nProgress in international markets has also not been seen, the analyst said.\n\n\u201cDespite significant investment in increasing international hotel inventory and the acquisition of Venere, we have not seen any increase in market share in Europe,\u201d Khan said.\n\nExpedia agreed to buy Venere, an online travel agency focusing on hotel reservations, in July last year.\n\nShares of Expedia, which have lost 62 percent of their value in the last year, were trading down 7 percent at $7.56 Thursday morning on Nasdaq.
