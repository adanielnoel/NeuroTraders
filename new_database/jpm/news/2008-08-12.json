        "body": "LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - European shares ended with losses on Tuesday as the region\u2019s financial stocks suffered following further writedowns from U.S. peer JPMorgan (JPM.N).\n\nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of top European shares provisionally closed 0.4 percent lower at 1,208.58, having traded between 1,202.55 and 1,216.40 points.\n\nJPMorgan (JPM.N), the third-largest bank in the United States, traded 6.2 percent lower on Wall Street after saying it had taken another $1.5 billion in writedowns in the current quarter as wider credit spreads, lower levels of liquidity and further disruption in the credit and mortgage markets took a toll.\n\nThe DJ Stoxx European banks .SX7P fell 1.1 percent with BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Deustche Postbank DPBGn.DE and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) all down more than 3 percent. Natixis (CNAT.PA) lost 9.7 percent.\n\n\u201cThe market is doubting whether the U.S. rate cuts are having an effect,\u201d said strategist Andreas Huerkamp at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. had a steep yield curve since January, which usually has a positive effect on the equity markets, but now 7 months have passed and we are still experiencing negative news in the financial sector,\u201d he added.\n\nUBS ended 2.4 percent lower after a rollercoaster session, which saw the stock gaining as much as 4.2 percent and falling as much as 2.9 percent.\n\nThe Swiss bank announced new management as well as a split of its business into three units. While the group missed consensus estimates with its quarterly results, analysts praised its improved Tier 1 ratio as well as its focus on reducing its exposure to risky asset classes.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said it has racked up $1.5 billion of losses so far this quarter on mortgage-linked assets, reflecting deepening turmoil in credit markets.\n\nShares of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets fell 9.5 percent, as investors grew increasingly disappointed with a bank that had largely sidestepped the worst of the credit crunch, and analysts cut their profit estimates.\n\nChief Executive Jamie Dimon has kept JPMorgan profitable even as rivals such as Citigroup Inc and Merrill Lynch & Co posted a series of multi-billion dollar quarterly losses.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a huge global trading house, it\u2019s very hard to hide from the devastation,\u201d said Steve Persky, chief executive at Dalton Investments in Los Angeles.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s shares fell as the broader financial sector dropped. Lehman Brothers fell 12 percent to $16.21, while Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs all fell more than 6 percent.\n\nJPMorgan revealed the losses in a regulatory filing late Monday. The bank said trading conditions have \u201csubstantially deteriorated\u201d in the third quarter, and mortgage-backed securities and loans have weakened.\n\nThe New York-based bank also has substantial exposure to credit cards and other consumer debt that looks increasingly vulnerable as the U.S. economy grows slowly.\n\nThe Financial Times said JPMorgan was under pressure to write down mortgage assets, in part because of Merrill\u2019s decision to sell $30.6 billion of repackaged debt to a private equity fund at 22 cents on the dollar.\n\nAs of June 30, JPMorgan held $19.5 billion of prime and Alt-A mortgage exposure, $1.9 billion of subprime mortgage exposure, and $11.6 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) exposure, the filing showed.\n\n\u201cThese mortgage exposures could be adversely affected by worsening market conditions, further deterioration in the housing market and market activity reflecting distressed sellers,\u201d JPMorgan said. Loss estimates exclude hedging, it said.\n\nTrading results could also be hit if the bank\u2019s own debt became more valuable. That could theoretically make it more expensive to buy back its own debt, resulting in an accounting charge.\n\nAnalyst Richard Bove at Ladenburg Thalmann argued that JPMorgan\u2019s difficulties raised questions about the reason for the bank\u2019s current mix of businesses.\n\nJPMorgan, formed through a series of acquisitions over the last decade, was supposed to have consumer banking and capital markets businesses that complemented each other: when one was doing poorly, the other was supposed to be doing well.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the first time this concept was tested, it did not work. Both (businesses) seem to be declining in tandem with each other,\u201d Bove wrote in a note to clients. Bove cut his estimates for the bank\u2019s earnings for 2008 through 2010.\n\nJPMorgan shares fell $3.97, or 9.5 percent, to $37.92 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nLast month, JPMorgan posted a smaller-than-expected 53 percent decline in quarterly earnings on resilient stock and bond underwriting revenue but cautioned that the mortgage market and the economy were getting worse.\n\nIn the filing, JPMorgan said that it expected continued credit deterioration in its consumer portfolio, requiring more reserves for losses, during the rest of 2008.\n\nIt also said home equity charge-offs could keep rising this year, while prime and subprime mortgage net charge-offs would likely rise \u201csignificantly.\u201d It said further mortgage deterioration was likely into 2009.\n\nJPMorgan held $16.3 billion of unplaced loans funding buyouts and unfunded commitments for loans as of June 30, the filing said.\n\n\u201cLeveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult to hedge effectively, and if market conditions further deteriorate, additional markdowns may be necessary,\u201d it said.\n\nLehman Brothers Inc analysts on Tuesday cut their 2008 profit forecast for JPMorgan to $2.30 a share from $2.60, but kept an \u201coverweight\u201d rating and $50 share price target.",
