        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - It could take Citigroup (C.N) nearly three years to recoup losses on any further substantial write-downs of its collateralized debt obligations, a scenario analysts at CreditSights Inc. say could spark a takeover by smaller rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N).\n\n\u201cThe prospect of having to stomach Draconian marks against outsized CDO and SIV exposure could put Citi in a precarious position in terms of capital levels,\u201d CreditSights, an independent fixed-income research firm, said in its analysis.\n\nAs a result, Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank by assets, could have to consider a dividend cut, a major asset sale or even a takeover by a stronger bank, CreditSights said.\n\nJPMorgan is seen as potential acquirer because its management team, led by CEO Jamie Dimon, has worked at Citi. Dimon also is seen as someone who could combine the two banks for big cost savings, CreditSights said.\n\nA 15 percent reduction in operating expenses could increase profit by more than $6 billion, CreditSights said.\n\nJPMorgan declined comment. Citigroup was not immediately available for comment.\n\nSuch a takeover would be huge, approaching a $200 billion price tag. Citigroup\u2019s current market capitalization is about $172 billion.\n\n\u201cFollowing the ouster of CEO Charles Prince, Citi is yet to unveil a new CEO,\u201d CreditSights said. \u201cOne of the options would be to sell the company to JPMorgan.\u201d\n\nCitigroup\u2019s board meets this week. A new CEO could be announced. Frontrunners include Citi executive Vikram Pandit, who oversees trading, investment banking and alternative investing, and former Citigroup President Robert Willumstad.\n\nEstimates by CreditSights said it would take Citigroup 2.7 years to earn back the money lost on a 25 percent write-down on its CDO exposure of about $46 billion.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s potential problems become even more worrisome when you consider its roughly $66 billion exposure to SIVs.\n\n\u201cOne key question is whether Citi can continue to support its SIVs by purchasing their short term obligations without demonstrating recourse that could require the company to bring the assets on its balance sheet,\u201d CreditSights analysts said in their report.",

        "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) expects the current market turmoil to unleash a wave of bank mergers in the U.S. and Germany, JP Morgan Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a German newspaper on Friday.\n\n\u201cI believe that we will see a huge amount of big mergers in the U.S. and Germany,\u201d Dimon told business daily Boersen-Zeitung.\n\n\u201cCompanies recognize after such a collapse that they need more weight, more capital and access to good, long-term financing and the people there say to themselves: \u2018Now it is time to do something\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat normally comes after the crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cDuring the crisis, they are very busy.\u201d\n\nHe said the industry faced a difficult fourth quarter, adding he was seeing higher losses in the area of consumer credit.\n\nDimon added it would not bother him if the planned super-SIV (structured investment vehicle) in the U.S. was not set up.\n\n\u201cFor JPMorgan, in any event, it is no big deal if the SIV comes or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not call it a failure if the SIV did not happen. I would say, it did not happen but it would not worry me, no. I think it is OK to try something like that if you think it helps.\u201d",

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the third-largest U.S. bank, avoided most of the losses suffered by other investment banks and its growth could now \u201creally accelerate,\u201d weekly financial publication Barron\u2019s reported on Sunday.\n\nThe paper cited Chief Executive Jamie Dimon\u2019s \u201cfirm hand\u201d as the reason why JPMorgan had escaped the worst of the problems caused by subprime lending. Barron\u2019s said the risk-conscious CEO had sold most of its subprime loans originated in 2006 and early 2007, which are regarded as the most problematic.\n\nCiting analysts, the publication said that JPMorgan\u2019s stock could be undervalued. It said the consolidation resulting from the merger of JPMorgan with Bank One, which took place in 2004, was now nearly completed, and had resulted in about $3 billion in cost savings.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan did have to take a write-down of $1.3 billion on leveraged loans in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, we weren\u2019t disciplined enough in leveraged finance in turning down deals when terms became too loose,\u201d Dimon wrote after the quarter, according to Barron\u2018s. \u201cWe\u2019ve since tightened our standards.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan, one of the 30 stocks that make up the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, closed on Friday at $46.08, down 13 cents, or 0.3 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.",
