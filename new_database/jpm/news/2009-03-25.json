        "body": "NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has sued the bankrupt holding company for Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK in an effort to preserve its purchase of the banking operations of what was once the largest U.S. savings and loan.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Tuesday with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware, three days after Washington Mutual sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp for well over $13 billion in connection with the purchase. With $307 billion of assets, Washington Mutual is by far the largest U.S. lender to fail.\n\nDavid Berz, a lawyer for Washington Mutual, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nThe lawsuits will not undo JPMorgan\u2019s $1.9 billion purchase on Sept. 25 of Washington Mutual\u2019s bank operations, a transaction arranged by the FDIC. But resolution of the suits could be a template for other U.S. bank failures, which analysts believe could reach into the hundreds over the next couple of years.\n\nJPMorgan said it sued to ensure that it does not lose any of its interests in the Washington Mutual operations, which it said it bought in good faith. The New York-based bank also wants to be reimbursed for various claims it might face.\n\n\u201cProtection of the title conveyed by the FDIC to institutions like JPMorgan Chase, who are encouraged to step into the breach and provide the stability and continuity necessary to avert a run on a failing bank and disruption of its services to the public, is critical to the ability of the regulators to manage bank failures,\u201d JPMorgan said in its complaint.\n\nThe bank also said Washington Mutual\u2019s failure came at no cost to the FDIC insurance fund, while the July 2008 failure of IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMCQ.PK, a California thrift one-tenth the size of Washington Mutual, cost the FDIC $10.7 billion.\n\nSeattle-based Washington Mutual failed amid soaring mortgage losses and a bank run where customers withdrew billions of dollars of deposits.\n\nThe holding company believes JPMorgan paid too little for its bank operations and is litigating to recover more money for creditors in its Chapter 11 case. Washington Mutual\u2019s claims concern capital contributions made to the banking unit, trust preferred securities, tax refunds and other matters.\n\nIn morning trading, JPMorgan shares rose $1.89, or 7.2 percent, to $28.11 on the New York Stock Exchange, as U.S. bank shares rallied broadly.\n\nThe JPMorgan case is In re Washington Mutual Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington), No. 08-12229. The earlier Washington Mutual case is Washington Mutual Inc v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 09-00533.

Morgan Securities started coverage of BlackBerry smartphone maker Research in Motion RIM.TORIMM.O with an \u201cunderweight\u201d rating and a price target of $40, saying the company is already operating close to its peak earnings power.\n\nAnalyst Ehud Gelblum said further growth in unit volume would be offset by declines in average selling price and corresponding growth in research and development.\n\n\u201cWhile unit volumes and subscriber numbers should continue to grow, we believe the rate of growth should slow considerably over the next 18 months as we move beyond the recent slew of new model launched,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that consumer replacement cycles were lengthening across the entire handset market due to weak consumer spending, and the rising unemployment was expected to erode Research in Motion\u2019s customer base.\n\nGelblum said currently users were replacing their BlackBerrys every 1.5 years at an unsustainably high replacement rate of 69 percent.\n\nHe expects the replacement rate to fall 43 percent by fiscal 2011, implying a new BlackBerry every 2.3 years. However, analyst Gelblum noted that the company\u2019s high-margin services revenue stream provides strong gross profit and cash flow, helping offset the declining device margins.

        "body": "(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) may have to set aside a significant amount of money to cover more losses in the next few quarters as U.S. credit card defaults are expected to remain high, analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities said, as they reinitiated the stock with an \u201cunderweight\u201d rating.\n\nAnalysts Andrew Wessel and Daniel Kim projected a 45 percent increase in loss-reserve expense for the company in 2009 versus a year ago, and a nearly 6 percent decline in billed business due mainly to a fall in consumer discretionary spending.\n\nJP Morgan analysts expect U.S. consumers to cut down on discretionary spending and build savings until unemployment levels stabilize and the housing market collapse begins to abate.\n\n\u201cGiven this macro view and our 10 percent unemployment outlook, we believe AmEx will face ongoing declines in billed business and significant increases in charge-offs well into 2010,\u201d the analysts wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThey have a price target of $10.50 on the stock. AmEx, the largest U.S. charge card operator by sales volume, said last week that its net charge-off rate -- debts the company believes will never be repaid -- rose to 8.70 percent in February from 8.30 percent in January.\n\n\u201cOur model forecasts peak charge-offs of 11 percent on a managed basis in second quarter of 2010,\u201d the analysts said, adding that they saw further downside risk to their current charge-off estimates.\n\nThe analysts, however, believe AmEx is well-capitalized when compared with peers, and said the company may not need additional equity.\n\nJP Morgan analysts also expect AmEx to remain profitable through the cycle, but said a prolonged recession will restrict material earnings growth until 2011. Shares of the company, which caters to wealthier consumers that are viewed as more credit worthy, closed at $13.90 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.",
