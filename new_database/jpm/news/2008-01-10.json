        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped into the private sector on Thursday, joining U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase and Co Inc (JPM.N) as a senior adviser to its board and clients.\n\nThe bank said Blair, who is working as a Middle East peace envoy for the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States, would advise its chief executive and senior management team on global politics on a part-time basis.\n\nHe would also take part in company events with key clients -- with his name and contact seen by some as a major draw.\n\nBlair biographer Anthony Seldon said there would inevitably be allegations he was selling out, but that ultimately his new job was likely to come second to his global political work.\n\n\u201cMaybe this is a harbinger of a new Tony Blair,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cBut he has never struck me as someone who enjoys particularly the trappings of wealth except foreign holidays with his children.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this will be nearly as important to him as his other priorities such as the inter-faith dialogue work and the Middle East,\u201d he added.\n\nSeldon said Blair had immersed himself in international affairs probably more than any other European politician and was therefore a very high-profile global name for such a job.\n\n\u201cHe is about as good as it gets,\u201d he said, contrasting Blair with the U.S. president whom he said was seen as a less lucrative brand once he leaves office. \u201cMost firms would rather have George W. Bush advising their competition.\u201d\n\nBlair said of his new job with JPMorgan: \u201cI look forward to advising them on how they approach the huge political and economic changes that globalization brings.\u201d\n\nLondon\u2019s Evening Standard newspaper said the role was rumored to be worth 500,000 pounds ($980,000) a year, and contrasted his wealth with the hardship of soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan -- both wars begun under Blair -- who have struggled for compensation.\n\nThe Financial Times, which first reported the move on its Web Site, said the job was the first of a series that Blair -- who stood down last year after a decade in office -- intended to take in the private sector.\n\nBlair is credited with bringing his Labor Party out of years in opposition to win a landslide election in 1997, but his popularity was damaged in Britain by the Iraq war and his staunch support for Bush.\n\n\u201cI have always been interested in commerce and the impact of globalization,\u201d Blair told the Financial Times.\n\nFormer prime ministers have often relied on private sector work or lucrative public speaking fees -- particularly in the United States -- after leaving office, but some analysts were unfazed by Blair\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cWhen I come to look at my earnings estimates for JPMorgan I certainly wouldn\u2019t be making an adjustment for the Tony Blair factor,\u201d said Richard Staite, banking analyst for Atlantic Equities in London. \u201cIt is a pretty marginal issue.\u201d",
