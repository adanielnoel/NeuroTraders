The stock has fallen nearly 20 percent this year, in line with the decline of the KBW Bank Stock index .BKX.\n\nJPMorgan shares have fallen as the outlook for bank profits has dimmed with expectations of continued low interest rates, higher costs for bad loans, particularly related to energy, and a slow economy.\n\nJPMorgan said last month that its tangible book value, which is its net worth, was $48.13 per share at the end of December.\n\nDimon\u2019s purchase on Thursday totaled $26.59 million and brought his total beneficial ownership to 7.79 million shares worth $413 million at Thursday\u2019s closing price. The purchases were made through personal and family accounts, the filing showed.\n\nDimon\u2019s share purchase was reported by the Wall Street Journal before the filing became public.",
