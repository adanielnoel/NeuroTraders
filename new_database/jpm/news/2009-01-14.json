On the ASF website, he predicted registrants would build to 3,000 to 4,000.\n\nSpeakers will include Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, and James Lockhart, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nThe ASF and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association in 2008 launched a number of initiatives to refresh investor confidence, including ways to improve the rating process, increase transparency and better define values of asset-backed securities.\n\n\u201cThe theme of the ASF 2009 conference is building the market of the future,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe current registration and sponsorship lists demonstrate that the event is attracting leaders in global finance, as well as the regulatory and policy-making community.\u201d (Editing by Dan Grebler)",
