        "body": "LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The UK division of insurer Canada Life CL_pb.TO emerged as the institutional investor which sealed a deal to hedge 500 million pound ($901 million) of longevity exposure with JP Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nA JP Morgan spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters on Monday that a deal involving \u201clong dated\u201d longevity swaps had taken place, but did not identify the insurer.\n\n\u201cWhile there are no details available from Canada Life, we can confirm that they are the UK insurer involved in the longevity deal with JP Morgan,\u201d a spokeswoman for Canada Life said on Tuesday.\n\nIn February, JP Morgan signed another deal with insurer Lucida, which specialises in taking on longevity risk and corporate pension schemes.\n\nThe nascent longevity swap market could see a lucrative future as pension schemes, whose assets are valued at above $20 trillion, seek to hedge their longevity exposure -- the risk that people on live longer on average than expected.\n\nA longevity swap helps pension schemes and insurance companies manage the risk of increasing life duration by enlisting a counterparty to pay pensions.\n\nIn return, the scheme pays the counterparty an agreed stream of cash, which is generally an estimate of the future pension payments by the counterparty, based on an assumed future level of improvement in longevity.",

Air France is advised by Lazard and Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Investment. S7 has not picked an advising bank yet.\n\nAustria elected a new parliament on Sunday in which the parties backing the outgoing government lost heavily. However, a reprise of the governing left-right coalition appeared to be likely after conservatives appointed a new leader on Monday.\n\nThere was a broad consensus in the outgoing government, which remains in place in a caretaker capacity until a new one is formed, to go ahead with the sale of Austrian.\n\nAustria\u2019s state holding company OeIAG, which is offering its 43-percent stake, is advised by Merrill Lynch.
