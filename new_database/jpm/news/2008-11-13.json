        "body": "Nov 13 (Reuters) - The inability to earn at par with dividend levels, and regulatory pressure will force more U.S. mid-sized banks to further slash their dividend, J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Steven Alexopoulos said.\n\nU.S. lawmakers had urged Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Wednesday to clarify that the government bailout funds should not be used to acquire healthy banks or pay out dividends.\n\nBanks should not maintain a level of cash dividends inconsistent with the firm\u2019s capital position that could weaken the firm\u2019s financial health, or that could impair its ability to meet the needs of credit-worthy borrowers, regulators said.\n\nAnalyst Alexopoulos said Marshall & Ilsley Corp MI.N, TCF Financial Corp TCB.N, BB&T Corp (BBT.N), Synovus Financial Corp (SNV.N) and M&T Bank Corp (MTB.N) are most likely to be forced by regulators to cut their dividend, although each of them have said they do not need to take such a step.\n\nThe analyst sees least risk of a dividend cut at City National Bank CYN.N, PrivateBancorp Inc PVTB.O, People\u2019s United Financial Inc (PBCT.O) and Zions Bancorp (ZION.O).\n\nU.S. banks like Colonial BancGroup Inc CNB.N, Columbia Bancorp CBBO.O and Cascade Financial Corp CASB.O have been slashing or suspending their dividend in the past months amid a difficult credit market and declining capital levels, as shareholder equity continues to fall.\n\nSo far the Treasury Department has injected $115 billion into the eight largest banks, such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N), in a bid to mend broken credit markets and restore health to the financial system. The government has earmarked a total of $250 billion for banks, including money for smaller, regional ones.\n\nThe $60 billion remaining under the U.S. government\u2019s Troubled Assets Relief program (TARP) is likely to be used in capital infusion, although asset purchases as originally planned cannot be ruled out, analyst Alexopoulos said.\n\nThe Bush administration on Wednesday largely abandoned its plan to buy up toxic mortgage assets and said it will focus its $700 billion financial bailout fund on making direct investments in financial institutions and shoring up consumer credit markets.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department initially promoted the financial rescue package approved by Congress last month as a vehicle to buy illiquid mortgage assets from banks and other institutions to spur fresh lending.\n\nA weak economic environment through the year-end will put pressure on valuations of the banks, Alexopoulos said. \u201cThe economy is in a recession with the question now, in our view, being how deep and for how long.\u201d\n\nPeople\u2019s United and PrivateBancorp are well-positioned to gain from a negative impact on their competitors amid an economic slowdown, the analyst said.

        "body": "Nov 13 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded General Motors Corp (GM.N) to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight,\u201d citing ambiguity of the U.S. government aid structure, and particularly its potential dilutive impact on equity.\n\nAnalyst Himanshu Patel said what is needed was near-term liquidity relief coupled with a comprehensive re-cut of the automaker\u2019s operational and financial cost burdens. \u201cWe estimate GM needs at least $15 billion to get to 2009-end, and something immediately to make it past December 2008,\u201d Patel wrote in a note to clients. Patel, who doubts whether the federal package currently discussed is likely to succeed, said the government could also help directly stimulate auto sales.\n\nThe government should not be fooled into believing that GM -- whose bailout alone could easily reach $30 billion -- simply needs enough to \u201cget to 2010,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nEarlier this month, GM and Ford Motor Co (F.N) reported far deeper-than-expected quarterly losses and said their rate of cash burn had accelerated.\n\nPatel said the government should provide a near-term loan to cover one to two quarters of cash burn, but a second sleeve of additional aid should be contingent on a re-cut of both financial debt and (United Auto Workers) UAW legacy liabilities, and after GM draws up a plan to accelerate dealer network and brand cuts.\n\nAsking taxpayers for a second auto bailout could prove very politically challenging, he said.\n\n\u201cGM shares have obvious downside risks if aid is not obtained or if in an out-of-court restructuring entirely cancels the equity,\u201d Patel wrote.\n\nGM shares closed at $3.08 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
