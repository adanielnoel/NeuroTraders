        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Cazenove said on Monday that former Barclays Plc (BARC.L) finance director Naguib Kheraj will take over as its new chief executive in October.\n\nThe investment bank said on Monday he will take up the position on October 6, filling the gap left at the helm of one of Britain\u2019s best-known corporate advisors since its last chief executive stepped down in March.\n\nAnalysts said Kheraj was well respected at Barclays and his resignation in October 2006 was a surprise but was partly blamed on the increasing regulatory burden on a finance director and limited chance to move up to chief executive in the near future.\n\nAt the time analysts said the well-connected Kheraj was likely to return to investment banking or private equity.\n\nJPMorgan Cazenove was set up in 2005 by British brokerage Cazenove and U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N).\n\nCazenove is financial adviser to Barclays so Kheraj had links with JPMorgan Cazenove during the decade he spent at Britain\u2019s third biggest bank.\n\nAged 44, he was Barclays finance director for three years and before that held senior positions at investment bank Barclays Capital and its wealth management and fund management arms. He was previously chief financial officer in Europe for Salomon Brothers (C.N).\n\n\u201cBoth we and our clients are very fortunate that he (Kheraj) will now be leading this firm as it consolidates its position as the UK\u2019s foremost investment bank and builds on its international franchise,\u201d JPMorgan Cazenove\u2019s chairman, David Mayhew, said in a statement.\n\nMayhew, a Cazenove veteran who acted as the venture\u2019s chief executive while a successor was sought, added on a conference call with journalists that JPMorgan Cazenove had no job-cutting program in place and would continue to hire selectively.\n\nMany global banks have been reducing headcount since the credit crunch took hold last August.\n\nHe was paid over 5 million pounds ($9.9 million) by Barclays in 2007, mainly due to 4.9 million pounds for advisory work from May to December related to the failed attempt to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro.\n\nAs finance director from January 2007 to March 2007 he earned 657,000 pounds in salary and bonus. He was paid 2.6 million pounds in 2006.\n\nHe also advises Britain\u2019s Financial Services Authority on supervision of banks. He has been in that part-time role since April.",
