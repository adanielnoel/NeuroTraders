        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is expected to acquire the deposits of Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), the largest U.S. savings and loan, in a government-brokered bailout, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The purchase could be a major step in cleaning up a U.S. financial system littered with toxic mortgage debt. Acquiring the deposits could fulfill JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon\u2019s long-held goal of becoming a retail banking force in the western United States. It comes six months after JPMorgan, the No. 3 U.S. bank, agreed to acquire the failing investment bank Bear Stearns Cos at a fire-sale price. Branches would also be included in the transaction, the newspaper said. JPMorgan said it would hold an investor conference call at 9:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, but it did not say why. Neither company returned calls for comment. The deposit acquisition is not likely to affect the roughly $45.2 billion insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), which analysts expect will be tapped dozens of times in the next few years to cover bank failures. It also comes as Washington wrangles over the fate of a $700 billion bailout of the financial services industry, which has been battered by mortgage defaults and tight credit conditions. \u201cJamie Dimon is clearly feeling that he has an opportunity to grab market share, and get it at fire-sale prices,\u201d said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. \u201cHe\u2019s becoming an acquisition machine.\u201d JPMorgan ended June with $1.78 trillion of assets, $722.9 billion of deposits and 3,157 branches. Washington Mutual ended June with $309.7 billion of assets, $181.9 billion of deposits, 2,239 branches and 43,198 employees. Shares of Washington Mutual plunged 80 cents to 89 cents in after-hours trading after falling 57 cents to $1.69 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. NEGOTIATIONS A transaction would follow more than a week of negotiations over the fate of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, which attracted interest from several large North American and European banks, as well as private equity firms, despite soaring mortgage losses and evaporating investor confidence. It also appears to be a costly defeat for David Bonderman and his private equity firm TPG Inc TPG.UL, which in April invested $2 billion in Washington Mutual as part of a $7 billion capital-raising by the thrift. TPG was not available for comment. Washington Mutual\u2019s $227 billion book of real estate loans, more than half of which comes from home equity loans, and adjustable-rate and subprime mortgages now considered risky, ensconced the thrift on the critical list of financial institutions needing help, analysts said. Its fate appeared to grow more precarious after problems with mortgage-related debt led to last week\u2019s bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and the near demise of insurance company American International Group Inc (AIG.N). The addition of Washington Mutual would make JPMorgan close in size to Citigroup Inc (C.N), now the largest U.S. bank by assets. It would trail Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) assuming that bank, which now ranks second in assets, completes its planned purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N. Once something of a golden child at Citigroup Inc (C.N) before Sanford \u201cSandy\u201d Weill engineered his ouster in 1998, Dimon has been carving for himself something of a role as a Wall Street savior. Some historians see parallels with the legendary financier John Pierpont Morgan, who ran J.P. Morgan & Co and was credited with intervening to end a banking panic in 1907. Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has also been credited with helping steady Wall Street, or at least reduce damage, with his acquisitions this year of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial Corp, the troubled mortgage lender that was once the nation\u2019s largest. HARD-HIT It was not immediately clear how much of Washington Mutual\u2019s loans might have been eligible for the bailout. The thrift has a significant presence in California and Florida, two of the states hardest hit by the nation\u2019s housing crisis. It also has a significant presence in the New York City area. The thrift had long been expected to sell itself after amassing $6.3 billion of losses in the previous three quarters. It had also projected $19 billion of mortgage losses through 2011, but many analysts said that was too low. Washington Mutual earlier this month ousted Chief Executive Kerry Killinger, who spearheaded the thrift\u2019s growth as well as its expansion in subprime and other risky mortgages, and replaced him with Alan Fishman, the former chief executive of Brooklyn, New York\u2019s Independence Community Bank Corp.

        "body": "By Elinor Comlay NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the acquisition of Washington Mutual Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is starting to look a little more like this century\u2019s incarnation of John Pierpont Morgan. Morgan, who established the original J.P. Morgan & Co in 1871, organized a rescue of the banking system in the Panic of 1907. More than 100 years later, Dimon is buying failed banks in the midst of financial chaos. The parallel is far from perfect. Dimon\u2019s rescues are first and foremost meant to be good deals for shareholders, and not necessarily noble efforts to stabilize the financial world. But in an era of faltering financial institutions, Dimon\u2019s JPMorgan, now the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, seems about as strong as Morgan\u2019s did. He acquired investment bank Bear Stearns Cos in May through a government-financed fire sale, and agreed to acquire Washington Mutual\u2019s assets after the government took control of the largest U.S. savings and loan on Thursday. Dimon, 52, has been something of a golden child on Wall Street ever since he was a protege of Sanford \u201cSandy\u201d Weill at the company that would become Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan\u2019s chief New York commercial banking rival. JPMorgan edged out Citi, among others, in acquiring Washington Mutual. Several books profiling Dimon are in the works, as his comments on Wall Street, its foibles and the U.S. economy become more influential. This is partly because JPMorgan has avoided much of the credit mess that has embroiled competitors and left Bear Stearns hobbled, Lehman Brothers bankrupt and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc sold to Bank of America Corp. \u201cI think Jamie has earned the right by his performance to be a spokesman that people should pay attention to,\u201d Weill, the former Citigroup chief executive and chairman, said in an interview with Reuters in July. As for investors, JPMorgan shares have through Thursday dropped 0.4 percent or 19 cents this year, finishing on Thursday at $43.46, compared with an 18.7 percent slide in the KBW Banks Index. With his latest acquisition of the assets of the country\u2019s largest savings and loan, Dimon again took the statesman\u2019s role while snaring the deal for JPMorgan. \u201cHe has been a good risk manager. He has been able to reap the benefits,\u201d said Rick Meckler, chief investment officer of LibertyView Capital Management. NO SHRINKING PERSONALITY Robert Bruner, author of \u201cThe Panic of 1907\u201d and dean of the Darden Business School at the University of Virginia, told Reuters in July that he sees some similarities between John Pierpont Morgan\u2019s handling of the 1907 financial markets\u2019 crisis and Dimon\u2019s acquisition of investment bank Bear Stearns. JPMorgan took over Bear Stearns after the latter suffered the equivalent of a bank run. Part of the reason JPMorgan became involved was that it was considered by the government to be the financial institution best equipped to absorb the 85-year-old company. \u201cHe sets an example at an institution that is itself exemplar,\u201d Bruner said. After leaving Citigroup, Dimon became chief executive at Chicago\u2019s underperforming Bank One Corp, where he slashed costs and improved operations. He engineered that bank\u2019s $58 billion takeover by JPMorgan in 2004. Dimon is known for being boisterous, opinionated and unafraid to speak his mind, even if it means talking over colleagues on calls with analysts and investors. People who know him say Dimon cuts his peers no slack. On a conference call for Wall Street chieftains while JPMorgan was rescuing Bear Stearns, Dimon shot down a somewhat technical question from Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who has a doctorate in finance. According to published reports, Dimon told Pandit: \u201cStop being such a jerk.\u201d \u0298",

Capital markets could restructure existing mortgage bonds to create securities, backed by the 60 percent balance, that are government-guaranteed for a period, they said.\n\nThe \u201csuper senior\u201d securities would sell at yields only slightly higher than \u201cagency\u201d mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, they said.\n\nAddressing home prices is critical amid expectations for an additional 5.5 million foreclosures over the next five years, on top of about 2 million already in or through the process, they said. Outside of loans in U.S. mortgage programs, the government would buy some $1.05 trillion in loans for a price of $630 billion over five years, they said.\n\nTotal losses on liquidated mortgages average less than 40 percent, so the program should be self-funding, they said.\n\nThe plan should be pursued independently of decisions to participate in the purchase or sale of securities backed by the loans, they said. Lawmakers on Thursday were close to agreement on a massive $700 billion plan to buy illiquid mortgage assets in a bid to stabilize financial markets.\n\n\u201dThe new program will put the government at the throttle of foreclosure supply, ending the destructive distressed selling that has been wreaking havoc\u201c on home prices,\u201d they said.
