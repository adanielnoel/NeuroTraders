Morgan Securities upgraded Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d, citing positive results from a survey conducted among European physicians on the company\u2019s treatment for liver cancer.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, this survey clearly highlights the growth potential of Nexavar in Europe,\u201d said analyst Cory Kasimov, who noted that physicians estimate higher penetration in the market to treat liver cancer.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the brokerage, was to assess the current acceptance and the future outlook for the cancer drug Nexavar in treating liver cancer, in Europe, which Kasimov believes is the most important near-term lever for the company.\n\n\u201cWith a potential 60 percent 2008 to 2012 cumulative annual growth rate, and a pristine balance sheet, we believe Onyx is an attractive name to own as investors seek ideas in this challenging macro environment,\u201d he added.\n\nOnyx and its partner Bayer AG BAYG.DE plan to launch the drug in phases in Asia, a market which Kasimov called a \u201ccall option\u201d, due to many hurdles to use and lack of precedent.\n\nOnyx shares, which have lost more than a third of their value so far this year, closed at $30.09 Wednesday on Nasdaq.
