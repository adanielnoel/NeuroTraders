Standard\u2019s stock is trading at a premium, well above its peers, as it had risen 73 percent from its low on Aug. 25, the brokerage said.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc creditors are asking a U.S. judge to allow them to conduct depositions and access documents from JPMorgan Chase & Co, claiming JPMorgan prevented Lehman from accessing $17 billion in assets on the eve of its bankruptcy filing.\n\nIn court documents filed late last week, a group of unsecured creditors claimed that JPMorgan refused to let Lehman access assets and instead froze Lehman\u2019s account, triggering a liquidity crisis that led to the 158-year-old investment bank\u2019s collapse.\n\n\u201c(JPMorgan\u2018s) refusal to make those assets available to (Lehman) and its subsidiaries in the days leading up to (Lehman\u2018s) bankruptcy filing may have contributed to Lehman\u2019s liquidity constraints,\u201d the creditors said in the court documents.\n\nA lawyer for JPMorgan, however, disputed the $17 billion figure and said that JPMorgan had provided $87 billion in cash to facilitate trading at Lehman in the early days of its bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cTo say that somehow JPMorgan was inhibiting the liquidity just is not consistent with the facts,\u201d said Harold Novikoff, a lawyer representing JPMorgan in the case.\n\nThe creditor\u2019s committee said it believes had JPMorgan not taken those actions, Lehman\u2019s liquidity problems could have been averted.\n\nLehman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors Sep. 15, in the largest U.S. bankruptcy filing ever.\n\nBarclays Capital subsequently bought Lehman\u2019s core North American capital markets business, and other units are being sold off to other parties.\n\nJPMorgan has played a key role in the case since day one, as the firm regularly advanced billions to Lehman units to help clear and facilitate securities transactions with customers and clients of Lehman.\n\nThe creditors said in the court filing that JPMorgan held the $17 billion in excess assets as collateral, due to its role in providing cash advances to Lehman to fund overnight repurchase agreements.\n\nJPMorgan does not think that $17 billion is a \u201ccorrect valuation\u201d of the assets, Novikoff said. Novikoff said the figure overstates the amount of assets held, and appears to value some asset-backed commercial paper and collateralized loan obligations at face value when their market value is much lower.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is scheduled to have a hearing on the creditor\u2019s request next week.",

Trone now expects a loss of 10 cents a share in the third quarter compared to his prior view of profit of 32 cents a share.\n\nHe expects the company to record net marks of $4.3 billion in the quarter, comprising $2.0 billion on leveraged loans, $1.0 billion on mortgage assets, $1.2 billion loss on GSE securities and $400 million related to a settlement on auction rate securities. Trone also expects a $1.7 billion in reserve build associated with the Washington Mutual acquisition.\n\nThese losses will be partially offset by $300 million of liability valuation gains and a $700 million tax benefit, a large part of which will be in the investment bank, he added.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Trone raised earnings estimates to 86 cents a share from 79 cents a share, and for 2009 to $3.91 a share from $3.82 a share, citing net income contribution from Washington Mutual.\n\nJPMorgan may record reversal gains in the future from assets that were conservatively marked during the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual acquisitions, Trone said, adding that upward earnings revisions are likely.\n\nThe company will gain market share in the long term across its traditional banking and securities units, from the demise of some peers, he said.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s shares were down 5 percent at $43.66 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
