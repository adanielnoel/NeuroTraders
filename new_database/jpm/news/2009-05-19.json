        "body": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and several other banks eager to escape the restrictions and stigma linked to government bailout funds may get the chance to do so in the next few weeks.\n\nRegulators are talking to big banks that want to repay funds received under the government\u2019s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a Federal Reserve official said on Tuesday.\n\nNo announcements on returning funds will come until around June 8, the official added. The Fed official spoke on condition of anonymity because the application process is continuing.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon told shareholders he expects regulators will let a few strong banks repay TARP funds within weeks.\n\nDimon made it clear that he was eager to escape strict regulations on compensation and other areas for TARP participants. In particular, he called restrictions under the program on banks hiring foreign-born workers \u201ca complete and utter disgrace.\u201d\n\nSimilar concerns have been voiced by other TARP recipients Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley, which like JPMorgan recently submitted applications seeking permission to repay TARP funds, people familiar with the situation told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a big deal stock-price wise, but it is a huge deal competitively that they can use to their advantage,\u201d said Greg Donaldson, director of portfolio strategy at Donaldson Capital Management in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nRepaying the government funds will \u201ctake the handcuffs off the management of these companies,\u201d agreed Brad Hintz, analyst with Sanford C Bernstein in New York.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve told my clients is: \u2018You want to be the first one out of TARP and you certainly don\u2019t want to be the last one,'\u201d Hintz said.\n\nJPMorgan shares closed down 3.9 percent at $35.81 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThere are so many banks talking about repaying TARP that it\u2019s already priced in,\u201d Donaldson said.\n\nBank of America Corp, the largest U.S. bank, which has said it hopes to fully repay TARP funds within the next couple of years, priced an offering of about 800 million shares, raising some $8 billion after the market closed.\n\nThe stock sale may help the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender raise capital, after regulators told it to bolster its finances following a government \u201cstress test\u201d of its ability to handle a deep recession.\n\nLast October, the Treasury stepped in with $125 billion of bailout funds for nine of the largest U.S. banks, part of a plan to stabilize a system rocked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Regulators wanted banks to have enough capital to lend during one of the worst recessions since the 1930s.\n\nBanks asking to repay TARP are among the 19 institutions that submitted to the stress tests to determine their ability to withstand a sharp economic downturn, the Fed official said. Supervisors will seek more information from the banks and then recommend to Treasury whether to approve repayments.\n\nRecommendations will be made in batches, not on a case-by-case basis, the official said. Going forward, supervisors will make repayment recommendations to the Treasury on a monthly basis, the official added.\n\nBefore they make repayments, banks must show they can raise funds from private sources without any government guarantees.\n\nThese conditions have sparked a wave of stock and debt sales in recent weeks.\n\nGovernment officials have expressed concern that banks, in their eagerness to sever government ties, may return the capital too soon, only to need it again later.\n\nJPMorgan, which received $25 billion in funds in October, and Goldman, which received $10 billion, were found by the stress tests to have sufficient capital. Morgan Stanley received $10 billion in October and had a small capital shortfall under the stress tests, quickly erased by stock and debt sales.\n\nEven as banks line up to repay TARP funds, the U.S. Federal Reserve widened its safety net for downtrodden credit markets by making older commercial property loans eligible for an emergency program.\n\nThe move could help banks who are trying to move such loans off their balance sheets and allow borrowers to refinance existing loans on better terms.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is looking to launch its June pilot sale of banks\u2019 distressed loans without using TARP money to help private investors buy up the loans, a source familiar with government plans told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nThe FDIC is looking to do a test sale to make sure that investors, banks and the public are comfortable with the mechanics -- without the complication of government co-investment -- before rolling out the full program.\n\nSome potential investors have expressed concern that loan purchases done in partnership with government money from the TARP could expose them to executive pay restrictions and other TARP conditions.",

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court reinstated a claim by a JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) credit card holder accusing the bank of failing to properly disclose risk factors that allow it to suddenly raise rates.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said the bank failed to make \u201cclear and conspicuous disclosure\u201d of the annual percentage rates it could impose, as required under the federal Truth in Lending Act, by burying the reason for an increase in the fine print of a cardholder agreement.\n\nAccording to a three-judge panel, Chase had been charging Cheryl and Walter Barrer an 8.99 percent annual rate, when the amount suddenly \u201cskyrocketed\u201d to 24.24 percent, a level that was \u201cclose to a non-preferred or default rate.\u201d\n\nChase would maintain that it raised the rate after learning from a credit agency that the Barrers had too many loans and accounts, a conclusion they did not dispute.\n\nBut Judge Diarmuid O\u2018Scannlain, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, wrote that Chase\u2019s justification for the rate increase appeared on pages 10 and 11 of the Barrers\u2019 card agreement, \u201cfive dense pages after the disclosure of the APR.\u201d\n\nHe said this was \u201cburied too deeply in the fine print\u201d for a reasonable cardholder to realize the bank could raise the APR not just for events of default, but for \u201cany reason at all.\u201d\n\nThe panel returned the case to federal district court in Oregon, which had dismissed the Barrers\u2019 claim, for further proceedings.\n\nChase spokeswoman Stephanie Jacobson said the New York-based bank does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe ruling was announced on the same day the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill to curb sudden rate increases on credit cards. The House of Representatives approved a similar bill last month. President Barack Obama is expected to sign the measure into law later in May.\n\nThe case is Barrer v. Chase Bank USA, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, No. 07-35414.",
