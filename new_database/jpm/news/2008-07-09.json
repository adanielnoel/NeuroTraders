Weill was Dimon\u2019s mentor, and the two men worked for more than a decade to build what was once a small consumer lending company in Baltimore into Citigroup.\n\nWeill and Dimon were briefly estranged after the ouster, but reconciled in 1999.\n\nWeill said JPMorgan is in a position to further improve \u201cat a point of time when assets are being put on the market at very low prices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Jamie has done a very good job in being the leader of JPMorgan,\u201d said Weill, who said he last spoke to Dimon a few months ago.\n\nBanks have had a rough year and write-downs from losses on subprime mortgages and complex debt securities remain a concern.

        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street bank JP Morgan said on Tuesday crude oil futures may hit $150 later this month while its rival Lehman Brothers\u2019 LEH.N equities team raised their oil price estimates sharply.\n\nInternational benchmark U.S. crude futures CLc1 struck a record high of $145.85 a barrel last week due to a combination of robust demand growth from emerging markets such as China, concerns over long-term supplies and inflow of investors\u2019 money.\n\nOil\u2019s 50 percent rise this year has surpassed most analysts\u2019 expectations, prompting them to repeatedly revise their price forecasts.\n\n\u201cWith the $150 in easy reach and a significant number of outstanding August WTI call options at that strike price, it seems almost a certainty ahead of the July 22 expiry,\u201d JP Morgan (JPM.N) said in its monthly research note.\n\nThe bank said it expects the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), or the underlying grade of U.S. crude futures, to likely remain above $130 for the rest of the summer and $115 throughout this year even if demand weakens.\n\nPaul Cheng with Lehman Brothers\u2019 equity research team raised its oil price view to an average $127 a barrel for 2008 from its previous assumption of $105.\n\nHe expected oil prices would average $115 next year, compared with a previous forecast of $90, he said in a note.",

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon likes to talk.\n\nAnd in the wake of his masterminding the bailout of Bear Stearns Cos, many on Wall Street like to listen.\n\nDimon has long been something of a golden child on Wall Street, ever since he was a protege of Sanford \u201cSandy\u201d Weill at the company that would become Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan\u2019s chief New York commercial banking rival.\n\nSeveral books profiling the baby-faced Dimon are in the works, as his comments on Wall Street, its foibles and the economy grow more influential.\n\nPart of that is because JPMorgan has avoided much of the credit mess that has devastated rivals such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N.\n\n\u201cI think Jamie has earned the right by his performance to be a spokesman that people should pay attention to,\u201d Weill, the former Citigroup chief executive and chairman, said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nAvoiding problems is one reason JPMorgan shares have through Wednesday dropped only 17 percent this year, compared with a 28 percent slide in the Standard & Poor\u2019s Financials Index .GSPF.\n\nDimon\u2019s reputation and charisma is another reason.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Jamie Dimon premium\u201d in JPMorgan stock, said Richard Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.\n\n\u201cGiven that JPMorgan hasn\u2019t had a lot of the problems, it has allowed Jamie to step up and be a statesman and a spokesman for the entire industry.\u201d\n\nBut Bove said some worry Dimon\u2019s higher profile might lead him to set his sights farther afield. He questioned how long Dimon might stay with JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, but largest by market capitalization.\n\n\u201cMaybe he is going to get bored with running JPMorgan,\u201d said Bove, who suggested Washington D.C. as Dimon\u2019s next career move.\n\nBut Weill played down the possibility of Dimon heading for the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something he still might think,\u201d but that\u2019s something only Dimon could answer, he said.\n\nRobert Bruner, author of \u201cThe Panic of 1907\u201d and dean of the Darden Business School at the University of Virginia, sees parallels between John Pierpont Morgan\u2019s handling of the 1907 financial markets\u2019 crisis and Dimon\u2019s acquisition of Bear.\n\nJPMorgan took over Bear after the latter suffered the equivalent of a bank run.\n\nPart of the reason JPMorgan got involved was that it was the financial institution widely considered best equipped to swallow the 85-year-old investment bank.\n\n\u201cHe sets an example at an institution that is itself exemplar,\u201d Bruner said.\n\nAfter leaving Citigroup, Dimon became chief executive at Chicago\u2019s underperforming Bank One Corp, where he slashed costs and improved operations. He did so well that he engineered that bank\u2019s $58 billion takeover by JPMorgan in 2004.\n\nDimon, 52, is also known for his staccato, broken syntax, perhaps a function of his being boisterous, opinionated and unafraid to speak his mind.\n\nHe sometimes has to be physically restrained from barging in on colleagues\u2019 calls with analysts and investors.\n\nAnd he cuts his peers no slack, either.\n\nOn a conference call for Wall Street chieftains while JPMorgan was rescuing Bear, Dimon shot down a somewhat technical question from Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who has a doctorate in finance.\n\nAccording to published reports, Dimon told Pandit: \u201cStop being such a jerk.\u201d",
