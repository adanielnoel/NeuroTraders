Morgan Securities cut the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX index's year-end target and 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates, and said broad declines in jobs are going to be seen across many industries.\n\nThe brokerage cut its year-end target on S&P 500 to 1,000 from 1,125. The index closed at 876.07 Friday.\n\nThe unemployment rate is set to rise sharply in mining, business services, manufacturing and retail as the current rates in these sectors have not yet reached those seen in prior recessions, the brokerage said in a note dated Dec. 5.\n\nJP Morgan cut its earnings view on S&P 500 for 2008 by $5 to $71.50 a share, and for 2009 by $10 to $65.00, as part of its U.S. equity strategy.\n\nThe brokerage said most of the adjustments were in sectors severely affected by a deepening global recession and lower commodity prices, like energy, materials, industrials and technology.\n\n\u201cIn fact, this fits within our broader observations that expectations remain too high in those sectors,\u201d JP Morgan said.

        "body": "Dec 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its price targets on Boeing Co (BA.N) and its suppliers Precision Castparts PCP.N and Rockwell Collins (COL.N), citing further expected 787 delays and fewer estimated aircraft deliveries in 2009 and 2010.\n\nBoeing is expected to announce further delays to its new 787 Dreamliner after taking into account the damage of a two-month strike by its machinists and a number of production problems nagging at the program.\n\n\u201cWe expect the impact of the well-reported issues Boeing continues to experience on the 787 to delay first delivery until mid-2010, and we are now looking for 25 deliveries that year, down from 65 previously,\u201d analyst Joseph Nadol said.\n\nNadol, who rates Boeing \u201cneutral,\u201d cut his price target on the stock to $42 from $46.\n\nThe stock is down more than 50 percent in 2008, but there is room for only modest multiple expansion over the next year, given the uncertainty over delivery timing and profitability of the 787 Dreamliner program, and the relatively low growth potential of Boeing\u2019s defense portfolio, he said.\n\nNadol cut his price target on Precision Castparts to $74 from $80 and on Rockwell to $41 from $43. He rates both the stocks \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect Rockwell and Precision Castparts to trade at a premium in part due to the fact that 787 work should be more profitable for these two companies relative to others in commercial aerospace,\u201d Nadol wrote in a note to clients.\n\nRockwell makes flight-deck display, pilot controls and communication systems for 787. Precision Castparts makes engine parts and fasteners for Boeing.\n\nBoeing shares closed at $39.53, while Precision Castparts shares closed at $51.13 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Rockwell closed at $33.10. (Reporting by Bhaswati Mukhopadhyay in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)",

        "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The chief China economist of JPMorgan Chase warned on Monday that any mismanagement of the yuan exchange rate, towards excessive weakness of the currency, could hurt Chinese financial markets and the economy.\n\nFrank Gong also lowered his forecasts for the growth of China\u2019s economy in the fourth quarter of this year and next year, while expecting the government to take further steps to boost the real estate and equity markets.\n\nThe yuan CNF=CFXS slipped to a five-month low against the dollar last week, hitting the bottom of its daily trading band for the first time, as the currency market speculated that China might engineer moderate depreciation of the yuan to stimulate its slowing export sector.\n\nBut Gong said in an interview that he did not expect extended weakness of the yuan, and that Chinese authorities would be wrong to push it down significantly.\n\nGong predicted that in the next three months the yuan, which was at 6.8813 to the dollar early on Monday afternoon, would stay in a range of between 6.8 and 7.0. Between three and 12 months from now, it would appreciate around 3 percent, he predicted.\n\nDepreciation of the yuan could trigger competitive depreciation of other Asian currencies, which would not help Chinese exporters, he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cMismanagement of the renminbi could cause huge capital outflows and destabilise the A-share market and property market at a time when confidence is low,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cChinese exporters are still outperforming. China should not resort to devaluation and it would be a wrong policy.\u201d\n\nBut Gong said China\u2019s economy now risked a serious slowdown, and growth might not bottom out until the second quarter of 2009.\n\n\u201cOur view is near-term risks will be on the downside. We have very low expectations for fourth-quarter growth. Basically, we are looking for no growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis for the fourth quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nGong cut his forecast for annual growth of China\u2019s gross domestic product in the current quarter to 7.7 percent, from 8.2 percent predicted one month ago.\n\nHe reduced his forecast for GDP growth in all of 2008 to 9.2 percent from 9.4 percent, and his prediction for next year\u2019s growth to 8.0 percent from 8.1 percent.\n\nGong expects growth to hit a low of 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2009 before recovering to 7.7 percent in the third quarter and 9.9 percent in the fourth.\n\nThe bounce-back in late 2009 would mainly be propelled by a 4 trillion yuan ($580 billion) economic stimulus plan announced by the government last month.\n\n\u201cAnd that may not be the end of the story.

However, we are not ruling out the possibility for the index to test a new low again in the first quarter of next year\u201d because of negative news on corporate earnings.\n\n\u201cOverall, recovery of the market will be very slow.\u201d",
