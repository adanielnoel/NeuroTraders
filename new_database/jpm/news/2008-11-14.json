Fuller Co (FUL.N) to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral,\u201d saying the company is expected to benefit from lower raw material costs in 2009 and the shares are inexpensive at the current price.\n\nOil and Natural gas derivatives are the major raw materials for the company and crude and gas prices are currently at 50 percent lower from their recent peaks, analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas said.\n\n\u201cWe note that each 1 percent change in raw material costs represents about 11 cents a share benefit to 2009 EPS,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nSuch a significant upside from lower input costs should offset volume contraction, weaker pricing and currency headwinds, resulting in decent earnings generation next year, he wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe analyst said the fourth quarter may bring some earnings disappointment, as he expects a two to three month lag between lower spot raw material prices and actual lower feedstock costs for the company.\n\nNegative volumes and currency headwinds are also expected to be a drag, said Zekauskas, who has a price target of $19 on the stock.\n\nShares of the company closed at $16.57 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
