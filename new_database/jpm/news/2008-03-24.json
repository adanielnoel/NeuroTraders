That value has since risen to about $2.52 per share because JPMorgan stock has since risen.\n\nBear shares closed Thursday at $6.39, a premium to the merger price, because some investors hope the company will find another buyer or JPMorgan will increase its offer.\n\nThe merger requires shareholder approval. Some investors, including Joseph Lewis, who has lost some $1 billion on his Bear investment, have said the terms could be better.\n\nBarron\u2019s said a sweetened JPMorgan offer is more likely than an alternative bid. It said few financial companies have the capacity to take on Bear\u2019s obligations, or would want to upset federal regulators that blessed the transaction. It also said private equity firms lack the means to make counterbids.\n\nIn addition, the newspaper said JPMorgan included deterrents to potential bidders, including an option to buy Bear\u2019s glittering Manhattan headquarters for $1.1 billion.\n\nBarron\u2019s said JPMorgan isn\u2019t commenting, but might raise the price to clinch the merger and quell critics. It said JPMorgan could easily pay $1 billion to $2 billion more for Bear, especially after netting $1.3 billion of cash last week from Visa Inc\u2019s (V.N) initial public offering.",

The agreement also makes clear JPMorgan would not back up the trading business if Bear\u2019s board chooses a rival acquirer.\n\n\u201cIf Bear\u2019s board recommends a competing proposal, the guaranty would cease to exist for all obligations then outstanding or created in the future,\u201d JPMorgan said in a note explaining the new pact.\n\nUnder the original guaranty agreement, JPMorgan assumed responsibility for Bear\u2019s trading obligations until the deal\u2019s completion. That support was vital since many traders grew convinced two weeks ago Bear was likely to go bust, so they took their business and their cash elsewhere.\n\nUnder the new agreement, JPMorgan\u2019s support for Bear trades falls away only if Bear recommends a topping bid from a more credit-worthy buyer.\n\nSources familiar with the deal say it is unlikely that Bear could find someone who meets the criteria of higher credit standards than JPMorgan, which is among a very few banks to have escaped major damage from the credit crunch.\n\nThe new agreement, by asserting it will remain in place except under some unlikely circumstances, is expected to give traders greater confidence in doing business with Bear.\n\nAlso, few bidders would likely have the same level of support from the Federal Reserve.\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan took other steps Monday to close the door on rival bidders and expedite its own deal.\n\nNotably, JPMorgan maintained an option to acquire Bear\u2019s valuable midtown headquarters for a below-market $1.1 billion if the bank were outbid by another buyer or if Bear went into liquidation.\n\nUnder the new agreement, if the deal does not go through for any reason, Bear Stearns still gets to buy the building.",

With those shares, JPMorgan would own 39.5 percent of Bear Stearns and have secured the backing of Bear Chairman James Cayne, owner of a 3 percent stake in Bear.\n\n\u201cIt looks like JPMorgan has this deal sewn up right now,\u201d said John Augustine, chief investment strategist with Fifth Third Investment Advisors.\n\nThe new offer valued Bear Stearns at about $2.1 billion, compared with $236 million under the original deal.\n\nAdditionally, JPMorgan would also be on the hook for the first $1 billion in losses stemming from Bear Stearns\u2019 less liquid assets, and would set aside $6 billion to cover severance, litigation and other transaction-related costs.\n\nThe new deal, which has financial backing from the Federal Reserve, is likely to raise concerns that the U.S. government is prepared to help rescue Wall Street bankers even as millions of home owners face the possibility of foreclosure. (For more details, see [ID:nN24322534].)\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York is providing $29 billion in special financing for the deal and will take control of a $30 billion portfolio of Bear\u2019s less liquid assets.\n\n\u201cThis action is being taken by the Federal Reserve, with the support of the Treasury Department, to bolster market liquidity and promote orderly market functioning,\u201d the New York Fed said in a statement.\n\nRather than a bailout of Bear, the Fed\u2019s action \u201cmore closely resembles the torpedoing of a sinking ship\u201d to remove a hazard to others and avert a broader crisis, said David Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor\u2018s.\n\n\u201cThe bank is dead,\u201d he said.\n\nJPMorgan, facing pressure from disgruntled Bear shareholders such as British billionaire Joe Lewis, raised its offer to about $10 a share in stock from its original bid on March 16 of $2 per share for the 85-year-old Wall Street investment bank, representing a boon to short-term traders who jumped in last week when the shares plunged.\n\nWhile the new offer represents a less onerous fire-sale price, it is still 68 percent below the March 14 closing price of Bear shares of $30.85, and more than 90 percent below Bear\u2019s all time peak level of over $170.\n\nBear, recently ranked as the fifth-largest U.S. investment bank, collapsed as large subprime mortgage losses and falling confidence in the company prompted a run on the bank.\n\n\u201cWe believe the amended terms are fair to all sides and reflect the value and risks of the Bear Stearns franchise,\u201d Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to a prompt closing.\u201d\n\nBear shares surged 76 percent to close at $11.25, as some investors speculated on an even higher offer.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co appeared to have a near guarantee on getting its takeover of Bear Stearns Co Inc approved by shareholders under a sweetened deal announced on Monday, but that doesn\u2019t mean the pact will be free of legal challenges.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether JPMorgan\u2019s new $10-a-share bid -- up from $2 a share initially -- will appease Bear Stearns shareholders who say the financially strapped company is being sold for a song. With the stock trading above $11 on Monday afternoon, some investors were betting a higher offer could emerge.\n\nFor shareholders who oppose the takeover and believe the company can command a higher price, there may be some legal avenues they can pursue to try to nix the deal or change its terms, corporate law experts say. Still, they say, it would likely be an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of stopping this with an injunction is very difficult,\u201d said Michael Kelly, a partner at law firm McCarter & English who specializes in corporate litigation.\n\nOne thing shareholders may scrutinize is a so-called \u201cdeal protection\u201d device in the revised bid that allows JPMorgan to buy 39.5 percent of newly issued Bear Stearns\u2019 common stock at $10 a share.\n\nTogether with a 3.6 percent stake held by Bear Stearns\u2019 board members, that would give JPMorgan more than 43 percent of the vote when the deal is put to shareholders -- greatly increasing the likelihood that it will win majority approval.\n\nLegal experts say deal challengers could try to argue that Bear\u2019s board, by agreeing to sell this large chunk of stock, is now essentially barring any other viable bidders from coming on the scene, said Gordon Smith, a corporate law expert and professor at Brigham Young University\u2019s law school.\n\nSuch a move could raise questions about whether the board is performing its fiduciary duty to get the best offer for the company, from either JPMorgan or another entity.\n\n\u201cWhat the plaintiffs would have to show is that the board has acted in a way that precludes the other shareholders from accepting a third-party offer, or coerces them to accept this offer,\u201d he said.\n\nIf there are legal challenges, Smith said, JPMorgan would likely argue that the deal protection provision was needed to get the agreement done, and that it was part of the negotiations that led to the increased purchase price.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange typically requires shareholder approval before a company can issue stock that is convertible into more than 20 percent of the outstanding shares, but there is an exception in cases when a company\u2019s financial viability is at stake. Bear Stearns\u2019 audit committee recommended, and the full board \u201chas unanimously concurred with, Bear Stearns\u2019 intended use of the exception,\u201d the two companies said on Monday.\n\nWhile there could be court challenges to the proposed buyout and share sale agreed to by Bear Stearns\u2019 board, corporate directors typically are given wide latitude by the courts with judges reluctant to second-guess their decisions, Kelly said.\n\nIn this case, it would be hard to argue that Bear Stearns\u2019 board had many other options, given that the deal won financial backing from the Federal Reserve as the company faced possible collapse because of a credit crunch.\n\nLegal experts said there was a threat of litigation but did not know of any lawsuits challenging the deal. JPMorgan said it expects to complete the purchase of the new shares by April 8. The date of the vote by Bear\u2019s shareholders has not been set.\n\nAlso, Kelly said, no other bidders have emerged that a court could look to in the event of deal challenges, when it weighs the best alternatives for Bear Stearns.\n\n\u201cIf there are other buyers, where are they?\u201d he said.",

They said the deal should be completed on or about April 8.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s $30 billion special financing has also been amended.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t know how you could put a deal like that together in two or three days and have all your t\u2019s crossed and your i\u2019s dotted. That\u2019s a very complex thing to put together.\n\n\u201dI would imagine that they are starting to step back and look at it and say, \u2018OK, what\u2019s really here?\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Gee, this is going to make the folks that work there happy.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how $10 is going to make you five times happier than $2 when it was worth a $100 six months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201dSo are people going to be dancing in the halls?

You don\u2019t want to show the other person what your cards are and you want to try and create a bluff and I think that\u2019s what you are into.\u201d\n\n\u201dAs long as the Fed has signed off on this revised deal, this is great for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how this will impact the shares of Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs as well as the rumors surrounding these companies regarding their financial health. This may be the bottom for the financial sector.\u201d\n\n\u201dAt first glance, it looked like JPMorgan was forced to the table and did a throwaway bid. Then when they went in to reevaluate -- first Bear Stearns and then the market -- and (found) even at $10 a share it\u2019s an outstanding value.\n\n\u201cIt fits well with their business and they can feel comfortable that they are not overpaying. The market feels a little better about it since JPMorgan has an inside view, and found (Bear Stearns) is not a total basket case.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe (bond) market traded lower throughout the morning on expectations for the JPMorgan bid for Bear to be increased, and it was -- up to $10 share and for 39.5 percent of the firm -- with JPMorgan agreeing to guarantee Bear\u2019s first $1 billion of any losses on financed assets, with the Fed on the hook for the remaining $29 billion of the $30 billion of borrowings.\n\n\u201dI\u2019d certainly expect that Jamie Dimon would not put a number out there if it wasn\u2019t likely to be the best and final offer.\n\n\u201dI believe (Dimon) figured out that there\u2019s a price he can insure certainty of the deal. It\u2019s a very sound insurance policy that the deal goes through.\n\n\u201cYou had a lot of people buying last week buying stock at 3-7 dollars a share who will make a quick profit and therefore would vote their shares -- particularly the bondholders who were buying stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too excited about positive news in the financials. The economy is still lacking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bear Stearns deal is encouraging for the market -- $2 was a very good deal for JPMorgan but not necessary fair for the Bear Stearns shareholders, and this is certainly getting closer to fair.\u201d\n\n\u201dQuite frankly, I thought there was a deal. Apparently to expedite it, it appeared JPMorgan had to step up and pay more.\n\n\u201dI think the revision with the Fed is also curious.\n\n\u201cI think this is about the Fed trying to save face, and I think this is about Bear Stearns trying to save face.\u201d\n\n\u201dJamie Dimon says the amended terms are fair for all sides. That implies the old deal was not fair. And if $2 was not fair, why is $10 fair?\n\n\u201dClearly this increases the chance the deal goes through, but there are still going to be employees and shareholders unhappy with $10 a share.\n\nSome investors will probably try to block it in the courts. At the end of the day, JPMorgan has such a strong hand, and Bear Stearns is so weak, JPMorgan will likely win, but the biggest winners here will likely be the lawyers.\u201d",

Employees who are not offered jobs will receive at least a cash bonus of about 30 percent of their 2007 compensation if they stay through the completion of the deal, the source said.\n\nIt is unclear whether Bear Stearns employees, who own about 30 percent of the firm, were swayed by the offer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more questions than answers at this point,\u201d said a person familiar with the workings at Bear Stearns.\n\nSpokesmen for JPMorgan and Bear Stearns declined to comment.\n\nFaced with a sudden cash crunch that threatened it with collapse, Bear Stearns agreed to an all-stock takeover offer from JPMorgan that values the storied investment bank at about $285 million. A week ago it was valued at more than $8 billion.\n\nThe fire sale offer of about $2.41 a share at current market prices shocked Bear Stearns employees, who saw much of their savings evaporate. Layoffs are all but certain, though the extent of the job losses is not yet clear.\n\nWith Bear Stearns employees unsettled, recruiters sense an opportunity. A Google search for \u201cfinancial services brokers\u201d brought up a link tagged \u201cBear Stearns Brokers\u201d that connected to the Web site of executive search firm Willis Consulting Inc. The sponsored link, however, has since been removed.\n\n\u201cThis opens up opportunities for us,\u201d said Audrey Cullen Davis, president of First Call Associates, a recruiter that specializes in commodities and energy trading.\n\n\u201cFor individuals that may not have taken the time to speak with us, now they\u2019re more interested in knowing what other opportunities they may be able to consider,\u201d said Davis, whose firm represents investment banks, commodities traders and private equity firms.\n\nAs part of the deal, JPMorgan secured special Federal Reserve financing for $30 billion of Bear Stearns\u2019 less liquid assets. The agreement also includes an option that gives JPMorgan the right to buy Bear Stearns\u2019 valuable Manhattan headquarters, even if the deal is voted down by shareholders.\n\nThe transaction, seen as leaving little room for a counter offer, is a plum deal for JPMorgan, according to analysts. The firm\u2019s shares have risen more than 20 percent this week and were up nearly 8 percent to $45.82 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nBear Stearns shares were up 66 cents, or 12.5 percent, to $5.92, buoyed by hopes of a better offer after tycoon Joseph Lewis, who owns 8.35 percent of Bear Stearns\u2019 shares, said he would talk with the bank and others about possible options.",
