        "body": "NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks headed for a modest bounce at the open on Tuesday, with investors likely to scour the market for beaten-down shares in sectors such as financials after Wall Street skidded to a 12-year low a day earlier.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX will start the regular session less than three points from a fresh bear market low, raising the potential for the market to sink on any fresh signs of economic gloom.\n\nGains from bargain-hunting could be tempered by caution, however, with key economic reports set to show consumer confidence again hit a record low in February and further deterioration in housing.\n\nEven so, shares of JPMorgan (JPM.N) climbed 5.2 percent to $20.53 before the bell after Citigroup raised its first-quarter profit view on the bank.\n\nAfter the bell on Monday JPMorgan announced an 87 percent cut in its dividend to conserve capital and said it has been \u201csolidly profitable\u201d this quarter. Bank of America (BAC.N) rose 2.6 percent to $4.01 before the bell while Citigroup (C.N) shares added 4.7 percent to $2.24.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a bounce after yesterday\u2019s steep declines on bargain hunting,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York. \u201cBut again we are in a technical breakdown. The market is full of fear. The downward trend has still not been broken.\u201d\n\nS&P 500 futures SPc1 rose 1.70 points, and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 climbed 17 points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures gained 4.75 points.\n\nYear-to-date, the S&P 500 index is down 17.7 percent, and off 52.1 percent from the October 2007 record peak, a drop stemming largely from worries about the deepening recession and concerns about the health of the banking sector.\n\nIn earnings news, leading U.S. home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) posted a fourth-quarter operating profit above Wall Street\u2019s estimates. For more see [ID:nN24342453]. The stock was up almost 6 percent to $19.80 before the bell.\n\nAccording to Reuters data, the S&P 500 is at its most oversold in three months when measured by its 50-day relative strength index.\n\nTestimony from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke may offer clues on additional steps that could be taken to halt a sharp dive in the economy and he will likely be pressed on government plans to clean up the financial sector.\n\nHe is due to deliver the Fed\u2019s semiannual monetary policy report to Congress over two days, starting at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).\n\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for December and the fourth quarter is due at 9 a.m. (1400 GMT), while a report on consumer confidence is due at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).

        "body": "BANGALORE, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index .SPX could rise as much as 8 percent in the near term, according to a JP Morgan Securities strategist who believes the recent sell off in the index owes more to a capitulation by investors than fears of nationalization of banks.\n\nStrategist Thomas Lee set a \u201ctrading buy\u201d rating and short-term target of 800 on the index, with a stop-loss at 725.\n\nOn Monday, the S&P 500 index ended at 743.33 points, its lowest close in 13 years, as concerns grew that the nationalization of banks is not the right approach to bring the battered U.S. economy back on track.\n\nBut strategist Lee said the KBW Bank index .BKX has been relatively flat, while the S&P 500 has declined 5 percent since the middle of last week. If nationalization fears were behind the sell-off, the KBW Bank index should be lower, he said.\n\nUnlike equities, credit markets have not significantly declined after the U.S. stimulus package was unveiled. Lee views this divergence as a positive as credit markets have led almost every stock market rebound since 1900.\n\nPrices of U.S. Treasury bonds, seen as a safe haven, have rallied on deepening concerns about the fragile banking system and global economy. Recently, they have also risen on speculation about the nationalization of banks.\n\nIn contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, which on Monday started higher with speculation of a larger government stake in Citigroup (C.N), touched a 12-year low on fears that the bank stabilization plan would not be enough to keep the economy from sliding into a deeper crisis.\n\nStocks briefly came off lows after the White House reiterated that a privately held banking system regulated by the government was still the best way to operate.\n\nSeparately, Credit Suisse said on Tuesday stock prices will largely follow company results until the United States showed clear signs of a workable scheme for \u201cbad\u201d banks and insurances, and Japan was willing to pursue aggressive fiscal easing.\n\nThe brokerage cut its target on the S&P 500 index to 920 from 1050.\n\n\u201cWe continue to prefer corporate bonds, convertibles and index linked to equities, but believe investors should be a small overweight of equities,\u201d analyst Andrew Garthwaite wrote in a note to clients.\n\nStocks may have hit a bottom at current levels as the geo-political backdrop, corporate cost-cutting policy response and broader monetary and fiscal policy response are all better than historic norms, the analyst said.\n\nGarthwaite, who believes credit offers \u201dexcellent\u201c value,\u201d echoed J.P. Morgan\u2019s Lee\u2019s views on the relation between credit and equity markets.\n\n\u201cWhen credit rallies, so normally do equities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose about 2 percent to 758.39 points Tuesday morning.
