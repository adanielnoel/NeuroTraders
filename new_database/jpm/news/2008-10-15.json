        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s (JPM.N) quarterly profit fell 84 percent, due to mark-downs on underperforming loans, but the results still beat analysts\u2019 forecasts.\n\nJPMorgan, whose shares slipped 2.5 percent in pre-market trading, was hit by weakness in its leveraged lending and mortgage-related portfolios, underscoring the strains of the credit crisis.\n\n\u201cGiven the uncertainty in the capital markets, housing sector and economy overall, it is reasonable to expect reduced earnings for our firm over the next few quarters,\u201d Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.\n\nThe bank\u2019s adjusted loss of 6 cents per share, before an extraordinary gain related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual\u2019s banking operations, beat analyst expectations of a loss of 29 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.\n\nThird quarter net income fell to $527 million, or 11 cents a share, from $3.37 billion, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s shares initially rose in premarket trading, but then turned lower and were down a bit less than 1 percent.\n\nThe bank, which is set to get a $25 billion cash injection from the U.S. government\u2019s financial rescue package, last month sold $10 billion of stock to fund its $1.9 billion acquisition of Washington Mutual Inc.\n\nThe takeover, which followed seizure of WaMu by regulators, was JPMorgan\u2019s second this year of a financial institution on the verge of collapse. In March, it agreed to buy stricken investment bank Bear Stearns Cos Inc.\n\nThe purchase of Wamu, the largest bank to fail in U.S. history, saddled the bank with the troublesome mortgages that caused painful write-downs and credit losses for the thrift. As part of the acquisition, JPMorgan wrote down more than $30 billion and said it would incur $1.5 billion in pre-tax costs.\n\nThe bank posted a write-down of $3.6 billion from its investment banking operations, taking its total credit losses and write-downs since the credit crunch began last year to $12.3 billion, still far below that of peers such as Citigroup Inc (C.N), which has posted over $50 billion.\n\nShares in JPMorgan fell $1.01 to $39.70 in pre-market trading, from $40.71 on Tuesday.",

Profit dropped 25 percent at Wells Fargo, which is buying Wachovia Corp WB.N in a transaction originally valued at $15.1 billion.\n\nJPMorgan and Wells Fargo are betting they can handle the risks stemming from their acquisition targets, which were felled by losses tied to home loans.\n\nBoth banks are well-capitalized and are adding deposits as nervous customers flee weaker rivals. They are receiving even more capital as part of the U.S. government plan to inject $250 billion into the financial system.\n\n\u201cPeople are realizing there are interesting tools being put in place to deal with the credit crisis, but there\u2019s going to be a lag time to get them to work,\u201d said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co in Boston.\n\nShares of both banks fell in pre-market trade after a government report showing disappointing September U.S. retail sales heightened recession fears. But at mid-morning JPMorgan was up 63 cents to $41.34, while Wells Fargo added 58 cents to $34.10.\n\nProfit at New York-based JPMorgan tumbled to $527 million, or 11 cents per share, from $3.37 billion, or 97 cents, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding one-time items, the bank had a loss of 6 cents per share, compared with the average analyst forecast for a loss of 29 cents, Reuters Estimates said. Net revenue fell 9 percent to $14.74 billion, topping the average forecast of $14.62 billion.\n\nJPMorgan nearly tripled the amount it set aside for credit losses, to $6.66 billion, including a $1.98 billion adjustment related to how Washington Mutual accounted for loan losses.\n\nResults also included losses of $642 million on Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N preferred stock, and $248 million to buy back auction-rate securities.\n\nThe acquisition of Washington Mutual, once the largest U.S. savings and loan, gave JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon some 5,400 branches and fulfilled his longtime goal of expanding to the western United States.\n\nWith $2.25 trillion of assets, JPMorgan may have surpassed Citigroup Inc (C.N) to become the largest U.S. bank for now. Citigroup reports quarterly results on Thursday.\n\nJPMorgan said, though, that quarterly mortgage and home equity losses could top $1.5 billion early next year.

Revenue rose 5 percent to $10.38 billion, while expenses fell 3 percent.\n\nAnalysts on average expected profit of 34 cents per share on revenue of $11.08 billion. Results included $646 million of charges related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock and to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc\u2019s LEHMQ.PK bankruptcy.\n\nThe bank set aside $2.5 billion for credit losses, in large part for consumer credit losses, while net charge-offs more than doubled to $2 billion. It said home equity loan losses will be higher than normal until home prices stabilize.\n\n\u201cThe economy is weak and maybe is in a recession,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know how deep or how long it will last, but it is a good working assumption. Having said that, the steps taken by the government will help over time, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo was able to wrest Wachovia from the arms of Citigroup largely because it never dove deeply into the risky mortgages and exotic debt that strangled Wachovia, Washington Mutual and IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK.\n\nThe Wachovia merger is expected to close this quarter and create the fourth-largest U.S. bank, with more than $1.4 trillion of assets and about 6,600 branches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re known and admired for our conservative financial position and a disciplined acquisition strategy that will not change,\u201d Chief Executive John Stumpf said in a statement.\n\nSeparately, Paramus, New Jersey\u2019s Hudson City Bancorp Inc HCBK.O said third-quarter profit rose 64 percent to $121.9 million, or 25 cents per share, from $74.4 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier, as its home lending business thrived.\n\nHudson City will become the nation\u2019s largest thrift following the expected sale of Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N to Spain\u2019s Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC).

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) may emerge as long-term winners in the quake that has shaken up U.S. banks. Their staying power will be tested by their ability to complete their high-risk mergers.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s $1.9 billion purchase of Washington Mutual Inc\u2019s WAMUQ.PK banking units and Wells Fargo\u2019s planned purchase of Wachovia Corp WB.N, originally valued at $15.1 billion, add large, powerful retail branch networks to what were already two of the biggest banks in the United States.\n\nBoth purchase prices are only a small fraction of what the targets were once worth and reflected evaporating investor confidence that Wachovia and Washington Mutual would have the time and capital to combat soaring mortgage losses.\n\nWhile JPMorgan and Wells Fargo quarterly results topped forecasts on Wednesday, their continued prosperity may be at risk as the economy slides into what some expect will be a deep recession.\n\n\u201cTrying to integrate companies in the midst of a difficult operating environment is challenging, to say the least,\u201d said Chris Hagedorn, who helps invest $21.4 billion at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. \u201cThese companies have done big integrations in the past and I would give them the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan has had three large mergers in recent years: Chase Manhattan Corp\u2019s 2000 purchase of JP Morgan & Co, the 2004 purchase of Bank One Corp and May\u2019s rescue of Bear Stearns Cos. Wells Fargo has not had one since 1998, when Norwest Corp bought the old Wells Fargo and took its name.\n\nAnalysts said the success of the Washington Mutual and Wachovia takeovers depends on their acquirers\u2019 abilities to live up to their past records at merger integration and a presumption they properly assessed credit risks. JPMorgan is writing down $31 billion for Washington Mutual loans, while Wells Fargo expects to write off $74 billion from Wachovia.\n\nBut economic conditions are not good.\n\n\u201cWe necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment,\u201d JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call. He later added: \u201cIf you are not fearful, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said it is a \u201cgood working assumption\u201d that the economy is in recession.\n\n\u201cThe steps taken by the government will help over time and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he added.\n\nRichard Moroney, chief investment officer of Horizon Investment Services LLC in Hammond, Indiana, said JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are \u201ctaking on huge risks, but getting huge opportunities. It depends on how bad mortgages, car loans and credit cards are going to get. There are also integration issues: getting computers to work, getting people to work together. We\u2019ve seen those things go awry at other banks.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Wachovia itself has seen both sides of the coin.\n\nBefore buying the former Wachovia in 2001 and taking its name, First Union Corp lost thousands of customers when it botched the takeover of Philadelphia\u2019s CoreStates Financial. It also lost $2 billion when it shut down Money Store, a lender to people with poor credit histories.\n\nKen Thompson, the former chief executive of First Union and later Wachovia, at first shed that bank\u2019s reputation for poor integrations, smoothly absorbing the old Wachovia, as well as Alabama\u2019s SouthTrust Corp, a 2004 purchase.\n\nBut he shattered that progress with a $24.2 billion purchase of California mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp in October 2006, just as the housing market was about to crash. Many analysts at first thought Wachovia overpaid, although even they did not see the scope of the eventual deterioration at Golden West, once regarded as a conservative lender.\n\nWashington Mutual, meanwhile, last month became the largest U.S. bank ever to fail, following rapid expansion into subprime mortgages, home equity loans and option adjustable-rate mortgages, the latter also a Golden West specialty.\n\nJPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh told analysts the integration of Washington Mutual, acquired three weeks ago, is \u201cprogressing well.\u201d He also said Washington Mutual -- now backed by JPMorgan -- has staunched the deposit outflows that prompted regulators to seize it.\n\nMeanwhile, Atkins said a key feature of the Wachovia takeover \u201cis to combine our sales and cross-sell culture with Wachovia\u2019s service culture.\u201d Wells Fargo emphasizes selling several products to each customer, while Wachovia usually ranks near the top of independent customer satisfaction surveys.\n\n\u201cWells Fargo is a company known for going slow in integrating deals and, if it is smart, will move quickly to identify and retain much of Wachovia\u2019s key talent,\u201d wrote Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O\u2018Neill & Partners LP.",

        "body": "LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - JP Morgan said on Wednesday it is raising its price forecast for gold for 2008 and 2009 on expectations investors will buy into bullion as a haven from risk.\n\nHowever, it is trimming its expectations for platinum, palladium and silver prices on fears over falling demand for the more industrial precious metals.\n\nThe bank now sees gold prices at $904 an ounce in 2008, against a previous forecast of $884, and at $875 an ounce next year, up from $854 previously expectated.\n\n\u201cGold and silver should continue to benefit from safe-haven related interest,\u201d JP Morgan added in an emailed release.\n\nNonetheless the bank revised its silver prices lower, to $15.40 an ounce from $16.10 in 2008 and to $12.30 from $12.50 an ounce next year.\n\nIt made deeper cuts to its forecasts for platinum group metals prices. It cut its 2008 forecast for platinum by 5 percent to $1,611 an ounce, and its expected palladium price by 4 percent to $354 an ounce.\n\nFor 2009, it slashed its palladium price forecast by around a third to $225 an ounce from $338, and cut its forecast platinum price to $1,123 from $1,275.\n\nPrices of both platinum and palladium have more than halved from the highs hit earlier this year.
