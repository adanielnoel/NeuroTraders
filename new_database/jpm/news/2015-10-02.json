        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co prevailed in an $8.6 billion lawsuit brought on behalf of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc creditors who said the bank abused its power by draining Lehman of critical liquidity in its final days, precipitating the global financial crisis.\n\nIn a decision made public on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan rejected claims that JPMorgan exploited its \u201clife or death\u201d leverage as Lehman\u2019s main \u201cclearing\u201d bank to extract billions of dollars of collateral just before Lehman went bankrupt on Sept. 15, 2008.\n\nCreditors said JPMorgan had no need for this despite volatile markets and extracted a windfall at their expense.\n\nBut the judge said JPMorgan was entitled to demand collateral to secure Lehman\u2019s obligations and did not defraud Lehman into providing it. He also said JPMorgan had no contractual obligation to extend credit to keep Lehman alive.\n\n\u201cThat plaintiffs are now dissatisfied with the bargain they struck and believe that (JPMorgan) behaved badly in enforcing its terms is of no moment,\u201d Sullivan wrote.\n\n\u201cThe court will not now rewrite the parties\u2019 contractual text - with express or implied terms - to provide Lehman with language more beneficial than what it negotiated,\u201d he added.\n\nLawyers for Lehman creditors and Lehman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nJPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the New York-based bank is pleased with the decision\n\nSullivan ruled 3-1/2 years after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck allowed the $8.6 billion lawsuit to proceed. Peck oversaw Lehman\u2019s Chapter 11 proceedings at the time.\n\nThe fight with JPMorgan is one of the last major pieces of litigation arising from Lehman\u2019s demise.\n\nOnce Wall Street\u2019s fourth-largest bank, Lehman reported $639 billion of assets when it went bankrupt, making its bankruptcy six times larger than any other in U.S. history.\n\nUnsecured creditors were to have recouped $105.4 billion on their claims, including a scheduled Oct. 1 distribution, Lehman said last week. Much of Lehman\u2019s brokerage unit was sold to Barclays Plc after the Chapter 11 filing.\n\nIn his decision, Sullivan also said it was premature to decide whether to pay JPMorgan later than other Lehman creditors on some claims because of its alleged \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cunconscionable\u201d actions.\n\nThe case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc et al v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06760.",
