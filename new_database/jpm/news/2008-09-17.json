        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve intervened aggressively to shore up the U.S. financial system this week, providing at least $87 billion to help underpin trades with units of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, court documents show.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s action is the latest sign of how U.S. authorities have been seeking to prop up financial markets following the failure of Lehman LEH.P and as big insurer American International Group (AIG.N) fights for survival.\n\nWhile the government had pledged not to fund a rescue of Lehman, the disclosure on Tuesday showed that authorities were taking other financial steps to prevent markets from descending into chaos.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) advanced $87 billion to the units on Monday to help clear and facilitate securities transactions with customers and clients of Lehman \u201cto avoid disruption of financial markets,\u201d according to documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nLehman and the New York Fed had requested the advance, known as a \u201ccommencement date advance\u201d and the New York Fed repaid it, according to filings.\n\nIn effect, the New York Fed lent the funds to the units.\n\nA representative for the New York Fed declined to comment.\n\n\u201cThis expansion of the Fed\u2019s credit program is unprecedented,\u201d said David Pauker, a managing director with restructuring adviser Goldin Associates.\n\n\u201cIt should provide the liquidity necessary to facilitate the sale of Lehman\u2019s core brokerage and banking business.\u201d\n\nIn court on Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said he would provide a \u201ccomfort order\u201d for JPMorgan, allowing it to continue providing the advances to Lehman.\n\nHarold Novikoff, a lawyer for JPMorgan, told the court that the firm has regularly provided these advances for Lehman to facilitate its trading, but was typically paid back by other parties who would step in overnight to repay JPMorgan. However, some of those third parties have disappeared since Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, filing necessitating the intervention from the Fed.\n\nA representative for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in court that services provided by JPMorgan were \u201cintegral\u201d to the market.\n\n\u201cIf we stop, the broker dealer stops. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Novikoff told reporters after the hearing.\n\nLehman had provided JPMorgan with $17 billion in collateral for the advancing services prior to the bankruptcy filing, Lehman\u2019s lawyer Shai Weisman told the court.\n\nThe sale of Lehman\u2019s broker-dealer business appeared closer on Tuesday, as a source said Britain\u2019s Barclays (BARC.L) had agreed to buy Lehman\u2019s core broker-dealer business for about $2 billion.\n\nLehman\u2019s holding company filed for bankruptcy in the early hours of Monday, in the largest U.S. bankruptcy ever.\n\nAlthough Lehman\u2019s broker-dealer units are not covered under the filing, customers typically unwind trades with a dealer whose holding company is bankrupt.\n\nOn Tuesday, at the request of Lehman and the New York Fed, JPMorgan advanced $51 billion to Lehman as part of a so-called second-day advance.\n\nCourt documents did not specify whether the New York Fed would repay the second amount.\n\nJPMorgan may elect to advance additional money to Lehman units as part of a \u201cpost-petition advance.\u201d\n\nAll post-petition advances are guaranteed by Lehman and collateralized, according to the documents.\n\n\u201cThe Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is taking the restructuring industry into uncharted waters,\u201d Pauker said.",

        "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hanwha Group has hired investment bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) to sell a 9.9 percent stake in its Korea Life insurance unit, sources said on Wednesday, in a deal that could value the unit at more than $7.5 billion.\n\nAffinity Equity, Carlyle Group and MBK Partners are among several private equity firms interested in the stake, which is targeting $500 million to $750 million from foreign investors, sources with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters.\n\nHanwha has previously laid out plans to publicly list the life insurance company. A minority stake from a foreign investor would not only help give Korea Life a pre-IPO valuation, but would raise cash for Hanwha\u2019s bid for a stake in Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (042660.KS).\n\nThe Daewoo Shipbuilding deal is expected to fetch up to $8 billion. Hanwha\u2019s ability to finance a bid is seen as relatively weak compared to its rivals.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a firm plan for such a deal yet,\u201d Ju Cheol-beom, a Hanwha Group spokesman, said, referring to the Korea Life stake sale.\n\nBut sources involved in the process said that private equity firms are already poring over bid-related documents in an auction that will likely kick off in the next couple of weeks.\n\nSo far, the process has focused on foreign private equity firms because the size of the stake on offer. A more than $500 million equity check would fit well with the kind of cash big buyout firms are willing to pay in Asia.\n\nWith financing markets hit by the deepening global credit crunch, a private equity firm would probably have to pay all cash for a Korea Life stake.\n\nThat is something private equity firms are typically loathe to do, but finding big-ticket deals in Asia with strong growth prospects is something major private equity players are struggling with.\n\nAffinity, an Asia focused private equity firm, has a successful track record in South Korea. It was among the investors that bought South Korean electronics chain Hi-Mart in 2005 for $833 million, which later sold for more than $2 billion.\n\nCarlyle Group has a long standing presence in Asia, and has invested in the insurance sector in the region before.\n\nMBK Partners, founded by a former Carlyle member, is a South Korea-based private equity firm, with investments in three domestic companies according to its website.\n\nThe three are among the firms interested in the Korea Life stake, sources said.\n\nCarlyle and JPMorgan declined to comment. Affinity and MBK did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nConglomerate Hanwha Group said last month it had cleared all hurdles to the Korea Life IPO after the insurance company cleaned up accumulated losses as the end of April, adding that it would kick off the offering process as soon as possible.\n\nHanwha Group, led by chemical and trading company Hanwha Corp (000880.KS), runs businesses ranging from construction to petrochemical production (009830.KS) and stockbroking",
