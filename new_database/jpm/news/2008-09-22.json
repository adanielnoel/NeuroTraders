Given outperformance, we think it prudent to take profits,\u201d he added.\n\nWorthington expects the challenging market to impact trading volume and potentially net interest spreads, as interest rates are expected to remain low and could also fall further.\n\nShares of Penson closed at $15.60 Friday on Nasdaq. Shares of Pzena closed at $12.40 the same day on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Adheesha Sarkar in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Investors should sell U.S. mid-sized regional banks\u2019 shares and take profits as these stocks may only have an indirect benefit from the U.S. government\u2019s rescue plan for troubled banks, a J.P. Morgan Securities analyst said.\n\nU.S. authorities have proposed a $700 billion bailout plan, which will help troubled banks to offload hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debt from their balance sheets.\n\nHowever, analyst Steven Alexopoulos said once the temporary ban on short selling financials is lifted, a better buying opportunity will likely be created.\n\nBanks with residential construction portfolios in Nevada, Arizona and Florida will see near-term benefits of the Treasury\u2019s plan as there is pent up demand for real estate given an inability of potential borrowers to secure credit, Alexopoulos wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAlexopoulos believes the Treasury\u2019s plan, which will reintroduce liquidity into the banking system and mortgage market, could set the platform for an eventual recovery of the housing market.\n\n\u201cAny improvement in the ability of homebuilders to sell homes means cash flow to repay debt,\u201d Alexopoulos said.\n\nAlexopoulos sees Synovus Financial and Colonial BancGroup as the prime beneficiaries of the Treasury\u2019s plan, but said he was incrementally more cautious on the quality of home equity loans and remained \u201cunderweight\u201d on TCF Financial.\n\nShares of regional banks had rallied on Friday as government\u2019s efforts, including temporary ban on short selling and the rescue plan, to restore stability in the financial markets was cheered by investors.\n\nThe KBW Regional Banking index, which closed up 5 percent at 87.27 on Friday, was down 8 percent at 80.0 Monday morning.",

        "body": "Sept 22 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said it saw too many risks for the U.S. chicken industry and cited concerns about a slowdown in domestic demand, while initiating coverage of three chicken producers, including Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N).\n\nAnalyst Ken Goldman started Tyson, the largest U.S. meat producer, with an \u201coverweight\u201d rating. He initiated smaller rivals Sanderson Farms Inc (SAFM.O), the No. 4 U.S. chicken producer, with an \u201cunderweight\u201d rating and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp PPC.N, the No. 1 chicken producer, with \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\nThe analyst said he expects chicken exports to suffer if the dollar strengthens and if Russia limits chicken imports.\n\n\u201cWe wonder not only whether production cuts will be sustained but also if they are sufficient to drive margins back to historical norms,\u201d Goldman wrote in a note to clients.\n\nRussia is the biggest market for U.S. poultry exporters. The United States last year exported nearly $1 billion worth of poultry, mainly frozen chicken leg quarters, and other meat products to Russia.\n\nGoldman said he was more pessimistic about Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s near-term fundamentals than Tyson\u2019s as the latter is less tethered to chicken, relative to its peers, and has large, profitable pork and beef businesses.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s Pride, however, has a solid business model and is poised for continued growth in the longer-term, he added.\n\nGoldman expects Sanderson Farms to be hurt, more than Pilgrim\u2019s or Tyson, by the risks surrounding the chicken industry. About 25 percent of Sanderson\u2019s exports go to Russia, he noted.\n\n\u201cIf Russia follows through on its threats to cut chicken imports from the U.S., Sanderson would have to find new homes for a larger percent of meat than its peers,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldman expects Tyson to earn 41 cents a share in the fourth quarter. He forecast a loss of 56 cents a share for Pilgrim\u2019s Pride and a loss of 34 cents a share for Sanderson during the quarter.

It had risen 28.2 percent on Thursday and Friday combined, as the government announced a series of measures to calm financial markets and stabilize lenders, now including plans to buy as much as $700 billion of troubled assets.\n\n\u201cThe sector got the adrenaline shot last week, and that\u2019s wearing off,\u201d said Michael Nix, who helps invest $750 million at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South Carolina. \u201cThe near-term outlook for financials still remains pretty difficult.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan, Wachovia and Wells Fargo are respectively the third-, fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. banks by assets. Shares of larger banks Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) also fell as the broader market tanked.\n\nWachovia shares declined after Morgan Stanley won U.S. Federal Reserve approval to become a bank holding company, boosting its ability to attract deposits. Morgan Stanley also agreed to sell a possible $8.5 billion stake to Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T).\n\nBoth moves increased the Wall Street bank\u2019s perceived ability to survive independently, without merging with a lender with a more stable funding base.\n\nWachovia Chief Executive Robert Steel is trying to shed non-core assets, cut 11,350 jobs and reduce annual costs by $1.5 billion as the bank manages a \u201cdistressed\u201d $122 billion portfolio of option adjustable-rate mortgages. Even so, Wachovia shares more than doubled on Thursday and Friday.\n\nNix said not merging with Morgan Stanley could even be positive for Wachovia. \u201cIt will allow Robert Steel to focus on Wachovia and fix the franchise, without having to integrate a significant merger at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nWachovia was also downgraded to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d by Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Christopher Mutascio, who called the bank\u2019s recent share run-up \u201ctoo much too soon.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were downgraded by Sandler O\u2018Neill & Partners LP analysts, who said their stock valuations already reflected the banks\u2019 positions as among the best-run and best-performing large banks in a tough credit environment.\n\nAnalyst Jeff Harte downgraded JPMorgan to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy,\u201d while Scott Siefers cut Wells Fargo to \u201csell\u201d from \u201chold.\u201d Wells Fargo shares had hit a record high on Friday.\n\nWachovia is based in Charlotte, North Carolina; JPMorgan in New York, and Wells Fargo in San Francisco.",
