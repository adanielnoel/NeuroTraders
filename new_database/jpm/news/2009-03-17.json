It leaves on a horse but comes back on foot,\u201d said Kathleen Hughes, head of global liquidity EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nShe told the Reuters Fund Summit in Luxembourg on Tuesday that her firm\u2019s money market funds had seen a 125 percent increase in investment flows between summer 2007 and the end of 2008.\n\nIt outstripped the industry\u2019s 29 percent growth, she said, and included some $85 billion alone in 2008\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nMuch of this was due to investors fleeing falling equity markets and other assets being hit by what is being dubbed \u201cThe Great Recession.\u201d\n\nHughes said there were now some signs that investors were moving away from the most conservative areas. Within her money markets funds, for example, demand for short-dated U.S. Treasuries and other government-guaranteed paper had fallen off.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury fund is nearly half the size that it was,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cYou might be able to take that as a sign.\u201d\n\nDemand for such investments -- very short-term guaranteed paper, not to confused with longer-dated bonds -- had been so great that JPMorgan Asset Management actually closed its Treasury money market segment to new investment for a while. There was too much demand for too little supply.\n\n\u201cThey were being hoarded,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the segment has now been reopened as demand dropped off.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury fund hit its peak the same time that Libor (did),\u201d she said, referring to the London Interbank Offered Rate.\n\nThat rate, which reflects among other things banks\u2019 trust in each other to repay short-term loans, shot higher last year but has since dropped well back as central banks have cut interest rates and pumped money into the financial system.\n\n\u201cClearly it was a difficult situation when trust had completely broken down and banks had stopped lending to each other,\u201d Hughes said\n\nShe added that it was a healthy trend that Libor had now come down, \u201cBut you never want to forget about it.\u201d",
