There have been only two initial public offerings (IPOs) so far in 2017 in the UAE, raising $348.5 million, and none at all last year, Thomson Reuters data shows.\n\nOther oil companies looking to raise money from listings of retail units include China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, which is planning to list its retail unit in Hong Kong and Thailand\u2019s biggest energy company PTT which is examining a proposal to list its retail business.\n\nThe pitching process for the ADNOC deal is under way after the unlisted group announced this week that it is looking to float some of its services businesses and enter tie-ups with global investors to help it create new revenue streams and secure more market access.\n\nTen banks have been invited to pitch for a role in the IPO, one of the sources said. ADNOC declined to confirm details of the pitching process, but a spokesman told Reuters \u201ccentral to ADNOC\u2019s new approach is the more active management of its portfolio of assets and businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cADNOC is therefore considering the IPO of minority stakes of some of its services businesses and we will update the market on its plans in due course,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nSpokespeople for JPMorgan, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Rothschild declined to comment. First Abu Dhabi Bank did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nADNOC has no plans to list the holding company. State-owned ADNOC produces around 3 million barrels of oil per day and manages 95 percent of UAE\u2019s proven oil reserves and 92 percent of the country\u2019s gas reserves.",
