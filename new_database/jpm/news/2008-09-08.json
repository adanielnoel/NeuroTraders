        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks recouped $20 billion on mortgage securities holdings in Monday\u2019s sweeping MBS rally after the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the day before, a JPMorgan analyst said.\n\n\u201cBanks just made about $20 billion on their available for-sale portfolios this morning,\u201d Matthew Jozoff, head of mortgage strategy at JPMorgan, said on a conference call. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll use that gain to add to their capital base or even start rotating into some of the sectors that had lagged.\u201d\n\nAvailable for sale refers to securities that a company is trying to sell rather than hold.\n\nRisk premiums on mortgage bonds issued by the troubled mortgage financiers have been slashed by as much as 40 basis points over Treasuries on Monday, Jozoff said.\n\n\u201cBanks had been a little over $40 billion under water relative to their book costs for securities overall and with today\u2019s move and the tightening in mortgages, we estimate that helps bring that to only about $20 billion under water,\u201d Jozoff said.\n\n\u201cThis could be an opportunity for banks to basically recycle and move out of agency securities and potentially move into other products as well,\u201d he said.\n\nFinancial firms overall have posted over $500 billion in credit losses and write-downs since credit markets seized up a year ago after defaults on U.S. home loans.",
