        "body": "(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) reported lower-than-estimated third-quarter profit on Tuesday as unexpected legal expenses of $1 billion caught analysts off guard and offset strength in its capital markets and lending businesses.\n\nThe bulk of the costs came from setting aside money to resolve government probes into alleged rigging of foreign-exchange rates, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said.\n\nJPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, also reported higher-than-expected operating costs, with compensation, technology and marketing all up. Lake cited strong business growth, and added that JPMorgan may breach its annual expense target of $58 billion this year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses,\u201d she said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nJPMorgan and other big banks have been trying to bolster profits through cost-cutting for years, as low interest rates and new regulations have crimped revenue growth. But the efforts have been overshadowed by multibillion-dollar fines and higher costs for technology and compliance.\n\nA year ago, JPMorgan reported its first loss since 2004 due to $7.2 billion in litigation expenses. Overall, the bank agreed to pay nearly $20 billion in 2013 to settle various legal issues. Yet other matters, like the foreign-exchange probes, remain unresolved.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing high level of litigation expense after last year\u2019s ... mega settlement is a bit disturbing,\u201d said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. \u201cAt some point, it ceases to become a \u2018special\u2019 item.\u201d\n\nOverall, JPMorgan reported earnings of $5.6 billion, or $1.36 per share, compared with a loss of $380 million a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of $1.38 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nRevenue rose 5 percent to $24.2 billion from $23.1 billion in the third quarter of 2013.\n\nJPMorgan was hit with a technical glitch on Tuesday as its earnings release appeared hours ahead of schedule due to a \u201chuman error\u201d at a vendor that handles its investor relations documents.\n\nThe earnings report was the first since Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, underwent radiation and chemotherapy for throat cancer. The illness has raised questions about who might succeed him if he steps down.\n\nDimon said his prognosis remained \u201cexcellent,\u201d allowing him to maintain a busier schedule, but added that he was still monitoring his health with regular doctor visits.\n\nDimon told reporters on a conference call that the bank was seeing \u201ca broad-based recovery\u201d in the United States, both in consumer and corporate markets.\n\nA recent uptick in volatility helped JPMorgan\u2019s trading business, but Dimon said products that deliver more stable earnings in the retail bank were not affected by brief market swings.\n\nRevenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity trading rose 2.1 percent to $3.51 billion in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier.\n\nTotal investment banking revenue rose 2 percent to $1.54 billion, driven by higher advisory fees. But net income from mortgage banking fell 38 percent $439 million.\n\n\u201cThe headline numbers have come out slightly below expectations, but the model of stability is there, and that\u2019s ultimately what you want from a bank,\u201d said Simon Maughan, head of research at financial analysis firm OTAS Technologies in London.",

Below are other examples of technical glitches and broken embargoes that led to quarterly results being published earlier than expected:\n\n** Oct. 15, 2013 - Citigroup Inc\u2019s (C.N) third-quarter results were released early as Bloomberg News broke an embargo, forcing the bank to pull forward the release of its statement.\n\n** Oct. 18, 2012 - Google Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) third-quarter results released ahead of schedule, showing lower-than-expected earnings, plunging its shares by as much as 10.5 percent. The Internet giant blamed its filing agent R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co RRD.O for putting out an early draft.\n\nThe second paragraph of the statement said \u201cPENDING LARRY QUOTE\u201d instead of an actual quote from Google CEO Larry Page. Within minutes, an unknown prankster set up a \u201cPendingLarry\u201d Twitter feed to hypothesize what the missing quote might be.\n\n** April 20, 2012 - MetLife Inc (MET.N) found that its first-quarter results could be accessed from a historical results financial supplement on its website. The results, scheduled to be released on May 2, were embedded in the supplement but were not meant to be visible. The insurer then advanced its release date to April 26.\n\n** Jan. 27, 2011 - Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) second-quarter earnings were obtained from its website more than an hour before their scheduled release by a New Jersey-based market-information company, Selerity Inc.\n\n** Nov. 17, 2010 - NetApp Inc\u2019s (NTAP.O) second-quarter results leaked after Bloomberg retrieved unpublished financial data from a restricted area of the company\u2019s website more than an hour before the scheduled release. \u201cWe found the release posted on the company\u2019s website without any required password or firewall,\u201d Bloomberg News said.\n\n** Nov. 11, 2010 - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) inadvertently released its fourth-quarter results before the closing bell. Disney\u2019s stock ended down 3 percent that day, spooking some investors.",
