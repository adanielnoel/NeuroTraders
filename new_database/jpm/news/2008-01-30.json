SocGen\u2019s losses, blamed mostly on bad bets on European equity index futures, had been a big lesson, Ulrich added.\n\nA desire to control risk was also the main reason why a landmark scheme that would permit Chinese residents to invest directly in Hong Kong was likely to remain on ice.\n\nChina\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced the programme, dubbed the through train, on July 20. But other agencies raised objections and Premier Wen Jiabao eventually put it on hold pending a review.\n\n\u201cI think the chances of the through train happening at this juncture are very low,\u201d Ulrich said.\n\nShe said the government was very keen to shield small savers from the risks the scheme entails, especially in the current turbulent environment of rising investment risk.\n\n\u201cEven if the through train programme is announced some time in 2008, it\u2019s going to be on a very limited scale,\u201d she added. Ulrich still expects Chinese investors to send $90 billion of capital overseas in 2008 by buying mutual funds and other products offered by banks, insurers and asset managers under China\u2019s Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme.
