        "body": "(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said it expects the \u201cgreat recession\u201d of 2008 to end by the second half of 2009 and views discretionary and financials as drivers of earnings growth in the next year.\n\nInvestors are likely to approach 2009 with a more bullish tilt given the expected continuation of the December rally, JP Morgan\u2019s chief U.S. strategist Thomas Lee wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cWith the record cash on sidelines, positive expectations from an Obama administration, and a potential mid-2009 economic recovery, we see investors buying stocks in early 2009,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAn economic recovery will spur risk appetite, reversing extreme risk aversion, he added.\n\nFinancials and discretionary are expected to have incrementally better fundamentals relative to the S&P 500, according to the strategist, while resources and exporters are seen reversing to earnings drag from drivers in 2009.\n\nThe brokerage believes the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s actions, lower gasoline prices, lower mortgage rates, $700 billion to $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus, and a possible auto sales recovery in the second half of 2009 will almost certainly do something for the economy.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest economy has been hit from rising loan defaults and foreclosures in the face of reduced consumer spending and poor liquidity in the credit markets.\n\nThe strategist called the 2008 recession \u201dchallenging,\u201c and said \u201dwe believe the greatest policy mistake in 2008 was allowing Lehman Brothers to fail.\n\nA further failure in a financial company is less likely now that policy makers see the importance of the \u201clender of last resort\u201d function, Lee said.\n\nSome potential areas of further weakness are a large industrial company failure, a large, tentacled hedge fund failure, a large foreign company defaulting, or even a large emerging market nation, the strategist added.\n\nSeveral financial companies have had to file for bankruptcy or seek government aid as they struggle to keep themselves afloat amid the financial crisis.\n\nLee, however, forecast 2009 to be an earnings trough for the S&P 500, with a strong rebound seen in 2010.\n\nHe said any equity rally over the next few months is likely to fail unless it is confirmed by a broad improvement in the credit market.",
