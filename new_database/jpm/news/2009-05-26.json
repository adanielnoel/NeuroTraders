The program, under which investors obtain Fed financing for the debt, was limited to \u201cAAA\u201d rated bonds.\n\n\u201dIt is fairly remarkable to us that S&P\u2019s announcement would be released one week after terms for TALF for legacy CMBS were released, especially given the fairly extensive lead time a methodology change like this requires, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note.\n\nS&P said the revisions as planned could also lead it to cut ratings on about 25 percent and 60 percent of the most-senior parts of CMBS issued in 2005 and 2006, respectively.\n\nJPMorgan said it appears that a bond downgraded from \u201cAAA\u201d would be ineligible for TALF, but noted the Fed could modify rules to include CMBS that initially carried the top rating.\n\nThe analysts said the Fed\u2019s efforts to restart lending in the commercial real estate market could be at risk.\n\n\u201cUltimately, in the unlikely case in which investors\u2019 confidence fades, liquidity abates and investors begin to \u2018panic\u2019 sell, TALF for new issue CMBS would suffer as well,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nS&P said it will issue a follow-up report after evaluating the impact of its proposed changes on all CMBS.
