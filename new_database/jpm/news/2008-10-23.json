        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase Bank on Thursday accused a New York recruitment agency in a lawsuit of helping Citadel Investment Group LLC entice executives to leave the financial institution.\n\nThe lawsuit said that The IDW Group LLC broke its contract with JPMorgan to provide management and executive search services. The breach of contract included solicitation of Patrik Edsparr, \u201cone of JPMorgan\u2019s most senior and valued executives on Citadel\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nFiled in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the lawsuit said IDW \u201cdirectly or indirectly solicited, induced, recruited and enticed multiple JPMorgan employees to leave JPMorgan for positions elsewhere including at Citadel.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of neither IDW nor Citadel could immediately be reached for comment.\n\nEdsparr, who was global head of rates, foreign exchange, securitized products, fixed-income exotics and hybrids, among other responsibilities, resigned from JPMorgan in March for Citadel. The executive had reported directly to Steve Black, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank, the complaint said.\n\nIt said from January through March this year, IDW arranged several meetings between the executive and Citadel\u2019s senior management, including President and CEO Ken Griffin.\n\n\u201cOn information and belief, IDW encouraged Edsparr to accept an offer to become a highly compensated employee of Citadel,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nEdsparr now serves as Citadel\u2019s CEO for Europe and head of global fixed income business.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s complaint said that after Edsparr left, between April 22 and July 11, five more employees within the investment bank -- Derek Kaufman, William King, Jorge Picazo, John Niccolai and John Naud -- resigned to join Citadel.\n\nJPMorgan accused IDW of repeatedly breaching its obligations under four agreements signed between the two firms in 2007 and is seeking damages in a trial by jury.\n\nIt is also asking the court to prevent the agency from using or disclosing confidential, proprietary and personal information and ordering any such information to be returned to JPMorgan.",
