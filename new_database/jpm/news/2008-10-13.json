        "body": "Oct 13 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities cut Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (DO.N) to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d and said shares of the oil and gas drilling contractor was overvalued relative to its group.\n\nThe rating change is in view of a rebound in the group, a long grind sideways and rapid deterioration of dayrates to, or below, midcycle levels, the brokerage said.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect positive deepwater rates in the near term, we have cut 2009 and 2010 earnings estimates given E&P (exploration and production) budget risk,\u201d JP Morgan analyst David Smith said in a note to clients.\n\nWhile the analyst expects a strong rebound in the services names should the markets stabilize, he said Diamond Offshore presented less upside in a rebound versus its peers.\n\nOffshore driller stocks largely discount a rapid return to, or below, midcycle rates. Under this scenario, Diamond Offshore has the most margin to lose, particularly if deepwater newbuilds arrive into a market that is cutting deepwater exploration budgets, Smith said.\n\nSmith said even if oil prices find support at $80 barrel and the offshore drillers avoid significant earnings deterioration, the company would still look expensive, adding that it was more business than credit risk for Diamond Offshore.\n\nThe analyst said he preferred shares of companies like Transocean Inc (RIG.N) and Pride International Inc PDE.N which have better backlog support and improving fleets at a cheaper price, and Noble Corp (NE.N), Rowan Companies Inc (RDC.N) which present more upside in a rebound and little liquidity risk.\n\nDiamond Offshore shares were up 9 percent at $72.59 in morning trade amid a broader market rally. The shares touched a high of $74.23 in early trade Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones U.S. oil equipment and services index .DJUSOI was up 5 percent at 388.25.
