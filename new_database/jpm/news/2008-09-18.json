        "body": "(Reuters) - A U.S. Senate subcommittee told JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) on Wednesday to immediately start turning over a year\u2019s worth of internal documents about the bank\u2019s view on oil prices, The New York Times said citing a letter.\n\nThe move came after the subcommittee obtained a private message in which an investment officer seemed to contradict testimony other bank executives gave to the Senate this week, the paper said.\n\nA JP Morgan Chase spokesman told the paper the bank would \u201crespond appropriately\u201d to the demand.\n\nJP Morgan Chase could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters on Thursday.\n\nThe New York Times said the letter was sent to JP Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota and the chairman of the Senate Energy subcommittee, which held a hearing on Tuesday on the role of speculators in moving oil prices.\n\nLawrence Eagles, who joined the bank as head of global commodity research recently after several years as the head of the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) markets division, told the hearing the bank believed high energy prices are fundamentally the result of supply and demand, not speculation, the NYT said.\n\nHowever on Wednesday, Senator Dorgan released what he said was a contradictory e-mail message sent to banking clients on Tuesday by the bank\u2019s global chief investment officer, Michael Cembalest, the paper said.\n\nThat message blamed \u201can enormous amount of speculation pent up in energy markets,\u201d for the high price and added, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the supply-demand equation.\u201d\n\nSenator Dorgan asked Dimon for an explanation in the letter, according to the paper.",
