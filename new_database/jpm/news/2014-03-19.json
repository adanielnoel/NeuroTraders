        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. has sold its physical commodities arm to Mercuria for $3.5 billion in cash, catapulting the Swiss trade house into the top tier of commodities traders.\n\nWhile parts of JPMorgan\u2019s commodities business have passed through the hands of some of the most well-known names in the raw materials markets, its core is comprised of two enterprises considered among the most successful of their time: Sempra Commodities and Bear Stearns\u2019 power and gas desk.\n\nBut major parts of the JPMorgan business were extracted from the ashes of failure, including a base metals operation that endured through the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Enron meltdown, and a trading platform that dates back to the days of failed investment bank Drexel Burnham.\n\nMore recently, much of the business had already been bought and sold twice in the past five years, once when Royal Bank of Scotland bought a 51 percent stake in Sempra Commodities and then again when RBS was forced to sell it to JPMorgan.\n\nA partial history of the business is below:\n\n1980s - Drexel Burnham Lambert expands into physical energy trading, hiring a team that includes future Sempra chiefs David Messer and Frank Gallipoli.\n\n1986 - UK-based warehousing group Henry Bath & Sons is taken over by Metallgesellschaft (MG), a huge German conglomerate and one of the world's largest physical and futures metal traders, according to a history on its website. r.reuters.com/myk56v\n\nEarly 1990 - AIG acquires the commodity trading business of Drexel Burnham, which had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n1997 - Pacific Enterprises and Enova Corp acquire the energy unit of AIG Trading for $225 million.

The deal includes leases to several million barrels of oil storage in Canada.\n\n2004 - Sempra Energy Trading is renamed Sempra Commodities. By 2005, the unit contributes more than half of parent company Sempra\u2019s net income; makes over half a billion dollars in 2007.\n\nSeptember 2005 - Bear Stearns moves into energy trading through a joint-venture with Calpine. Deal ends six months later, but Bear Stearns continues to expand in the power and gas markets.\n\nNovember 2006 - Bear Stearns buys Delta Power Co., a private power-plant developer with 1,380 megawatts of capacity.\n\nMay 2007 - Bear Stearns\u2019 commodity arm buys the electricity trading book, and gas and power contracts of Williams Cos for $512 million, giving it about 7,700 MW of gas-fired tolling capacity and 1,800 MW of full-requirements power supply.\n\nEarly 2008 - JPMorgan buys carbon offsetting company ClimateCare.

        "body": "BOGOTA, March 19 (Reuters) - Colombia\u2019s peso staged its strongest rally in six months after investment bank J.P. Morgan announced on Wednesday it will boost the weighting of the country\u2019s peso-denominated debt in two closely followed emerging market bond indexes.\n\nIn a note circulated to investors, J.P. Morgan said it will introduce five new Colombian Treasury bonds, known as TES, in its GBI-EM Global Diversified and GBI-EM Global indexes.\n\nThe new instruments - maturing in 2016, 2018, 2022, 2024 and 2028 - will be included in a phased approach over five month-end periods, starting on May 30 and ending on Sept. 30, it said.\n\nGenerally, an increased weighting of a country in major indexes leads to more investment in that nation\u2019s securities since investment fund managers are often judged against the benchmarks.\n\n\u201cCOP (the Colombian peso) and TES bonds staged a huge rally after (the J.P. Morgan) announcement,\u201d Citibank said in a note. \u201cThe weight increase should generate very significant inflows into TES bonds. \u201d\n\nColombia\u2019s peso strengthened 1.17 percent on Wednesday to 2007 to the dollar while public debt appreciated across the entire maturity curve. It was the peso\u2019s strongest appreciation since Sept. 19 last year.\n\nIn announcing the move to boost Colombia\u2019s weighting in the indexes, J.P. Morgan cited \u201cimproved transparency and accessibility for international investors in the local TES market.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the bank said Colombia\u2019s participation in J.P. Morgan\u2019s GBI-EM Global Diversified index will rise to 8 percent up from 3.2 percent previously and in the GBI-EM Global, it will increase to 5.6 percent from 1.8 percent\n\nOn March 3, the director of public credit, Michel Janna, told Reuters in an interview that the country was preparing reforms to boost sales of its debt to foreign investors.\n\nJanna was referring to the need to make an even deeper cut to the tax foreigners pay on earnings from debt investments even after it was slashed to 14 percent from the start of 2013, down from 33 percent previously.\n\nThat cut raised the proportion of Colombia\u2019s debt in foreign hands to around 7 percent up from 2 percent in 2012, still a comparatively low figure for the region, Janna said. He added foreign ownership of Mexican and Peruvian debt is between 40 and 50 percent.\n\nJanna considers 15 to 20 percent a desirable level of foreign ownership of the country\u2019s public debt.\n\nColombia\u2019s increased weighting may come at the expense of the that of Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hungary, the announcement from the bank warned.\n\nThe TES bonds that will be introduced in the bank\u2019s indexes expire on June 2016, November 2018, May 2022, July 2024 and April 2028.

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) is selling its physical commodities business to Mercuria for $3.5 billion, the U.S. bank said on Wednesday, sweeping the fast-growing Swiss trading house into the top league of commodities traders.\n\nThe all-cash transaction for one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street is expected to close in the third quarter, JPMorgan said in a statement.\n\nIn documents circulated to potential buyers last year, JPMorgan had valued its physical commodity business at $3.3 billion, with an annual income of $750 million. JPMorgan paid nearly $2 billion to buy the largest part of the business from RBS in 2010.\n\nJPMorgan decided to sell its multibillion-dollar physical commodities division last year because of rising regulatory and political pressure, and so it could concentrate on the bank\u2019s core business of lending.\n\n\u201cOur goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was interested in preserving the value of JPMorgan\u2019s physical business,\u201d said Blythe Masters, head of JPMorgan\u2019s global commodities business.\n\nJPMorgan said it would still provide traditional banking activities in commodities markets, including financial products and the vaulting and trading of precious metals.\n\nIt gave no further details of what exactly would be included in the transaction, but a source close to the matter said the bank\u2019s metal brokerage business including its London Metal Exchange (LME) ring dealing team would remain with JPMorgan.\n\nHowever its Henry Bath metals warehousing unit was included in the deal, the source added.\n\nJPMorgan also has sizeable power, natural gas and carbon trading desks, largely operating from London, as well as owning power plants.\n\nThe fate of JPMorgan\u2019s Masters was too early to tell, the source said, adding that she and her management team had been primarily focused on achieving the sale.\n\nOthers in the commodities units were waiting to hear about their future.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether Mercuria will want to keep us on or not, and whether they will attempt to move our desks to Geneva,\u201d one trader with the bank said.\n\n\u201cMost of us want to stay here (in London), so I suspect a drive to move us to Geneva would equate to a reduction of our power and gas trading desks,\u201d the trader added.\n\nMany other banks, including Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Barclays (BARC.L), have recently scaled back or shut down their power, gas and carbon trading desks, citing unfavorable banking regulation as the main reason.\n\nIn February, Reuters reported that Mercuria, led by two former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) executives Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, became the front-runner to buy the physical commodities unit, one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street.\n\nThe bank went into exclusive talks with Mercuria in February. In the weeks before that, the trade house had been competing with Australian bank Macquarie Group (MQG.AX) and private equity manager Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to buy JPMorgan\u2019s unit, sources had said.\n\nPrivate and lightly regulated trading houses have benefited most from a major retreat by banks from commodities trading over the past two years.\n\nCompanies such as Glencore (GLEN.L) and Russian oil major Rosneft hired whole teams of traders from banks such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N) but Mercuria will become the first trading house to absorb an entire physical division from a bank.\n\nFollowing the news on Wednesday, Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, who has been a staunch critic of Wall Street\u2019s physical commodity activities, renewed his call for U.S. regulators to clamp down on banks\u2019 ownership of metals warehouses, oil pipelines and other commodity assets.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s news is a welcome development, but this does not let regulators off the hook,\u201d Brown said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Fed, CFTC, and others must enact robust reforms to Wall Street\u2019s physical commodities activities and do more to protect end users and consumers of aluminum and other materials.\u201d",
