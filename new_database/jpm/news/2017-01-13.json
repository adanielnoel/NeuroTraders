A stagnant economy in Argentina, escalating political tension in Brazil and the impact of new U.S. government on Mexico could make bank bonds in those countries more vulnerable to bouts of volatility.\n\n\u201cGiven the balance of risks, our focus is on higher-yielding instruments with enough carry to offset possible price declines,\u201d Corfield wrote.\n\nHer remarks underscore how Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. presidential victory in November has shaken confidence in some Latin American countries and how governments and companies in the region have to advance their own agenda to lure investors back.\n\nArgentina President Mauricio Macri is struggling to revamp an economy long hobbled by years of high inflation and weak investment, while Brazilian President Michel Temer is wrestling with the country\u2019s worst recession ever and fallout from a massive corruption scandal that helped topple his predecessor.\n\nTrump has pledged to curtail financial flows to and renegotiate trade deals with Mexico, which derives most export proceeds from sales to the United States.\n\nGovernments and companies in Latin America may halve global bond sales this year, reflecting the success of prior refinancing efforts and uncertainty about Trump\u2019s views on the region. Regional offerings could fall to as low as $60 billion this year from over $120 billion in 2016.\n\nCorfield has a \u201cnegative bias\u201d on Colombian bank debt, which may suffer with years of tepid growth. Chilean bank debt remains resilient, while Peruvian lenders look well positioned to seize on the country\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nBond prices could be bolstered on expectations banks may slow fundraising activity this year, she said.\n\nCorfield assigned \u201coverweight\u201d recommendations on Brazilian state-controlled lender Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal\u2019s 4.15 percent BR104277314= and 7.25 percent BR109021296= subordinated bonds due in 2019 and 2024, respectively, as well as Banco do Brasil SA\u2019s 6.25 percent perpetual note BR109021296=.",
