        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co on Friday said it, along with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, agreed to provide secured funding to Bear Stearns, as necessary, for up to 28 days.\n\nKEY POINTS: * The Fed, through its discount window, will provide non-recourse, back-to-back financing to JPMorgan Chase, the commercial bank said. JPMorgan said it does not believe this transaction exposes its shareholders to any material risk. * JPMorgan Chase also said it is working with Bear Stearns on securing permanent financing or other alternatives for the company. * Alan Schwartz, president and chief executive officer of Bear Stearns, said: \u201dBear Stearns has been the subject of a multitude of market rumors regarding our liquidity. We have tried to confront and dispel these rumors and parse fact from fiction. * \u201cAmidst this market chatter, our liquidity position in the last 24 hours had significantly deteriorated. We took this important step to restore confidence in us in the marketplace, strengthen our liquidity and allow us to continue normal operations.\u201d COMMENTS:\n\n\u201dThe Fed and everyone are taking action to make sure this one doesn\u2019t fail. Here is a big difference with Britain ... on how to handle a bank in difficulties. You actually organize your support before you actually go public, unlike Northern Rock.\n\n\u201cThey are very keen to make sure this one doesn\u2019t go. Bear Stearns is too big an international name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is obviously the concern (of more banks in trouble) but ... they will make sure there is a package to make sure this one is OK. I think they will let smaller one goes but big name like this internationally will absolutely not.\u201d\n\nThis tells you we\u2019re not over the worst yet, and there are still some players out there who are vulnerable. We expect more transparency next week when we get results from the U.S. financial sector.\n\nI don\u2019t think the central banks see themselves as there to support anyone and everyone who gets into trouble -- they\u2019re there to support the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not good. It seems all the counterparties to Bear may have pulled all the liquidity lines and therefore they were forced to go to the Fed. Therefore JP Morgan is a kind of a ghost intermediate entity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now back to 154 basis points on the iTraxx Europe index as markets have realized this is very bad news.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens to their (Bear Stearns\u2019) book value from here? It could make them a great takeover target. The question is the quality of their actual book. Is it too unknown to deal with or is it measurable? JPMorgan will step in and get a real good look.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible\u201d that JPMorgan could be looking for an acquisition, he said.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s \u201cpowder is dry, Bear Stearns is small, and it wouldn\u2019t destroy JPMorgan. It\u2019s not like it would be a merger of equals.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt is indicative of how serious the financial crisis is, and the impact that it has on financial firms in the whole financial arena.\n\n\u201cThis is not a positive thing in my view. This is indicative of the kind of crisis that we are in. I do view this as bullish for hard assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation is very much that Bear Stearns was very close to the edge and it was much worse than we all thought. It raises severe concerns over other banks. (Bear Stearns) wasn\u2019t a small bank, it was the second largest underwriter of mortgages last year. For the situation to deteriorate in that way is not good news and it will add further to jitters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation is very much that Bear Stearns was very close to the edge and it was much worse than we all thought.

For the situation to deteriorate in that way is not good news and it will add further to jitters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market chatter about liquidity risk has actually resulted in a run on the bank against Bear Stearns. Investors pulled their repo lines with Bear Stearns. So even if they weren\u2019t in a liquidity crisis before, the rumors became self-fulfilling. The fact that JPMorgan Chase is brokering a line of credit for Bear Stearns via the discount window probably demonstrates that Bear Stearns does not have any qualifying collateral that they can part with at this time to go to the Fed\u2019s discount window directly. It\u2019s positive that JPMorgan Chase is helping to work out this situation because the collapse of a major financial institution would obviously exacerbate the credit crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis mitigates some of the bad news on Bear Stearns.\n\nBut while it\u2019s good news, it does show that Bear Stearns must be really hurting. If two weeks ago they said everything was fine and now they need funding, obviously there\u2019s something else there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother piece of mistrust. The CFO yesterday said fears of liquidity concerns are overblown. He said that in the Wall Street Journal. But what happened in 24 hours that they didn\u2019t know 24 hours ago? But overnight, the company needed a government bail out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the one hand it says Bear Stearns was in big trouble, but on the other hand this should solve the problem for them. It helps ensure stability for whole financial system.\u201d MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: Treasuries initially dropped but quickly recovered. * CURRENCIES: The dollar fell against the euro. * STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes fell.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve, in an emergency move believed not to have been used since the Great Depression, threw a lifeline to Bear Stearns on Friday by making JPMorgan Chase a conduit for funds to the investment bank.\n\nAt a hastily called meeting, the U.S. central bank\u2019s Board of Governors unanimously authorized JPMorgan Chase to borrow from the Fed on behalf of Bear Stearns, which cannot borrow directly from its \u201cdiscount window\u201d -- a privilege reserved for banks that accept deposits.\n\nCommenting on the arrangement, the Fed said in a statement it was ready \u201cto provide liquidity as necessary to promote the orderly functioning of the financial system\u201d -- its third surprise announcement within the past eight days aimed at shoring up shaky credit markets.\n\nThe ultimate size of the Fed\u2019s effort on behalf of Bear Stearns is uncertain and depends on the ability of the investment bank to provide collateral for credit, Fed staff said.\n\nThe process was initiated after Bear Stearns called the Fed, the staff said. That triggered the emergency meeting of the Fed Board on Friday morning.\n\nThe Fed staff members declined to say why JPMorgan was selected as the intermediary.\n\nUnder the arrangement, JPMorgan will post collateral from Bear Stearns at the discount window. The Fed is looking to Bear Stearns for collateral to repay the loan, not to JPMorgan, staff said.\n\nBear Stearns\u2019 need for credit and whether it has collateral to post will determine the potential outer limits of the central bank\u2019s lending, they said, adding that the credit extensions have to be collateralized to the satisfaction of the Fed.\n\nFed staff told Reuters they believed it was the first time such an arrangement had been resorted to since the era of the Great Depression.\n\nThey said that while the precedent of extending central bank credit to non-depository institutions dates to the 1930s, the central bank had authorized lending to non-depository institutions in the 1960s. However, staff said they did not believe companies took advantage of that arrangement.\n\nTo approve the plan, the Fed drew on emergency procedures that allowed the Board to give its OK on a 4-0 vote. Under normal procedures, a minimum of five votes would have been required.\n\nThe normally seven-member Board currency has two vacancies and one member, Frederic Mishkin, was unable to participate in the meeting.",

        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, the head of the Wall Street bank that came to the rescue of Bear Stearns, is a details man, a whiz at numbers, and has a track record of fixing up major banks.\n\nDimon, who has been chief executive of JPMorgan Chase since January 2006 and once had a penchant for boxing in his spare time, is known for his shrewd business judgment.\n\n\u201cJamie Dimon has consistently showed that he is the canniest guy on Wall Street,\u201d said Michael Ryan, a lawyer with Cleary Gottlieb. \u201cJPMorgan has largely escaped the woes of its brethren, leaving it freer than anyone to take advantage of consolidation opportunities.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan on Friday announced it teamed up with the Federal Reserve to provide emergency funds for Bear Stearns after Bear\u2019s cash position significantly deteriorated in a 24-hour period.\n\nThe cash infusion deal was hashed out late Thursday, said a source familiar with the banks\u2019 discussions. Indeed, Dimon was celebrating his 52nd birthday over a family dinner when he got calls about Bear\u2019s plight.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s move is just as provider of emergency cash, although it said on Friday that it was \u201cworking closely with Bear Stearns on securing permanent financing or other alternatives.\u201d Some expect that JPMorgan will look to buy Bear assets, and even to consider a full buyout of the company.\n\nA person familiar with JPMorgan on Friday said the bank is interested, at the right price, in buying the Bear division that provides loans and handles trades for hedge funds.\n\nAnd Dimon is seen as able to move to take advantage of Bear\u2019s current situation.\n\nHe made his mark as leader of Citigroup\u2019s Salomon Smith Barney unit with Deryck Maughan and was considered heir-apparent to Citigroup co-Chief Executive Sanford \u201cSandy\u201d Weill until his 1998 ouster following a falling out with his mentor, Weill.\n\nDimon, who holds an MBA from the Harvard Business School, is known to be financially astute and keen on lean operations -- qualities that delivered results.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s likely to make a boat load of cash for JPMorgan,\u201d said a portfolio manager at a Boston-based fund company. \u201cHe\u2019s quite a manager and he\u2019s going to be making hay buying basically distressed assets at greatly distressed prices. And over the next few years, as long as we do get out of this credit crisis, he\u2019s going to do particularly well.\u201d\n\nCharles Peabody, analyst at independent research firm Portales Partners, said, however, that buying Bear didn\u2019t seem to make strategic sense.\n\n\u201cEven if you were to give Bear away, I think any buyer would need several protections put in place,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cBy Bear announcing the liquidity infusion today and not announcing a buyer -- that shows me that the didn\u2019t have a buyer immediately available.\u201d\n\nFollowing his ouster from Citigroup, Dimon landed at Chicago-based Bank One Corp in 2000 as chairman and chief executive of the No. 6 U.S. bank, but one with problems. He proved adept at turning around the bank, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase in July 2004.\n\nA year after being named CEO of JPMorgan Chase, he added the chairman\u2019s title. Unlike many Wall Street rivals, JPMorgan posted higher profits for its fiscal third quarter -- though just 2 percent -- despite a large write-down on leveraged loans.\n\nThe hard-working Dimon likes playing the guitar and listening to music like Frank Sinatra. He and his wife, Judy, have three daughters.\n\nDimon\u2019s move to step into the brink for Bear Stearns echoes the Panic of 1907 when company founder J. Pierpont Morgan led the charge to stop the bleeding on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action demonstrates the courage of Jamie Dimon and the leadership of JPMorgan in extremely tense times,\u201d said Robert Bruner, author of \u201cThe Panic of 1907\u201d and dean of the Darden Business School at the University of Virginia. \u201cThis rescue will likely mark one of the more important events of the current crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the pattern before,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the worst moments of market anxiety, leaders step in to rescue the pivotal institutions. In 1907, JPM rescued a trust company, the New York Stock Exchange, the city of New York, and various banks and brokerage firms.\u201d",
