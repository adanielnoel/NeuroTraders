        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) must allow shareholders to vote on measures that would tie executive bonuses to the bank\u2019s long-term stock performance, U.S. regulators have ruled.\n\nThe AFL-CIO Reserve Fund, a union investment fund, had sought a shareholder vote to add the measures to JPMorgan\u2019s bylaws. The bank tried to prevent a vote from happening, citing logistical difficulties the move would create for shares already issued, but the SEC said in a letter dated March 9 that the vote should go ahead.\n\nThe fund is proposing that the bank\u2019s most senior executives keep 75 percent of their shares for two years after leaving the company. The fund is also proposing that JPMorgan\u2019s board of directors should prohibit these executives from hedging their shares to offset losses.\n\nJPMorgan had wanted to reject the proposal in part because it may require the bank to impose restrictions on transferring shares already issued and because it has already made changes to executive bonuses, the bank said in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBut the SEC said the fund\u2019s proposal could be rewritten to make it clear it applies to compensation paid in the future, and if it is rewritten it cannot be excluded from proxy materials.\n\nThe AFL-CIO fund is an investment fund for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. It has 2,515 shares in JPMorgan, according to a letter it sent to the bank in November.\n\nPayouts for executives have come under scrutiny as financial stocks have slumped since the start of the credit crunch more than 18 months ago.\n\nJPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has already said he will not receive a bonus for 2008.\n\nShares in JPMorgan have fallen almost 25 percent since the start of the year.",
