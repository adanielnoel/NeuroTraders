        "body": "NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is one of a few U.S. banks strong enough to buy others, and some analysts suspect Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is on the prowl for deals but holding back for the right moment to pull the trigger.\n\nCredit crunches usually spur strong banks to buy weak ones, to pick up assets on the cheap. JPMorgan would seem well positioned to acquire now.\n\nThere are obstacles to buying now, including accounting rules and the ever-weakening balance sheets of many targets, which gives potential buyers an incentive to wait. But many analysts think JPMorgan is at least looking at deals now.\n\n\u201cI am pretty certain they are shopping,\u201d said Michael Nix, a principal at Greenwood Capital Associates, which has $750 million under management and owns JPMorgan shares. \u201cThe fact they haven\u2019t done anything yet suggests to me that they are not so sure we\u2019ve seen the bottom.\u201d\n\nOn a recent conference call, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo asked Dimon, \u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting your whole life for this environment ... so what is the impediment to you pursuing a merger right now in the retail banking side?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is impeding us,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just up to us.\u201d\n\nDimon has said in the past that JPMorgan would look to expand in Florida and California, and experts see several banks that could fit into JPMorgan\u2019s ambitions.\n\nThe list includes banks such as Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N) and Wachovia Corp WB.N that have a presence in the U.S. Southeast and the West Coast, experts said.\n\nOther, somewhat smaller institutions like SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and BB&T Corp (BBT.N) with a presence in the Southeast can help Dimon realize his Florida dreams, they said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got the capital and the access to capital, why not do it when no one else can or when no one else wants it?\u201d asked Cassandra Toroian, chief investment officer at Bell Rock Capital, which owns JPMorgan shares.\n\nWashington Mutual, Wachovia, and SunTrust declined to comment. BB&T spokesman Bob Denham said, \u201cWe are committed as ever to remaining independent.\u201d\n\nToroian said Washington Mutual -- the largest U.S. savings and loan, now weighed down by mortgage losses -- would probably be at \u201cthe top of the list for JPMorgan.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan offered to buy WaMu earlier this year, a person briefed on the matter previously told Reuters, but its $7 billion bid was spurned and the thrift instead opted for an infusion of that size from private equity firm TPG Capital LP [TPG.UL] and other investors.\n\nJPMorgan, which in March agreed to buy Bear Stearns Cos with the encouragement of the U.S. government, may also have U.S. regulators counting on it to step up for a rescue again.\n\n\u201cI am sure the government is also talking to JPMorgan about potential purchases of problem banks,\u201d said Chip MacDonald, a partner at law firm Jones Day.\n\nEven if JPMorgan was scouting for deals, a transaction is likely to take time.\n\n\u201cI have the feeling that JPMorgan is talking to lots of people,\u201d said MacDonald, who declined to discuss potential targets. \u201cBut I would be surprised if anything was imminent.\u201d\n\nUnder U.S. accounting rules, a company that acquires another must record the value of the target\u2019s assets and liabilities at their market value at the time of purchase.\n\nFor many banks in distress, marking assets and liabilities to market would leave them with a negative net worth, and buying such a bank cuts into the acquirer\u2019s capital. Most would-be buyers these days do not have loads of capital to spare.\n\nBoards may also be reluctant to sell when stock prices are depressed. The KBW Bank Index .BKX, which includes 24 major bank stocks, is down roughly 44 percent since the beginning of July last year.\n\nThose drops are good for potential buyers, said William Bates, a partner at law firm King & Spalding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s some opportunity,\u201d Bates said. The difficulty is in getting completely comfortable with a bank\u2019s assets, and being sure write-downs won\u2019t overwhelm the benefits of any acquisition, he added. (Editing by Gary Hill)",
