        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co shareholders cannot pursue a lawsuit to force Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and other officials to pay damages to the largest U.S. bank for their alleged ignorance of red flags signaling Bernard Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld a lower court dismissal of claims that Dimon and 12 other executives and directors breached their duties by turning a blind eye to Madoff, an important client for two decades, to maintain the bank\u2019s lucrative relationship with him.\n\nCiting applicable Delaware law, the appeals court said the shareholders did not show that the defendants \u201cutterly failed to implement any reporting or information system or controls\u201d that might have caught Madoff\u2019s fraud.\n\nIt acknowledged that this standard is \u201cpossibly the most difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment.\u201d\n\nThe Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Fund in Pittsburgh and the Central Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund in Jacksonville, Illinois, which were JPMorgan shareholders, had argued that they needed to show only the defendants\u2019 utter failure to try to implement \u201creasonable\u201d controls, rather than \u201cany\u201d controls.\n\nJPMorgan is based in New York but incorporated in Delaware.\n\nMadoff, 77, is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty to fraud in March 2009, three months after his scheme was uncovered.\n\nA lawyer for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nJPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. A lawyer for the bank directors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWednesday\u2019s decision upheld a July 2014 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan.\n\nThe lawsuit began after JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion to settle other Madoff-related litigation, and enter a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d with federal prosecutors under which the bank acknowledged responsibility for failing to stop Madoff.\n\nThe case is Central Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund et al v. Dimon et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-4516.",

        "body": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase & Co\u2019s brokerage unit will pay $4 million to settle allegations it misled customers about how it paid brokers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday.\n\nThe case stems from comments on the website for U.S. Private Bank, the company\u2019s private bank, which falsely stated that advisers are paid \u201cbased on our clients\u2019 performance\u201d and that \u201cno one is paid on commission,\u201d the SEC said in a statement.\n\nAdvisers, however were paid salaries and discretionary bonuses based on various factors, not client performance, the SEC said.\n\nThe statements, which were made between 2009 and 2012, also appeared in marketing materials distributed to current and prospective customers as well as PowerPoint slides that advisers were to use when making presentations to customers, the SEC said.\n\n\u201cThere was no allegation that the mistake made years ago was intentional or that any client was harmed,\u201d a JP Morgan spokesman said. JPMorgan, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s findings, has improved its procedures to prevent a recurrence, the spokesman said.\n\nEmployees pointed out the false statements on four occasions between 2009 and 2011, but JPMorgan failed to correct the problem, the SEC said.\n\nIn one instance, a private bank employee wrote in a 2009 email to a marketing manager, \u201dWhy not be blunt and say \u2018paid on salary and bonus,\u2019 technically, I do not see any compensation based on the client\u2019s performance.\n\nOther employees sent similar emails to the marketing manager, the SEC said. JPMorgan first corrected the statement in some of its marketing materials in 2012, the SEC said.",
