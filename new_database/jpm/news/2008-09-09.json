Morgan Securities assumed coverage of MetroPCS PCS.N and Leap Wireless International Inc LEAP.O with an \u201coverweight\u201d rating, saying the mobile phone service providers should benefit from rapid subscriber growth and improving margins over the next several years.\n\nThe brokerage, which added MetroPCS to its U.S. Focus list, set a price target of $22 on MetroPCS\u2019 shares and $56 on Leap\u2019s stock.\n\nJP Morgan said customers of both the companies tended to use significantly more minutes than prepaid or postpaid customers and were benefitting from the unlimited monthly plans that the companies offer, and that larger carriers tend to shy away from the companies targeted demographic.\n\nLeap Wireless and MetroPCS typically target youth and ethnic minorities with relatively lower earnings power by offering unlimited calls at flat monthly rates without tying customers to contracts.\n\nThe companies reduce the impact of a volatile churn and lower pricing by spending less on subsidies, marketing and customer care, JP Morgan said.\n\nShares of Leap closed at $46.64 on Nasdaq, while MetroPCS\u2019 stock closed at $17.17 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
