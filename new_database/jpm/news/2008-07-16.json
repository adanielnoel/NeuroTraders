        "body": "NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Although the worst of the credit crisis scarred reputations and frayed relationships between traders and dealers of fixed-income securities, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N kept their clients happiest, a study said on Wednesday.\n\nAmong the largest players, the two institutions scored highest in providing their clients the best support and understanding during the market turmoil, the survey of U.S. institutional investors by Greenwich Associates found.\n\nBanc of America also did well in the survey conducted between February and April -- encompassing the build-up of the crisis that began in the U.S. subprime mortgage market and spread to global financial firms.\n\n\u201cThe findings from this year\u2019s research suggest that dealers\u2019 decisions about the level of support they would provide to clients have had a dramatic impact on the overall reputation of sell-side firms among institutions,\u201d the report said.\n\nJPMorgan was found to have slightly more institutional trading relationships, while Lehman Brothers had slightly more market share.\n\nThe study -- which interviewed 1,246 institutions active in the U.S. fixed income market -- also noted that investors grew increasingly concerned about liquidity risk and the solvency of their counterparties as the crisis escalated.

Morgan Securities downgraded Chicago Bridge & Iron Co (CBI.N) to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight,\u201d on concerns that the engineering, procurement and construction company could take further charges related to its liquefied natural gas projects in Great Britain.\n\nThe cost overruns of $317 million on two terminal projects forced the company to lower its 2008 earnings forecast to the range of 40 cents to 60 cents a share, from its earlier view of $2.40 to $2.65 a share, analyst Scott Levine wrote in a note to clients.\n\nLevine said there was a formidable risk of further charges, and that this risk could last until early 2009.\n\nThe analyst, however, said strong second-half bookings and the resolution of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission dispute would augment positive trends taking place outside Great Britain.\n\nGoldman Sachs also downgraded the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d and removed it from ts Americas Buy List, mainly citing nagging execution risk.\n\nGoldman lowered its six-month price target to $34 from $48.\n\nShares of the company closed at $36.39 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
