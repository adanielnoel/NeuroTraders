        "body": "(Reuters) - JP Morgan added United Therapeutics Corp (UTHR.O) to its focus list of U.S. equities with a $150 March 2009 price target, based on positive expectations for trials of the biotechnology company\u2019s pill to treat lung-related high blood pressure.\n\nThe brokerage said the company will report data from two trials of oral drug Remodulin in pulmonary arterial hypertension over the next six months and it believes there is more than a 70 percent likelihood that both studies are statistically significant and clinically meaningful.\n\n\u201cIn our view, United Therapeutic shares present a compelling risk-reward ahead of the data,\u201d analyst Geoffrey Meacham said in a note to clients.\n\nThe market opportunity for oral Remodulin could top $700 million at peak, Meacham said, and added potential sales of oral Remodulin to the earnings model, assuming $296 million in sales by 2012.\n\nShares of United Therapeutics closed at $113.77 Wednesday on Nasdaq.",

        "body": "Sept 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded speciality chemical maker Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral,\u201d saying it views the current share price as an attractive entry point.\n\nFear over the effects of a slowing global economy and lower oil prices on catalyst demand is creating a purchase opportunity, analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s catalysts are used in petroleum refining.\n\nCompanies that refine oil to produce gasoline and other products had struggled to pass through high crude prices to their customers, and increased the usage of lower grade crudes to shore up their refining margins.\n\nZekauskas believes that lower quality crude use and more stringent environmental regulations should assist catalyst demand.\n\nHowever, Zekauskas downgraded another speciality chemical maker H.B. Fuller Co (FUL.N) to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuller has its work cut out for it over the coming quarters. A large challenge the company faces is to raise adhesive prices within an industry with a fragmented structure during a period of decreasing global end-market growth,\u201d Zekauskas wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cMoreover, decreases in the prices of the underlying commodities (oil and gas) may in fact inhibit price pass thorough during this period of high inflation,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nH.B. Fuller makes adhesives and sealants that are used by packaging, automotive and textile companies.\n\nShares of Albemarle closed at $34.38 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while H.B. Fuller shares closed at $23.28. (Reporting by Hezron Selvi in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)",
