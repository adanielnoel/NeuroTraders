        "body": "April 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is well-positioned to pass the U.S. government\u2019s stress test, and it does not need to issue equity, said Citigroup, which raised its price target on the U.S. banking giant\u2019s stock by 52 percent.\n\nJPMorgan posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, demonstrating the kind of resilience that allowed Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to assert the bank could pay back the government $25 billion immediately. [ID:nN16542451]\n\n\u201cWhile we do not expect Troubled Asset Relief Program repayment near-term, JPMorgan clearly has the financial flexibility to repay the government when the time comes, potentially as soon as later this year,\u201d analyst Keith Horowitz said in a note to clients.\n\nCiting better performance at JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank, though offset by higher credit card losses, the analyst raised his 2010 profit estimates for the bank by 15 cents to $3.30 a share. He raised his price target on the stock to $35 from $23.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan shares fell in morning trade after Bank of America (BAC.N) reported its first-quarter results and said it continued to face \u201cextremely difficult challenges,\u201d primarily from deteriorating credit quality. [ID:nN20380236]\n\nShares of JPMorgan were trading down about 4 percent at $31.93 Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
