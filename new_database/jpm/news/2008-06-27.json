        "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has named Bear Stearns\u2019 former Asia CEO as head of its sovereign wealth group coverage as Wall Street seeks greater access to the financial clout of state-run funds from the Middle East and Asia.\n\nJPMorgan completed the fire-sale acquisition this month of Bear Stearns BSC_pf.N, following its stock plunge and collapse earlier this year. Like the rest of Bear\u2019s employees, the future of former Asia head John Moore was uncertain.\n\nMoore, whose new title is head of Global Sovereign Coverage, will be based in Hong Kong. His appointment was announced internally earlier this month.\n\nJPMorgan Asia Chairman Gaby Abdelnour said in an interview on Friday that of Bear\u2019s roughly 500 employees in Asia, his firm hired a \u201cgood chunk\u201d of them, many of whom are already working in JPMorgan\u2019s Hong Kong offices.\n\nBear\u2019s collapse prompted the cancelling of a proposed partnership between Bear and CITIC Securities (600030.SS), China\u2019s biggest listed brokerage. The proposed partnership included a $1 billion investment in Bear.\n\n\u201cCitic is a client of JPMorgan and we always talk about ideas. Is that going to lead to anything concrete? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Abdelnour said, when asked if JPMorgan would pick-up where Bear left off. \u201cBut is there anything of the Bear deal we\u2019re going to salvage? No.\u201d\n\nAbdelnour was excited about JPMorgan picking up Bear\u2019s securitized products group in Asia, moving most of them from Tokyo to Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business that almost shut down but we think now is a good time to start seriously thinking about it,\u201d he said, adding that project financing and other real asset securitization were areas that this could benefit JPMorgan in Asia.\n\nSovereign wealth funds are the state-run investment vehicles of Middle Eastern countries, of China and Singapore that through commodity prices or trade surpluses have amassed trillions of dollars and increasingly invested it in companies across the world.\n\nMoore will be responsible for maintaining the bank\u2019s relationship with sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) as well as its central banks coverage, two significant growth areas for JPMorgan, Abdelnour said.\n\nMoore will report to Abdelnour and Klaus Diederichs, head of EMEA investment banking.\n\nLast August, New York-based Bear appointed Moore as its Hong Kong-based Asia CEO as it tried to build its business overseas. Previously, he was co-head of fixed income for Europe.\n\nMoore joined Bear Stearns in 2001 as global head of agency capital markets in New York. He moved to London to manage fixed income sales and trading in 2004 and in 2006 became co-head of fixed income in Europe.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s move to hire him as their sovereign wealth chief comes as other Wall Street firms such as Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley have expanded coverage of their relationships with sovereign wealth funds.\n\nInvestment banks are seeking an opportunity following the downturn in financial activity in Europe and North America to boost their presence in emerging markets, where the economies are more buoyant and state-backed funds are looking to diversify their holdings.\n\nA JPMorgan report predicts that assets under management of the more than 50 sovereign funds totaled between $3 to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2007.\n\nSovereign funds have provided more than $43 billion in capital to Wall Street banks starved of funds during the credit crisis that erupted last summer.",
