        "body": "(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), which has been criticized for raising drug prices and is being investigated by the U.S. government, predicted on Monday that lower price increases are ahead for the whole industry.\n\nValeant Chief Executive J. Michael Pearson told investors the company\u2019s 2016 outlook is based on expectations for a new pricing environment where none of its drugs have an actual price increase of more than 10 percent.\n\nValeant shares fell 7.7 percent, or $13.73, to close at $163.83 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nConcerns about drug pricing have loomed over pharmaceutical stocks since last year and the sector\u2019s shares have fallen sharply in the past few weeks since Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticized the price rises on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is being aggressively sort of attacked for past pricing actions,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cI do think, given that environment, the pricing that pharmaceutical companies will take in the future will be more modest.\u201d\n\nValeant, which has become one of the world\u2019s largest drug companies through a steady stream of acquisitions, and others have been criticized for acquiring companies and raising the prices of drugs in order to boost profits. Federal prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts opened investigations into the company, asking for information about price increases as well as the workings of its patient assistance programs for poor people to access its drugs.\n\nPearson said Valeant was unlikely to look for acquisitions based on what he called mispriced assets, or drugs with prices that can be significantly increased because of their value to health care.\n\n\u201cGiven the evolution of our product mix, coupled with the recent events, it is likely that we will pursue fewer, if any, transactions that are focused on mispriced products,\u201d he said.\n\nValeant is also considering selling, spinning off or taking private its neurological and other pharmaceutical business, a move one Wall Street analyst described as paving the way for Valeant\u2019s business model to be less controversial.\n\nThe neurological business accounts for most of Valeant\u2019s price actions and realized price increases on average of more than 30 percent, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a research note. He estimated it to make up about 10 percent of the company\u2019s revenues.\n\nThe move would fit into a strategy that Pearson said has already been underway. Valeant has begun during the past two years to increase sales volumes as a percentage of growth compared with price increases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just be pragmatic and why focus on areas of the business that is just going to create a lot of media stir,\u201d he added, referring to the recent wave of negative publicity over steep price increases for older medicines.\n\nPearson said the company would begin to focus more on research and development, on which it historically has spent little. Last year the company spent $100 million on R&D and it sees that growing to $400 million to $500 million in 2016, with a focus on dermatology, contact lenses and surgical sectors.\n\nPearson indicated Valeant is scaling back on acquisitions, saying that while it continues to look at them, buying back shares may make more sense with the company\u2019s stock at its current price.\n\nValeant reported unexpectedly better quarterly profits earlier on Monday.",

        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals\u2019 platform is shaking beneath Bill Ackman\u2019s feet. The hedge fund manager\u2019s Pershing Square Capital bought a 5.5 percent stake because Valeant offered a cure for poor capital allocation by drugmakers. Now the company is facing the limits of its business plan. It is scaling back on acquisitions, investing more on research and limiting price increases on its drugs. Outsiders missed the political logic of pharma\u2019s spending.\n\nValeant, which has a market value of $59 billion, has been a voracious acquirer. Chief Executive Mike Pearson diagnosed the difficulty of big companies in efficiently discovering drugs, and so Valeant slashed research and development spending at acquired firms and spent little itself. And it seasoned resulting profits by raising prices for many of its drugs.\n\nAckman and Valeant were correct that much of pharma R&D spending is wasted, but they missed the bigger picture. Drug company values are built upon patents and heavily regulated markets. These are creations of society. The discovery of cures to diseases shores up goodwill, and gives politicians and the courts virtuous reasons to support the industry.\n\nCompanies like Valeant have chipped away at this goodwill. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said last month that she had her sights on companies that jacked drug prices but spent little on R&D. Republican presidential candidate Senator Marco Rubio slammed drug companies for \u201cpure profiteering\u201d in raising drug prices in a speech Monday. Formerly anathematic measures such as allowing the government to use its negotiating heft to procure drugs on the cheap for Medicare could soon be on the table and attract bipartisan support.\n\nValeant has felt the wind shift. It will limit realized price hikes on its drugs to less than 10 percent next year. The company is mulling disposing of its \u201cneurology and other\u201d business, which is more reliant on price inflation. R&D spending may double next year, to $500 million.\n\nThat would mean Valeant spends about 4 percent of sales on drug development. Peers like Merck spend four times as much proportionally. Investors worry this may not be enough to escape Washington\u2019s ire. The stock is off about 40 percent from its high this summer. That has forced the company to admit that using its shares to acquire rivals is now out of the question. Valeant\u2019s platform looks shakier by the day.",
