        "body": "(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc said on Friday it would boost its takeover bid for Botox-maker Allergan Inc for the second time this week, contingent on the two sides negotiating.\n\nLaval, Quebec-based Valeant said it would pay $72 in cash - up from $58.30 on Wednesday - and 0.83 share of Valeant stock for each Allergan share. The revised, unsolicited offer was triggered by Pershing Square, the hedge fund controlled by Bill Ackman that is Allergan\u2019s biggest shareholder, agreeing to take only stock in Valeant for its Allergan shares.\n\nThe offer is worth $53.8 billion, up from Wednesday\u2019s $49.9 billion bid.\n\nAllergan shares closed 5.7 percent higher at $167.46 while Valeant shares ended 1.5 percent higher at $131.21.\n\nBMO analyst David Maris said the revised offer will fall short, adding it seemed \u201codd and erratic\u201d that Valeant would raise the bid two days after its chief executive, Mike Pearson, promised not to negotiate against himself.\n\n\u201cIt makes investors scratch their heads when a new bid comes in before the ink is dry on the previous one,\u201d Maris said.\n\nBut analyst Ronny Gal of Bernstein Research said the offer increases pressure on Allergan to take action to raise the company\u2019s value and also to negotiate with Valeant.\n\n\u201cThe offer now appears credible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not think this is a \u2018done deal\u2019 by a long shot, but obviously the likelihood of success is higher now.\u201d\n\nAllergan said in a statement that it plans to consider Valeant\u2019s latest proposal once it receives it. It is best known for its Botox medicine, which is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles. Ackman said he called Pearson on Friday morning and offered to take stock for his Allergan shares if Pearson increased the cash offer to other shareholders. \u201cWe believe that our gesture to the other Allergan owners makes an extraordinarily strong statement about our belief in the long-term value of this highly strategic business combination,\u201d Ackman said in a statement.\n\nThe deal value is based on Allergan\u2019s 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2014, and Ackman\u2019s holding of 28,878,638 shares. Along with cash and shares, it also includes the possibility of additional payments worth up to $7.6 billion related to future sales of an experimental eye drug.\n\nValeant on Wednesday raised the cash component of its bid for Allergan, but the offer disappointed and both stocks dropped.\n\nBuying Allergan would push Valeant closer to its goal of becoming a top-five pharmaceutical company by market cap before the end of 2016, although Pearson also mused on Wednesday about potentially breaking up the company.\n\nAllergan has criticized the sustainability of Valeant\u2019s rapid growth through acquisitions, which included contact lens maker Bausch + Lomb last year.",
