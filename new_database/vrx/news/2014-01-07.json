        "body": "Jan 7 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc , Canada\u2019s largest listed drugmaker, wants to become one of the world\u2019s top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions, it said on Tuesday.\n\nShares of Valeant, which bought contact lens maker Bausch + Lomb Holdings Inc for $8.7 billion in August, were up 10.1 percent at C$132.08 in midday trading in Toronto. The stock more than doubled in 2013 on the strength of the company\u2019s acquisitions.\n\n\u201cUnless you aim high, you don\u2019t achieve high,\u201d Chief Executive Michael Pearson said on a conference call with analysts and investors. \u201cHow we get there, we can\u2019t say at this time.\u201d\n\nMontreal-based Valeant would need a market capitalization of about $150 billion to crack the top five, Pearson said. It is now valued at about $38.4 billion and sits within the top 15 pharmaceutical companies by that measure.\n\n\u201cThe image that comes to my mind is Babe Ruth coming to the plate, pointing to the bleachers and then hitting the ball there,\u201d said Glenn Greenberg, managing director of Brave Warrior Advisors, which controls 6.6 million Valeant shares. \u201cIt shows a certain level of self-confidence.\u201d\n\nGreenberg said he was encouraged by Valeant\u2019s focus on specific types of buys and that the company was not afraid to pass up potential acquisitions if they do not meet its criteria.\n\n\u201cThis guy (Pearson) has created a huge amount of value in the last five years,\u201d he said.\n\nValeant is pursuing a so-called merger of equals as well as smaller deals, but will look this year to pull off one acquisition of similar size to the Bausch purchase, Pearson said.\n\nEven as it pursues acquisitions, the company said it would aim this year to reduce its debt ratio to below four times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from around 4.5 times currently.\n\nValeant officials said their acquisition interests were focused on the Middle East, Asian and Russian markets and include medical devices. In the past, the company has bought companies that sell products directly to consumers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change our strategy,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything short term that we\u2019ll regret doing a year or two later.\u201d\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Valeant forecast increases of about 40 percent this year in revenue and \u201ccash earnings,\u201d which exclude certain items such as acquisition and restructuring costs.\n\nThe company said it expected cash earnings of $8.25 to $8.75 per share, while analysts on average were estimating $8.71, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nValeant expects earnings to be weighted toward the back half of the year, with higher expenses earlier because of product launches, the timing of realizing savings from the Bausch deal, and other factors.\n\nValeant forecast 2014 revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.6 billion. Analysts are expecting $8.279 billion. (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",
