        "body": "Jan 13 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc sought on Wednesday to win back investors, pitching the beleaguered company\u2019s plans to grow revenues internally and sell drugs through pharmacy chain Walgreens.\n\nBut Valeant\u2019s stock, already down about two-thirds since August, extended losses during the company\u2019s presentation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.\n\nShares fell 1.9 percent to $86.21 in New York as the company avoided talking about sensitive areas such as former ties to a specialty pharmacy and investigations into its drug price hikes.\n\nInterim Chief Executive Howard Schiller, in his first public presentation since taking over temporarily for ailing CEO Mike Pearson earlier this month, said there was no update on Pearson\u2019s health.\n\nValeant has a promising roster of new drugs in development and organic - or internally generated - growth amounted to 10 percent last year, the company said. Valeant has grown mainly through acquisitions.\n\n\u201cWe have a team that is unbelievably focused on delivering the goods, doing what\u2019s right and restoring the trust and confidence you have in us and the company,\u201d Schiller said.\n\nSchiller and two other Valeant executives highlighted the company\u2019s distribution deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc pharmacies, announced last month to replace one with mail-order pharmacy Philidor.\n\nThe Walgreens partnership includes two programs, one focusing on dermatology products starting on Friday, and the other aiming to sell about 30 brand-name drugs at generic prices, starting mid-year, said Executive Vice President Ari Kellen.\n\nIn October, shortseller Citron Research accused Valeant of having inflated revenue, and several news outlets, including Reuters, reported on how Philidor used aggressive tactics to try to increase insurer reimbursement, mostly for dermatology drugs. Valeant has denied the shortseller accusations and a board committee is investigating the Philidor situation.\n\nThe company did not provide an update on the investigation.\n\nValeant is also under investigation by government prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts and is the target of a congressional inquiry over concerns about its drug pricing.
