Shares rose 0.5 percent to C$222.81 in late morning trading.\n\nAt 11:08 a.m. EDT (1508 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&P/TSX composite index rose 53.75 points, or 0.41 percent, to 13,058.33.\n\nOf the index\u2019s 10 main groups, eight were in positive territory.\n\nEnergy stocks, bolstered by higher crude prices, climbed 1.0 percent. Canadian Natural Resources rose 2.1 percent to C$26, while Suncor Energy Inc advanced 0.8 percent to C$34.89. Enbridge Inc tempered some of the oil and gas gains, with a 1.1 percent loss to C$49.43.\n\nTighter supplies in the U.S. market helped offset concerns about demand in Asia and pushed U.S. crude prices up 2.1 percent to $45.38 a barrel. Brent crude also added 2.1 percent to $48.34.\n\nThe materials sector, home to mining and other resource companies, also aided the advance, rising 1.4 percent.\n\nThe consumer staples group was among the decliners, slipping 0.3 percent, hurt in part by a 1.2 percent slide to C$60.40 by convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 138 to 98, for a 1.41-to-1 ratio on the upside.\n\nThe index was posting no new 52-week highs and 12 new lows.",
