        "body": "BOSTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Holdings fund is nursing a 12.6 percent loss for 2015, an investor who received Ackman\u2019s letter on Thursday said, marking a dramatic reversal of fortune for one of last year\u2019s best performing managers.\n\nPershing Square tumbled 12.5 percent last month, the investor told Reuters, when one of its biggest holdings, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, was battered by fears that U.S. lawmakers are planning to review price increases of the company\u2019s products. Valeant makes up roughly a fifth of Pershing Square\u2019s portfolio.\n\nOnly four weeks earlier Ackman reported that the firm\u2019s first half gain of roughly 10 percent had been largely wiped out during August\u2019s market sell-off.\n\nThe fund\u2019s losses in August and September have shrunk the size of Ackman\u2019s portfolio from roughly $20 billion earlier in the year to about $16.5 billion now, the person said.\n\nSeptember\u2019s battering put Ackman in line with a string of prominent rival managers, including David Einhorn, Daniel Loeb and Barry Rosenstein, who suffered losses last month that put them firmly into the red for the year.\n\nIt also marks a sharp reversal of fortune for Ackman from last year when Pershing Square was one of the industry\u2019s best performers with a 40 percent gain.\n\nHedge fund managers generally do not comment on their performance as their funds are private.\n\nValeant, of which Pershing Square bought 19.5 million shares earlier this year, was off as much as 30 percent in September before ending the month with a 22 percent drop.\n\nAckman, one of the industry\u2019s most closely followed activist investors, mostly bets that stocks will climb, making his portfolio particularly vulnerable to sharp market declines.\n\nHe likely made some money on his short bet against Herbalife , but it was far from enough to offset other losses.
