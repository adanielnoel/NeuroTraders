Financials, energy, mining and manufacturing were among sectors leading the growth.\n\nThe figures supported the idea that any recession in the first half of the year was short-lived.\n\nThe financials group, which makes up roughly a third of the index, climbed 1.7 percent. Toronto-Dominion Bank rose 2.1 percent to C$52.53, and Royal Bank of Canada jumped 2.1 percent to C$73.53. Six of the index\u2019s 10 most influential gainers were financial names.\n\nAt 11:40 a.m. EDT (1540 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&P/TSX composite index was up 182.59 points, or 1.4 percent, at 13,219.55.\n\nAll 10 of the index\u2019s main sectors were in positive territory. Advancing issues outnumbering declining ones on the TSX by 197 to 42, for a 4.69-to-1 ratio on the upside.\n\nThe TSX has been extremely volatile in the last month and has been on a steady decline since mid-April, having given back some 15 percent during that period.\n\nA Reuters poll released on Wednesday showed that investors believed the index would post its first loss this year since 2011, hurt by concerns including China\u2019s growth and commodity prices.\n\nValeant, regularly a significant mover of the index, jumped 4.7 percent to C$222.10 after tumbling more than 30 percent over the last 1-1/2 weeks. Drugmakers like Valeant have come under fire in recent days over accusations of overcharging for their products.\n\nHudson\u2019s Bay Co jumped 11.4 percent to C$23.10 after the retailer raised its sales forecast following the closing of its acquisition of German department store chain Galeria Kaufhof.\n\nOn the downside, gold miners failed to make gains, shadowed by bullion prices that were on track for their biggest quarterly loss in a year.\n\nHowever, the overall materials group, home to mining and resource names, climbed 1.0 percent.
