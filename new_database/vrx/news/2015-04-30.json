        "body": "(Reuters) - Drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) raised its earnings and sales forecasts for the year on Wednesday and said its chief financial officer will step down.\n\nThe Laval, Quebec-based company, whose top-selling products are heart treatment Isuprel and anti-depressant Wellbutrin, also reported profit and revenue for the first quarter that beat market estimates, helped by a 39 percent jump in U.S. sales.\n\nValeant shares rose in early trade in Toronto and New York.\n\nValeant said Howard Schiller, the company\u2019s chief financial officer since December 2011, will step down once a replacement is found.\n\nSchiller, 53, said he is leaving to pursue other interests, likely with a private company, but would remain on Valeant\u2019s board and seek re-election in May.\n\nSchiller\u2019s move is disappointing to investors, BMO analyst Alex Arfaei said in a note. \u201cValeant is a controversial company with complex, heavily scrutinized financials. Mr. Schiller has essentially been the explainer in chief.\u201d\n\nSchiller collected $23.7 million worth of stock awards in 2014 as he reached the three-year mark with Valeant.\n\nThe company, which lost a bid to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc in November, is often criticized for a growth plan that is driven by acquisitions and cost-cutting.\n\nChief Executive Michael Pearson said he was disappointed that Schiller is leaving.\n\nValeant said it expects 2015 revenue of $10.4-$10.6 billion, up from its previous estimate of $9.2-$9.3 billion, an increase that reflects about $1 billion in sales from its acquisition of gastrointestinal drugmaker Salix, which closed April 1. It raised its adjusted profit forecast to $10.90-$11.20 per share from $10.10-$10.40.\n\nPearson said he is reluctant to use stock to make another major acquisition, but did not rule it out.\n\n\u201cWe are not right now out there looking for a large deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will continue to be opportunistic.\u201d\n\nValeant said sales in the United States rose to $1.40 billion in the first quarter, ended March 31. The country accounts for nearly two-thirds of Valeant\u2019s total revenue.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders was $73.7 million, or 21 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $22.6 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nCash earnings, which exclude one-time items, were $2.36 per share, versus analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.34, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nRevenue rose 16 percent to $2.19 billion, ahead of the Wall Street estimate of $2.15 billion.",
