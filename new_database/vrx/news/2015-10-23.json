        "time": "6:49AM UTC",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investor concerns over accounting practices at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) have put a spotlight on the little-known and fast-growing specialty pharmacy industry.\n\nShares of Valeant fell 19 percent on Wednesday after influential short-seller Citron Research accused the company of using specialty pharmacies, through a network led by its partner Philidor Rx Services, to inflate its revenue, an allegation the drugmaker denied. Specialty pharmacies are designed to deliver medications with unique handling, storage and distribution requirements, often for patients with complex conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. They can provide more detailed guidance for patients on how to take the drugs. Specialty drugs are often expensive, sometimes priced at over $100,000 a year.\n\nThe industry has been growing quickly as drugmakers shift research and sales efforts to more complex medications. Pembroke Consulting estimated early this year that the number of accredited specialty pharmacies would jump by nearly 100 to a total of 250 in 2015.\n\nIn the past, drugmakers were directly involved in distribution of their products. Merck & Co (MRK.N), for example, owned a pharmacy service company known as Medco. But it spun off that business in 2003, partly due to concerns over potential conflicts of interest.\n\nMedco was later acquired by Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), which is now the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager.\n\nA New York Times report earlier this week said that Valeant worked with Philidor Rx Services, based in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, to increase sales, and prices, for treatments that don\u2019t meet the specialty criterion, including drugs for acne and toenail fungus, and that regular pharmacies may not prescribe.\n\nThe same day, Valeant disclosed that a growing percentage of its revenue is coming from products dispensed through specialty pharmacies, and that it had purchased an option to acquire Philidor. Valeant is Philidor\u2019s main customer.\n\n\u201cWe find specialty pharmacies improve patients\u2019 access to medicines at an affordable price, and help ensure physicians are able to prescribe the medications they believe most appropriate for their patients,\u201d Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson told investors on a conference call.\n\nHe said that for many of the company\u2019s skin products, Philidor and other specialty pharmacies fill a customer\u2019s prescription before reimbursement is worked out with an insurer, and that Valeant only recognizes revenue from the products once the drug reaches a patient.\n\nPearson also described how Valeant\u2019s relationship with another specialty pharmacy, R&O Pharmacy LLC of Camarillo, California, turned sour. Valeant said it had shipped $69 million worth of medications at wholesale prices to R&O, and that the pharmacy \u201cis currently improperly holding significant amounts it receives\u201d from insurers.\n\nR&O has sued Valeant in California over its efforts to claim the money, saying it has no contractual relationship with the drugmaker. Representatives of R&O declined to comment.\n\nCitron alleged that R&O and Philidor may actually be the same company, and that the two were used by Valeant to create phantom accounts to inflate revenue. In a statement, Philidor said R&O is part of its network of affiliated pharmacies and that it provides services to those partners including call center functions, help with insurance claims, technical support and \u201ccertain management services.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhilidor does not currently have a direct equity ownership in R&O Pharmacy or the affiliated pharmacies, but does have a contractual right to acquire the pharmacies now or in the future subject to regulatory approval,\u201d the statement said.\n\nScott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic, said the web of relationships raises concern. Cleveland Clinic and other hospitals have been hit financially by Valeant price increases on heart drugs Isuprel and Nitropress.\n\n\u201cThere would be an inherent conflict of interest if a specialty pharmacy is owned by someone making the drug,\u201d Knoer said. \u201cThere could be pressure on the pharmacy to start patients on the drug, or continue patients on it, or not stop them\u201d as warranted. While concerns over Valeant\u2019s ties to its specialty pharmacies hit rival stocks on Wednesday, both Allergan Plc (AGN.N) and Endo International Plc (ENDP.O) were quick to say their businesses did not operate in the same manner.\n\nAllergan said about 3 percent of its U.S. sales of branded drugs are distributed through specialty pharmacies, most of which are specialty products that require careful handling. Endo said it uses specialty pharmacies mainly for branded products that need to be administered by doctors, and that drugs distributed through this channel represent about 3 percent of the company\u2019s projected total revenue for 2015. It said any specialty pharmacies that it works with are fully independent of the company.",

        "time": "12:22PM UTC",
        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals sets the tone for intensifying accounting scrutiny once merger activity slows. The drugmaker\u2019s stock ended Wednesday down 19 percent after a short-seller and others questioned its bookkeeping and relationships with other companies. The $40 billion serial acquirer\u2019s history may make it an obvious target, but as growth and mergers slow a renewed investor focus on companies\u2019 figures is a logical shift.\n\nValeant has bought several dozen firms since 2008. The company\u2019s stock rose more than 20-fold after Chief Executive Michael Pearson took the helm that year to a peak this past summer as deal after deal transfixed Wall Street. Since then, though, the shares have tumbled by more than half. Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s stance against drug companies that raise prices but do little research and development put Valeant\u2019s business model in the spotlight. During its latest earnings call, the company said that it would undertake fewer acquisitions, limit price increases and invest more in R&D.\n\nInvestors are now examining much more closely the stalled Valeant deal machine. There are discrepancies, for instance, in statements from the various parties about how the company is connected to two specialty pharmacies which help dispense drugs and assist patients with payments \u2013 Philador Rx Services and R&O Pharmacy. To make it more convoluted, R&O is suing Valeant. The confusion has sparked questions about Valeant\u2019s bookkeeping for drug sales through pharmacies like these. Valeant has categorically denied any improper accounting.\n\nAmerican healthcare reimbursement is complex, opaque and sometimes prone to fraud. There could be an element of confusion over similar company names. Or it may just be that Valeant\u2019s multiple deals have created a web in which one strand has little idea what another is doing. When chief executives like Pearson do a dozen deals a year, they may spend too little time getting their new charges to work together.\n\nEither way, the Valeant turbulence is a sign of a cyclical change in investor thinking. When growth through acquisitions dries up, there\u2019s greater focus on the reality of sales and profit. Watchdogs, too, have shifted their attention from insider trading to accounting issues. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s newish audit task force, for example, is using special software to spot unusual numbers, dodgy off-balance sheet transactions and auditor changes. As the recent surge of M&A dies down, both investors and regulators may find they have their number-crunching hands full.",

        "body": "BOSTON/NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals\u2019 market slide has hurt the returns of several large U.S. hedge funds, but for smaller players with outsized bets on the drug company the fallout could be far more painful, according to industry watchers.\n\nAmong smaller hedge funds invested in Valeant, at least three had more than 20 percent of their assets tied up in the stock as of June 30, according to data from Symmetric.IO, a research firm that provided the data to Reuters on Thursday. They include Tiger Ratan Capital Management, Marble Arch Investments, and Brave Warrior Advisors, according to the numbers, which are based on publicly reported stock positions and may not include hedges.\n\nIt is not known whether the funds have maintained their holdings into this week, but if they did, they could be looking at losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cThe major risk is with funds that have an unstable, short- term oriented capital base, where a poor few months of performance can lead to significant capital flight,\u201d said Jonathan Liggett, Managing Member at JL Squared Group, an investment advisor. Smaller hedge funds can quickly collapse if investors demand their money back all at once, forcing managers to exit profitable positions to raise cash quickly.\n\nValeant shares are down 35 percent this week after a short-seller\u2019s report accused the company of improperly inflating revenues, igniting fears about federal prosecutors\u2019 probes into its pricing and distribution.\n\nValeant has denied the allegations and its Chief Executive Michael Pearson and other board members are due to address them in more detail in a call with investors on Monday.\n\nThe slump has trimmed billions of dollars off the ledgers of investors such as hedge fund mogul William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management, activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital, and investment firm Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.\n\nBut the impact could be far worse at smaller funds that typically have less than $5 billion in assets and also bet on a stock that had been one of this year\u2019s early winners.\n\nNehal Chopra\u2019s Tiger Ratan owned roughly 1 million shares of Valeant at the end of the second quarter, accounting for about one fifth of her $1.6 billion fund, according to public disclosures. She has owned Valeant for 2-1/2 years.\n\nThrough August, Chopra had been one of the year\u2019s best performers, showing a gain of 21.6 percent for the year. But people familiar with her numbers said heavy losses in September wiped out all gains putting the fund into the red for the year.\n\nIf the firm still held that Valeant position this week its losses on that bet alone would have totaled roughly $370 million for the week. Tiger Ratan declined to comment.\n\nValeant shares, which hit a record high of $263.81 on Aug 6, closed at $109.87 on Thursday.\n\nOther big investors in Valeant at the end of the second quarter included Marble Arch, which oversees roughly $2.3 billion and owned 1.07 million shares, making up 20 percent of its book, data from Symmetric.IO show.\n\nAt Glenn Greenberg\u2019s Brave Warrior Advisors, Valeant made up 36.5 percent of the roughly $3.3 billion fund. Incline Global Management, a $422 million fund, owned 91,368 shares on June 30, translating into a 5.61 percent position, according to the data.\n\nNone of the firms responded to requests for comment.\n\nSome other firms including Barry Rosenstein\u2019s $11 billion Jana Partners and Jeremy Green\u2019s Redmile Group, for example, sold Valeant in recent weeks, helping them sidestep this week\u2019s selloff, people familiar with their investments said.\n\nJana\u2019s flagship fund trimmed some of its losses for the year with a 2.2 percent gain in early October, leaving the fund down 4.5 percent for the year through October 16.\n\nLocust Wood told clients in a letter, seen by Reuters, that the firm exited Valeant last month. \u201cWe took advantage of the downturn in September to move our Valeant holding into Allergan,\u201d the letter said. Last year Botox maker Allergan Inc rejected a hostile takeover bid from Valeant. The letter said that its bet on Valeant netted the firm a 23 percent gain overall.\n\nSome investors said some funds, such as Tiger Ratan, which performed well in recent years, might count on investors forgiving an off year. But smaller funds that showed less dramatic gains might be in a tougher spot.\n\nFor much of the year, Valeant\u2019s quick paced acquisitions helped boost its stock price and made it a favorite with hedge funds which owned roughly 22 percent of the company\u2019s stock at the end of the second quarter, data from Goldman Sachs show.

But Chief Executive Michael Pearson surprised investors earlier in the week by disclosing the company had an option to acquire specialty pharmacy Philidor, which features prominently in the Citron allegations as the center of a network of pharmacies used to artificially boost sales.\n\nQuestions over Valeant\u2019s ties to Philidor and other pharmacies have created doubt among some of the company\u2019s champions on Wall Street.\n\nAlex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets who had long held a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Valeant, downgraded the company on Thursday to \u201cmarket perform.\u201d He said Philidor appeared to be under Valeant\u2019s control, whereas other drugmakers consider their affiliated specialty pharmacies fully independent.\n\n\u201cValeant\u2019s structure may not be illegal, but we find it aggressive and questionable,\u201d Arfaei said in a research note. He added that concerns over Valeant\u2019s handling of the business would linger unless resolved by an investigation.\n\nValeant, which has expanded rapidly through a quick series of acquisitions, has already been under fire for dramatically raising the prices of prescription medicines after it buys the original manufacturer. That is one of several company practices under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts.\n\nOn Thursday, the Autorit\u00e9 Des March\u00e9s Financiers (AMF), which regulates companies based in Quebec including Valeant, said it does not have an active probe into the drugmaker or the short seller at this point.\n\nThe regulator is \u201cwatching very seriously the evolution of the situation,\u201d said Sylvain Th\u00e9berge a spokesman for the AMF in an email, adding that the AMF is in communication with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the matter.\n\nTh\u00e9berge declined to comment on the allegations made against Valeant or provide details of the AMF\u2019s communications with the SEC.\n\nValeant is largely run out of the United States, but it is headquartered in Laval, a suburb of Montreal in Quebec. The company is also incorporated in the western Canadian province of British Columbia.\n\nA spokesman for the British Columbia Securities Commission declined to comment on whether the provincial securities regulator is probing either the company or Citron.\n\nIn the meantime, several analysts said on Thursday they took a more cautious view of Valeant following the Citron allegations.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the accuracy of allegations, we don\u2019t see a quick end to unquantifiable headline risk,\u201d Susquehanna analyst Andrew Finkelstein said in a note.\n\nThe brokerage firm suspended its ratings and estimates on the company, noting that a battle with short sellers means Valeant\u2019s shares are not likely to trade on fundamentals in the near-term.\n\nValeant did receive support from hedge fund manager Ackman, who acquired more shares of the company during its stock meltdown on Wednesday.\n\nPearson also had some social media backing from Martin Shkreli, the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a start-up drug firm, which sparked outrage by raising the price on a decades old drug by 5,000 percent.\n\nValeant \u201cis not overreporting revenue. Give me a break,\u201d Shrkeli posted on Twitter, noting that the company\u2019s sales are in line with prescription drug data from independent research firm IMS Health.

Its loans were trading at 97.75-98.75 on Tuesday before the report, down from 99.5-100 in late September.\n\nValeant\u2019s problems have pulled trading levels lower on a range of pharmaceutical loans, including Concordia Healthcare\u2019s US$1.865bn-equivalent loan, which broke in trading earlier this week.\n\nThe term loans of drug companies Endo International and Mallinckrodt were also pulled lower.\n\nConcordia\u2019s loans were heavily discounted after a difficult primary syndication to compete with falling secondary prices which offered better relative value.\n\nConcordia\u2019s dollar term loans initially traded up over the discount level of 94.5 on Wednesday, but fell to 94.25 bid after Citron\u2019s report.

The company\u2019s loan is nearly 4 points lower than late September, when it was trading at around face value.\n\nDublin-based specialty pharmaceutical company Horizon Pharma\u2019s term loan, which had been quoted 50bp higher at 96.5-97.5 on Wednesday, fell to a 94 offer on Thursday. The term loan is relatively illiquid and loan investors on Wednesday had warned it would move lower.\n\nThe drop in pharmaceutical companies\u2019 secondary loan and equity prices started in late September, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton criticized pricing in the specialty drug market.\n\nLoan investors are concerned about pharmaceutical firms\u2019 response to lower growth opportunities that are depressing share prices and valuations.\n\nValeant\u2019s CEO J. Michael Pearson predicted a new drug pricing environment for the pharma industry when it posted quarterly earnings on Monday and said its 2016 outlook was based on price hikes of no more than 10%.\n\nLow secondary prices continue to put pressure on primary syndications and could result in further discounts and could raise borrowing costs for the sector moving forward.\n\nIn addition to Concordia\u2019s discount, a US$250m term loan for Sucampo Pharmaceuticals was discounted to 97 with a spread of 725bp over Libor and a 1% Libor floor and was quoted at 97.25-97.75 in the secondary market on Tuesday.\n\nSecondary prices for generic drug companies with affordable pricing policies are holding up better. Amneal Pharmaceuticals\u2019 term loan B was at 99.5-100 on Wednesday, down slightly from 100-100.75 market from mid-September.\n\nCompanies that focus on patents and intellectual property have also been less affected.
