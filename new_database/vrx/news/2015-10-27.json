        "body": "(Reuters) - Drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) laid out a detailed defense on Monday of its relationship with a little-known specialty pharmacy, but its arguments failed to calm all investor concerns.\n\nValeant shares have lost more than half their value in recent weeks as the company came under attack on several fronts.\n\nU.S. prosecutors are investigating Valeant over drug pricing, an issue emerging in the U.S. presidential campaign. The falling stock price, in turn, complicates Valeant\u2019s acquisition-driven strategy. And those stock losses accelerated last week when short-seller Citron Research, run by Andrew Left, published a sharply critical report on the company.\n\nThe stock dropped another 2 percent in volatile afternoon trading in New York and Toronto.\n\nLaval, Quebec-based Valeant said it has asked U.S. securities regulators to investigate Citron\u2019s \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d allegation that the company used its ties with a specialty pharmacy to inflate revenue, and said it would conduct a review of its pharmacy network.\n\nAbout a dozen executives, directors, and a former chief financial officer - some of whom Chief Executive Mike Pearson said were operating on little sleep - made up Valeant\u2019s defense team on a conference call with investors and analysts. The call included an unequivocal endorsement of Pearson by lead director Robert Ingram.\n\n\u201c(Left\u2018s) motivation is the same as one who runs into a crowded theater and falsely yells fire. He wanted people to run,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cHe intentionally designed the report to frighten our shareholders to drive down the price of our stock so he could make money for his short-selling.\u201d\n\n\u201dYelling fire in a crowded theater is a lot different than walking into a theater, smelling smoke and yelling, \u2018Hey everyone, there could be a fire.\u2019\n\n\u201cNow the information is out, people have had an opportunity to inspect the theater and they have chosen to leave ... maybe there is fire.\u201d\n\nLeft said on Bloomberg TV that he had not been contacted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He refused to discuss his trading of Valeant.\n\nValeant said it would set up an ad-hoc committee to look into allegations related to the company\u2019s association with specialty pharmacy Philidor. The committee includes Mason Morfit, president of one of Valeant\u2019s largest shareholders ValueAct Capital, who is rejoining the board.\n\nPhilidor said it welcomed formation of the committee and would cooperate with it.\n\nPeter Andersen, chief investment officer at Boston-based Congress Wealth Management, a long-time Valeant investor, said he was impressed with the directors and senior management, but sold his stake Monday because of uncertainty facing the company.\n\n\u201cThey are an excellent example of modern corporate governance in terms of being open and available. I feel they discredited the short-seller\u2019s allegations,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cThe stock is going to be stuck in limbo.\u201d\n\nValeant cleared the air somewhat, but not enough, said BMO analyst Alex Arfaei, in a note.\n\n\u201cThere is still much more that needs to be done to rebuild investor confidence, which we argue has been significantly weakened.\u201d\n\nArfaei said he wondered what other undisclosed business practices Valeant might be involved in that could undermine the stock.\n\nValeant said in a filing Monday it received a subpoena in a U.S. government probe of payments between its Bausch & Lomb division and medical professionals.\n\nValeant should sever its relationship with Philidor so it can focus on its core business, said BTIG analyst Tim Chiang.\n\nBut J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note that concerns about Valeant\u2019s connection with Philidor were \u201coverblown.\u201d\n\nValeant said it paid $100 million in December 2014 for its option to buy Pennsylvania-based Philidor Rx Services Llc, which also included contractual rights, such as influence over certain personnel hirings and a place on a joint steering committee.\n\nPhilidor accounted for about 7 percent of its total revenue and EBITDA in the third quarter, and 44 percent of sales of Jublia, Valeant\u2019s toenail fungus treatment, Valeant said, but added it is not material for reporting purposes.\n\nValeant described Philidor as independent, and said Valeant does not have legal liability for it.\n\nThe company said a board review had found the company in compliance with the law on revenue recognition from drugs sold through Philidor.\n\nValeant\u2019s link to Philidor came under scrutiny after a New York Times report said that Valeant and other drugmakers were using specialty drug distributors to circumvent barriers to raising prices.\n\nValeant has said it properly accounts for sales through its pharmacy partners and only books revenue once one of its medicines reaches a patient.\n\nSpecialty pharmacies are designed to handle complex medications that have unique requirements for storage or administration. But Valeant has also used such pharmacies to sell more conventional medicines directly to patients, and work out reimbursement from insurers afterward.\n\nThat may allow them to get past limits on a drug\u2019s use imposed by insurers or a retail pharmacy. In Valeant\u2019s case, the company has been under scrutiny for its ties to Philidor, which has been accused by one of its affiliates of improper billing practices.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Valeant and Philidor are more interconnected than previously disclosed, and highlighted business practices that included a few Valeant workers who used alternative names, sometimes fictional ones, while working in Philidor\u2019s office.\n\nValeant chief compliance officer Seana Carson said the company\u2019s ad-hoc committee will also review that report.\n\nPearson said Valeant will consider all options, including buying Philidor or severing ties with it, as well as using other specialty pharmacies.\n\nThe acquisitive company has been considering a sale or other options for its neurological business, but such a move is now on the back-burner, Pearson said.",

        "time": "6:56PM UTC",
        "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The pharmacy at the center of suspicions over Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc\u2019s (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) business practices began as a small pilot project two years ago and quickly grew to account for 7 percent of the drugmaker\u2019s revenue.\n\nValeant disclosed on Monday details of its relationship with Pennsylvania-based Philidor Rx Services, defending the pharmacy against allegations of illegal activity while pledging to review the business carefully.\n\nFew Valeant investors had heard of Philidor until last week, when influential short-seller Citron Research said it was being used to create \u201cphantom accounts\u201d and inflate the drugmaker\u2019s revenue. Valeant immediately denied the allegations, but shares in the company tumbled as investors questioned its pharmacy ties.\n\n\u201cWhen you ... construct an unusually complex and not transparent way of doing things, the first question is: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you do it the standard easy way?',\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s law and business schools.\n\nValeant explained on Monday that the pharmacy began as a pilot under Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp, a maker of anti-wrinkle medicines and facial fillers that Valeant acquired in 2012. By January 2013, Valeant began studying how to build up the program, known at the time as the Medicis Alternate Fulfillment Program.\n\nThe pharmacy passed on discounts paid for by Valeant to patients with commercial insurance, often reducing their out-of-pocket costs to zero and helping them to pay for medicines that they could not otherwise afford. When the patient was covered, Valeant would bill insurance companies for reimbursement.\n\nThis process effectively denied patients access to cheaper or alternative drugs and circumvented the way health insurers typically pay pharmacies for drugs.\n\nThe program grew from distributing two drugs to at least 10 Valeant medications, including steroid cream Locoid and acne treatment Solodyn, Valeant said on Monday. Its biggest success may be distribution of the toenail fungus treatment Jublia, as Philidor now handles 44 percent of the drug\u2019s sales.\n\nPhilidor now is licensed in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and also distributes drugs through affiliates in California, Florida, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas. The company said it was ready to cooperate with Valeant\u2019s committee reviewing its business.\n\n\u201cPhilidor\u2019s relationship with Valeant has benefited countless patients by ensuring they receive their medication quickly and efficiently,\u201d Philidor said in a statement. Philidor\u2019s rapid rise led Valeant to spend $100 million in late 2014 on a 10-year option to buy the company for $0. The deal terms include other target-based payments of up to $133 million, $33 million of which have already been paid, it said.\n\nValeant said that Philidor was considering looking to other drugmakers to expand its business model, and the purchase option was meant to stabilize its ties to the distributor. As part of their agreement, Valeant members sit on a joint steering committee with Philidor management, and the drugmaker has the right to influence hiring of key personnel, though it cannot replace the chief executive or management.\n\n\u201cWe do not own or control Philidor,\u201d Valeant board member and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller said during the conference call.\n\nThe size of the purchase option was below the company\u2019s standard for disclosure, Valeant said. Together with the fact that Valeant accounted for Philidor revenue as intercompany sales, the pharmacy dealings were undetectable in its quarterly financial reports.\n\nIn order to comply with accounting standards, Valeant said that it consolidates Philidor revenue as its own, and also that of other specialty pharmacies in the network. That includes R&O Pharmacy, a California specialty pharmacy that is part of Philidor\u2019s network. In recent months, Valeant sent a collection letter to R&O for not paying it for medicines distributed through its network. R&O has since filed suit against Valeant. Philidor also has an option to acquire Isolani, another specialty pharmacy. That pharmacy in turn owns a 10 percent stake in and the option to acquire the rest of R&O. Isolani provides management and administrative services to R&O while Philidor provides back end services, Valeant said.\n\nThe intertwined companies had employees who worked for both Valeant and Philidor, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Valeant did not address that point, but said that the board committee would look into that issue.\n\nCharles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware, said that the committee will likely take weeks or months to report on its findings.\n\n\u201cThey believe there\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s really all we can say for sure,\u201d Elson said.",

Both companies have similar prospects and one is at half the price,\u201d he tweeted on Oct 21.\n\nOn Monday, he said he\u2019d quit the trade with a loss.\n\n\u201cExited the $AGN $VRX trade. 3% loss or so. Bad idea. Onward and upward,\u201d Shkreli tweeted, just hours after Valeant laid out a detailed defense against the accusations of accounting fraud.\n\nShkreli has been vilified on social media and became the symbol for price gouging after Turing raised the price of a recently purchased AIDS and cancer drug, Daraprim, from $13.50 to $750 a tablet. He later said he would lower the price an unspecified amount.\n\nShkreli did not say at what price levels he\u2019d entered the Valeant-Allergan trade, and Valeant shares swung violently that day, trading in a $60 range from the day\u2019s high to low before closing down by $28.13, or more than 19 percent. Allergan, too, had a volatile day, swinging in a $32.49 range before closing lower by $9.89, or 3.2 percent.\n\nIn all, shares of Valeant are down about 25 percent since short-selling firm Citron Research published a report on Oct 21 alleging that the company has used its ties with a specialty pharmacy to inflate revenue..

        "body": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals further tangled its web. The acquisitive $39 billion company tried on Monday to spell out its ties to drug distributors. Analysts didn\u2019t ask \u2013 and a 90-page presentation and call with investors didn\u2019t answer \u2013 why it obscured the dealings in the first place. The messy details also only go to confirm some fears about Valeant.\n\nAt issue most urgently is Philidor Rx Services, a company Valeant says it doesn\u2019t own or control. Even so, Valeant paid $100 million in 2014 for an option to buy the pharmacy for nothing over the next 10 years. Nearly all of Philidor\u2019s sales are of Valeant\u2019s drugs, and Valeant consolidates its financial figures. Valeant also has the right to approve important roles at the firm.\n\nThe opaque structure is troubling. What\u2019s more, the situation is more byzantine than originally imagined. Philidor has the right to buy a pharmacy called Isolani, which owns the right to buy R&O Pharmacy. Such a camouflaged trail can\u2019t sit well with investors. The lack of clarity also makes it hard to ignore reports by the Wall Street Journal that Valeant employees used alternate identities while stationed at Philidor, and an R&O founder\u2019s claims that Philidor and subsidiaries shipped drugs to states where they didn\u2019t have a license.\n\nDefenses offered by Valeant Chief Executive Mike Pearson mostly ring hollow. He claims the company didn\u2019t bother disclosing the $100 million payment to buy Philidor because the matter was immaterial. That was a clear miscalculation. The nearly 40 percent fall in Valeant\u2019s stock since the relationship emerged, and a quickly assembled conference call involving the top brass, is evidence enough.\n\nValeant will have to keep defending its dealings. The U.S. Department of Justice has issued a subpoena into possible violations of federal healthcare rules by subsidiary Bausch & Lomb. Prosecutors in Massachusetts and New York have opened investigations into Valeant\u2019s patient-assistance programs. And the Federal Trade Commission is probing its acquisition of Paragon Holdings. The best that can be said of Valeant\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to clear the air on Monday is that it might help the company see how much more explaining it has to do.",

        "body": "NEW YORK, Oct 26 (IFR) - Valeant bonds were volatile on Monday morning but steadied after the drugmaker\u2019s management sought to alleviate investor fears of potential fraud at the company.\n\nOne high-yield investor said Valeant\u2019s 5.5% 2023s traded as low as 83.5 before steadying to around 86 after the company said a board review had found the company was in compliance with the law on revenue recognition from drugs sold through the specialty pharmacy Philidor.\n\nIts Board of Directors has set up an ad hoc committee to review allegations by short seller Citron Research related to the company\u2019s business relationship with Philidor and related matters.\n\nCitron Research accused the drugmaker of using Philidor to create \u201cphantom sales\u201d of its products or push more product through distribution channels than sales would warrant, an allegation that Valeant has denied outright.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that management did a reasonable job conveying that their accounting is above board. The call removed fears that there was a legal or accounting fraud issue,\u201d said one of the investors who owns the 2023 bonds.\n\nBut he said there was still a feeling that the company was acting \u201cat the edge of the letter of the law\u201d and that further weakness in Valeant\u2019s bonds was likely.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue was allegations about revenue inflation,\u201d said the investor. The company appeared to pour cold water on those concerns.\n\nValeant said on its call with analysts that it only recognizes revenue when products are dispensed to patients and records this at net realized price.\n\nBlasting Citron\u2019s claims as \u201ccompletely untrue,\u201d Valeant chief executive Michael Pearson said the company has asked the SEC to investigate the research firm and his founder Andrew Left.\n\nIn an email to IFR, however, Left stood by the contents of his firm\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cBefore accusing me of market manipulation, Pearson should ask himself why Philidor was undisclosed to Valeant shareholders,\u201d Left said.\n\nHe accused Valeant of not disclosing a payment of US$100m for an \u201coption\u201d to purchase Philidor, the posting of Valeant senior staff onsite at Philidor, and the consolidation of Philidor\u2019s revenue in Valeant\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nValeant revealed new information earlier this month about its dealings with specialty pharmacies, including Philidor and R&O Pharmacy Inc, which are designed to handle medicines that require complex storage or administration and distribute specialty drugs to patients, and that it had purchased an option to acquire the pharmacy Philidor and was already consolidating its results.\n\nIt has also been subpoenaed by U.S. prosecutors seeking details on its patient assistance programs, drug pricing and distribution practices.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019ve got to work through the various regulatory issues, including multiple subpoenas which will take 6-12 months,\u201d said the investor.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see the bonds trading back to where they were until the muddy waters are cleared.\u201d (Reporting by Natalie Harrison and Davide Scigliuzzo; editing by Jack Doran and Shankar Ramakrishnan)",

He wanted people to run,\u201d said Chief Executive Mike Pearson. \u201cHe intentionally designed the report to frighten our shareholders to drive down the price of our stock so he could make money for his short-selling.\u201d\n\nValeant\u2019s lead director Robert Ingram said the company\u2019s board has \u201ccomplete and total faith\u201d in Pearson.\n\nCitron\u2019s Andrew Left did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "body": "Oct 26 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc laid out a defense of its relationship with a specialty pharmacy on Monday, but failed to dispel all investor concerns.\n\nThe drugmaker is in the spotlight over its pricing and accounting practices and overall strategy of a rapid acquisition-driven expansion and aggressive drug price hikes.\n\nFollowing is a summary of key events in Valeant\u2019s history:\n\nDecember 2007: Biovail Corp of Canada, Valeant\u2019s predecessor, pays $138 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit accusing it of making false statements to inflate its stock price. February 2008: California-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals International names McKinsey & Co veteran and pharmaceutical acquisitions expert Michael Pearson as its CEO. It buys Coria Laboratories for $95 million and Australia\u2019s DermaTech for $12.6 million that year.\n\nMarch 2008: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges Biovail Corp, its former CEO, and three other senior executives with fraudulent accounting and making a series of misstatements to analysts and investors. January 2009: Valeant buys Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences Inc, a maker of topical dermatology products, for $285 million and buys Mexican generic drugmaker Tecnofarma. May 2010: Valeant buys Aton Pharmaceuticals, a New Jersey-based maker of ophthalmology products, for $318 million.\n\nSept 2010: Valeant is acquired by Biovail in a reverse merger. Pearson becomes CEO of the combined company with an annual revenue of $1.75 billion. It takes Valeant\u2019s name and is incorporated in Canada, where Valeant predicts to have a 10-15 percent tax rate, far below the U.S. levels.\n\n2011: Valeant settles a civil lawsuit brought by the SEC accusing Biovail of accounting fraud. It boosts its presence in Central and Eastern Europe by snapping up Switzerland-based generic company PharmaSwiss for $481 million; AB Sanitas of Lithuania for about $500 million; Canada\u2019s Afexa Life Sciences and Sanofi SA\u2019s dermatology unit Dermik. However, its $5.7 billion unsolicited bid for U.S. biotech Cephalon loses to an almost $7 billion offer from Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\n2012: Valeant buys Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp for $2.6 billion, acquiring anti-wrinkle medicines and facial fillers that compete with Allergan Inc\u2019s market-leading portfolio.\n\nApril 2013: Valeant offers more than $13 billion in stock for smaller U.S. rival Actavis Inc, but merger talks collapse.\n\nAugust 2013: In its biggest deal ever, Valeant buys eye-care company Bausch & Lomb from private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $8.6 billion. January 2014: After making the list of world\u2019s top 15 drugmakers by market capitalization, Pearson tells analysts Valeant aims to crack the top 5 by the end of 2016.\n\nMarch 2014: Jim Grant, editor of an investment journal, criticizes Valeant for its lack of concern for research and development.\n\nApril 2014: Valeant and activist investor William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund team up to buy Allergan. May 2014: Bronte Capital\u2019s John Hempton says his fund is shorting Valeant, calling its accounts \u201cdifficult to comprehend.\u201d James Chanos, founder of Kynikos Associates and short on Valeant accuses it of \u201caggressive accounting games.\u201d\n\nJune 2014: Allergan, battling off Valeant\u2019s takeover attempt, releases email exchanges with Morgan Stanley in which the bank called Valeant a \u201chouse of cards.\u201d Nov 2014: Valeant and Ackman end their pursuit for Allergan after rival Actavis outbids them with a $66 billion offer.\n\nMarch 2015: Pershing Square discloses it has taken a 5 percent stake in Valeant.\n\nApril 2015: Valeant completes its $11 billion purchase of Salix Pharmaceuticals, a maker of gastrointestinal medicines. June 2015: Long-time investor ValueAct Capital Management says it sold 4.2 million Valeant shares, but retains a stake worth over $3 billion.\n\nSept 28, 2015: Democratic members of a Congressional committee urge their chairman to subpoena Valeant over \u201cmassive\u201d price increases for two of its heart drugs.\n\nOct 15, 2015: Valeant says it has been subpoenaed by U.S. prosecutors seeking details on its patient assistance programs, drug pricing and distribution practices.\n\nOct 19, 2015: New York Times reports how Valeant has used its ties with a specialty pharmacy Philidor to sell conventional medications, averting health insurer barriers to reimbursement.\n\nIn a conference call later that day, Valeant discloses for the first time that it has used Philidor\u2019s services, has an option to buy the pharmacy and has already incorporated its financials into its own results.\n\nOct 21, 2015: Valeant shares plunge as much as 40 percent after an influential short-seller, Citron Research, accuses the company of using specialty pharmacies, including Philidor, to inflate its revenue. Valeant categorically denies the allegations.\n\nOct 26, 2015: Valeant holds investor call to defend itself against Citron\u2019s allegations and sets up an ad-hoc committee to study them in depth.. Valeant shares end 5.3 percent down.",
