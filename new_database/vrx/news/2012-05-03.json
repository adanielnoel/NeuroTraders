        "body": "(Reuters) - Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) tumbled 9 percent on Thursday after at least one analyst cast doubts about an earnings forecast that initially triggered a sharp rise in the Canadian drug company\u2019s shares.\n\nCash earnings reported by Valeant, which has been on an acquisition spree, benefited from one-off gains from the sale of a dermatology asset and a foreign exchange transaction, said Neil Marouka, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity.\n\n\u201cWhen they provided clarity on some of the gains included in the cash EPS calculation, it became apparent that the quarter was a little bit weaker than expected,\u201d Marouka said.\n\nAs a result, the increased forecast for earnings per share for the year was also closer to 25 cents than 50 cents, the number quoted by Valeant, he said.\n\nThe stock had risen as much as 6 percent to a nine-year high after the company raised its 2012 cash earnings forecast by 50 cents a share to a range of $4.45 to $4.70. It raised its revenue forecast to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, from $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion.\n\nMarouka said the dermatology asset sale was worth about 15 cents a share and the foreign exchange gain, from an inter-company loan, was worth about 10 cents.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, Valeant\u2019s stock was down 9.4 percent at C$50.49 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has risen by about 43 percent in the past six months.\n\nValeant reported cash earnings per share of 99 cents per share, ahead of the 98 cents a share that analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nValeant, which has made a raft of acquisitions this year, also said it would buy some assets from skincare products maker University Medical Pharmaceuticals Corp for about $64 million. The deal will close by the middle of 2012, Valeant said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, Valeant reported a net loss for the first quarter of $12.9 million, or 4 cents a share. That compared with a net income of $6.5 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier.",
